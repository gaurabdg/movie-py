REPORTER:...but police have already set up a blockade here around the area.
As you can see, we've got just about as close as we can, but unfortunately,
Montana right now is on complete lockdown.
WOMAN: The object apparently touched down 40 minutes ago, just north of I-94.
We 're waiting to hear if this is perhaps an experimental vessel or...
Hold on, it...
I'm learning that more objects like this have landed in as many as eight other locations around the world.

So, you're saying it's not ours?
Do you even know if it's from Earth?
WOMAN:
We 're still collecting information.
We're coordinating with other countries.
We're not the only ones to have one of these in our backyard.
WOMAN 2: If this is some sort of peaceful first contact, why send 12?
Why not just one?

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom.
I'm watching the same news coverage you are.
Well, Mom, please don't bother with that channel.

Those people are idiots.
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?
Okay. Exactly. So...
Um, me? Yeah, um, you know me.
I'm about the same.
Mom, I'm fine.
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.
REPORTER: And around eight hours after landing, there are still no signs of what might be called

We never formally met, but two years ago, you did some Farsi translations for Army Intelligence.
Oh.
You made quick work of those insurgent videos.
You made quick work of those insurgents.
You are on the top of everyone's list when it comes to translations.

Assume they were not speaking at the same time.
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...
How would you approach translating this?
Do you hear any words? Phrases?
I don't... I don't know.
So what can you tell me?
I can tell you that it's impossible to translate from an audio file.
I would need to be there, to interact with them.
You didn't need that with the Farsi translations.
I didn't need it because
I already knew the language, but this... This is... Ah...
I know what you're doing.
Tell me what I'm doing.
I'm not taking you to Montana.
It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site for everybody who has a TS clearance.
I'm just telling you what it would take to do this job.
This is not a negotiation.
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

The readings do not change, but I don't know, it's like we're insects on a piece of paper, and they're easing us out of the house.
At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds, gravity starts to shift and slides us out of the room.
Have you found a scientific explanation for it?
Like, is it for them?
Uh, no. We think it's for us.
Air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber, so after about two hours, we run out of oxygen.
It doesn't take 18 hours to pump fresh air into a room.
IAN: Atmosphere...
HALPERN: Excuse me?
If their atmosphere is different from Earth, it would certainly take hours to rebalance their O2 content and pressure for us every time they open their door.
So, they could suffocate us if they wanted.

I don't wanna take away from your success in there, but Dr. Banks, is this really the right approach?
Trying to teach them how to speak and read?
That's gotta take longer.
You're wrong. It's faster.
Everything you do in there,
I have to explain to a room full of men whose first and last question is...
"How can this be used against us?"
So you're gonna have to give me more than that.
Kangaroo.
What is that?
In 1770,
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground off the coast of Australia, and he led a party into the country, and they met the Aboriginal people.
One of the sailors pointed at the animals that hop around and put their babies in their pouch, and he asked what they were, and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."
And the point is?
LOUISE: It wasn't till later that they learned that
"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,
I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there.
Otherwise, this is gonna take 10 times as long.
I can sell that for now.
But I need you to submit your vocabulary words before the next session.
Fair.
And remember what happened to the Aborigines.
A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.

They can't seem to follow our algebra, but complex behaviors, that clicks.
Well that doesn't make any sense at all, does it?
Problem is, not everyone shares our policy of being open with the aliens.
Have you met General Shang?
The call sign for him is Big Domino.
Whatever Shang does, at least four other nations will follow.
Louise? We have to gain ground today.
Okay.
You have a vocabulary list for me?
I do.
You're gonna teach them your name and Ian's?
Yes, so that we can learn their names if they have names, and then introduce pronouns later.
These are all grade-school words: eat, walk.
Help me understand.
Okay. Um...
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!
Okay, this is where you wanna get to, right?
WEBER: That is the question.
Okay.
So, first, we need to make sure that they understand what a question is.
Okay, the nature of a request for information along with a response.
Then, we need to clarify the difference between a specific "you" and a collective "you," because we don't wanna know why Joe Alien is here, we want to know why they all landed.
And purpose requires an understanding of intent.
We need to find out: do they make conscious choices?
Or is their motivation so instinctive that they don't understand a "why" question at all?
And... And biggest of all, we need to have enough vocabulary with them that we understand their answer.

Stick to your list.

(PEN SCRAPING ON PAPER)
IAN: Here are some of the many things we don't know about heptapods.
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."
Seven feet. Heptapod.
Who are they?
Trying to answer this in any meaningful way is hampered by the fact that, outside being able to see them and hear them, the heptapods leave absolutely no footprint.
The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown.
The shell emits no waste, no gas, no radiation.
Assuming that the shells communicate with each other, they do so without detection.
The air between the shells is untroubled by sonic emission or light wave.
Are they scientists? Or tourists?
If they're scientists, they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.
Why did they park where they did?
The world's most decorated experts can't crack that one.
The most plausible theory is that they chose places on Earth with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes.
But there are exceptions.
The next most plausible theory is that
Sheena Easton had a hit song at each of these sites in 1980.
So, we just don't know.
How do they communicate?
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.
The first breakthrough was to discover that there's no correlation between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.
Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.
Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted opportunity, passing up a second communications channel.
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank for their study of how heptapods write, because unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.
Like their ship or their bodies, their written language has no forward or backward direction.
Linguists call this non-linear orthography, which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands, starting from either side.
You would have to know each word you wanted to use, as well as how much space they would occupy.
A heptapod can write a complex sentence in two seconds, effortlessly.
It's taken us a month to make the simplest reply.
Next, expanding vocabulary.
Louise thinks it could easily take another month to be ready for that.
LOUISE: Hey...
Oh, hey.
Weber's looki ng for you.
Yeah, well, why do you think

I will take that as a compliment.
Yeah, well, it is.

As I watch you steer us around these communication traps that I didn't even know existed, it's like, "What?"
I guess that's why I'm single.

You know it's okay to be sad that your dad and I...
I know. I'm not.
'Cause we both love you very much.
I know. It's just a cartoon. It's not real.
IAN: Louise?
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm not sure it's something
I can... I can explain.
WEBER: When was your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?
I'm okay.
I'm gonna get some air.
I'm okay.
All right.
I'm fine. Yep.
IAN: How you feeling?
LOUISE: Um...
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.
Yeah.
You know, I was doing some reading, um, about this idea that if you immerse yourself into a foreign language, then you can actually rewire your brain.
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
Mm-hmm.
The theory that, uh...
It... It's the theory that, uh, the language you speak determines how you think and...
IAN: Yeah. It affects how you see everything.
It was, uh...
I'm curious...
Are you dreaming in their language?
(BIRD CHIRPING)
I may have had a few dreams, but I don't...
(CHIRPING CONTINUES)
I don't think that that makes me unfit to do this job.
(GROWLING LOUDLY)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Did you sleep?
A little.
Do you know Mandarin?
MAN: It is shifting.
WEBER: The voice you're about to hear belongs to a Chinese military chief...
General Shang.
Pull it up!
We got a satellite feed here of who he's talking to, if you want to look.
Wait, go back.
Stop.
He's saying that each of the 12 is offering advanced technology.
Go back again. And play.
Um...
"Our science team is attempting to decode the sets."
"Sets." I don't know what that means.
Something about advantage, suits, honor and, uh, flowers.
I don't...
I don't know. That's all.
I don't know what it means either.
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.
And now, Russia's following suit.
Shang's about to start something.
Following suit. Suits.
Suits, honor, flowers...
Colonel, those are all tile sets in mah-jongg.
God, are they...
Are they using a game to converse with their heptapods?
Maybe. Why?
Well, let's say that
I taught them chess instead of English.
Every conversation would be a game.
Every idea expressed through opposition, victory, defeat.
You see the problem?
Hmm...
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...
Everything's a nail.
We need to ask the big question.
Ready or not.
(INDISTINCT)
Yeah, I know, but between there and there.
(ALARM SOUNDING)
Well, it's time to go.
(MAN SPEAKING ON RADIO,
INDISTINCT)
LOUISE: Okay...
Heptapods' purpose.
Heptapod purpose Earth.
What is your purpose?
(HEPTAPOD CHITTERING)
IAN: Do we only have Costello?
Okay. There you are.
WEBER: What does it say?
Offer weapon.
You saw what they wrote!
Using a word they don't fully understand.
Could be a request.
A warning.
Enough! Louise?
We don't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and a tool.
Our language, like our culture, is messy, and sometimes, one can be both.
IAN: And it's quite possible that they're asking us to offer them something, not the other way around.
It's like the first part of a trade.
So, how do we clarify their intentions beyond those two words?
Well, I go back in.
Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.
It's more complicated than that.
How is it more complicated than that?
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you.
We need to sit on this information till we know what it means, so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.
We must consider the idea that our visitors are prodding us to fight among ourselves until only one faction prevails.
There's no evidence of that.
Sure there is.
Just grab a history book.
The British with India, the Germans with Rwanda.
They even got a name for it in Hungary.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Yeah. We're a world with no single leader.
It's impossible to deal with just one of us.
And with the word "weapon" now...
Halpern. Yes, sir!
(SIREN WAILING)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
(SPEAKING ARABIC)
MAN: No confirmation yet. Standing by.
HALPERN: Anything? What did they say?
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking to anyone.
Whatever they learned in their last session has them spooked.
Yes, sir!
We have orders to do the same.
These are our allies!
You can't shut us down!
Put us on radio silence.
Do it.
We received a message from the hept... Damn it!
We need to be talking to each other!
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.
MAN: Base-camp talk is now offline.
All interpreters and international liaisons, stand down and report to unit coordinators.
LOUISE: We've never re-entered a session before.
IAN: Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.
We've just gotta step on it, all right?
WOMAN: (ON TV) "Use weapon."
This is the alien message said to have provoked the Chinese government to withdraw their scientists from the international mission today.
In a statement, General Shang said,
"China no longer trusts the aliens
"who want to divide us.
"Humanity must be protected."
China has asked for immediate talks at the UN.
MAN: (ON RADIO) Alpha-one-niner, this is Condor, over.
Alpha-one-niner, this is Condor, come in. Over.
Captain Marks, Condor not receiving transmission.
Squelch twice if you hear line.
Captain Marks, all escort units are ordered to cease all activity.
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.
LOUISE: I just need to ask one question.
MARKS: Dr. Banks!
The session is finished.
You can't... You can't go back in. It's dangerous.
IAN: Look, we just need five minutes. Don't sweat it.
LASKY: Marks, let them go.
LOUISE: Hey, Abbott!
So, what are we calling this?
Session 37?
IAN: Uh, no, 36, part 2.
WEBER: Why are they on their own?
MAN: We've been attempting to hail Captain Marks.
The escort units are not responding, sir.
WEBER: Why not? Send security.
"Offer weapon, question mark."
Are you offering us something?
IAN: Technology, apparatus, method?
Yeah, see, this is a different word.
This... This segment, it's a lot busier.
Give technology now.
(TAPPING ON GLASS)
What's he doing?
(TAPPING REPEATEDLY ON GLASS)
MAN: (ON RADIO) Captain, on your ten.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
LASKY: Security detail inbound, sir.
T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.
SOLDIER 2: Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.
MARKS: We just need to hold them off until it's done.
LASKY: Copy that.
Warning shots and suppressive fire only.
MARKS: Load up and get to cover.
Stay frosty and we can avoid casualties.
(POUNDING)
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.
Can you even do that?
I don't know.
I can't do it with both hands.
(EXHALING SHARPLY)
Louise...
(GUN FIRE)
LOUISE: What is that?
(MEN SHOUTING)
(HEPTAPOD MOANING LOUDLY)
(GASPING)
DR. KETTLER: Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.
How do you feel?
How is Ian?
Same as you. He's okay.
Who, um... Who did this?
Ah, some soldiers.
They've been watching too much TV.
(ALARM SOUNDING)
What is that?
Take it easy. Take it easy.
(HELICOPTER BLADES THUMPING)
The site's no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.
Where's Ian?
Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.
He wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.
Your whole tent is on the clock to figure out whatever it is you were given up there.
This is all of it?
The feed wasn't interrupted by the explosion?
WEBER: Not as far as I can see.
You see something?
IAN: Oh, I don't know yet.
I'm gonna need my team to get together with Louise's team.
I need everybody working on this.
We cannot leave.
Glad to see you're awake.
We need to go back in and explain this wasn't our fault.
WEBER: We can't go back inside.
We have to.
What happened in there was an attack.
We can hope for the best, but I have orders to prepare for retaliation.
We may have to evacuate.
No, that's the wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.
(RUMBLING)
Well, they're not leaving.
Why does this feel worse?
MAN: (ON SCREEN)
China is on the offensive.
They're positioning the military to blow the alien vessel right out of the sky.
And if this happens, we can't sit around waiting for retaliation.
So, get prepared.
The Air Force and infantry are standing by.
Yes, sir.
Tonight, China becomes the first world power to declare war against the aliens.
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts at the United Nations,
China has confirmed that its language experts have tonight delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site.
In a televised statement,
General Shang, chairman of the People's Liberation Army, said the aliens have 24 hours to leave Chinese territory or face destruction.
And he urged all other world leaders to unite with China and take a similar stance.
With a huge buildup of forces at their landing sites,
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan are thought to be following China's lead.
It can't be random.
IAN: It's going to take us years.
HANNAH: What's this term here?
Mom...
Mom...
Hmm? Sweetie...
Uh, what's this term for that thing, like a... Like a technical term, where we make a deal, and we both get something out of it.
A compromise.
No...
Like, it's a competition.
Mm-hmm...
But both sides end up happy.
Like a win-win.
More science-y than that.
If you want science, call your father.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
IAN: Thank you.
(PAPERS RUSTLING)
Sorry.
It's okay.
(CLEARING THROAT) I'm up.
What time is it?
IAN: It's time you opened that bottle you've been hiding.
You cracked something, didn't you?
Yeah. Come here.
Take a look at this section.
It seems to be talking about time.
Their symbol for time is everywhere.
So what is this?
A formula for faster-than-light travel?
Who can tell?
There are too many gaps.
Nothing's complete.
Then it dawned on me.
Come here.
Right here.
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.
How much of this is data?
How much of it is negative space?
So, I measured it.
0.0833 recurring.
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.
One of twelve.
What they're saying right here is that this is one of 12.
"We are part of a larger whole."
Or we're one of 12 contestants for the prize.
Why do I have to talk to him?
We're all working together.
We need to talk to the other sites, help them with what they've gotten from the heptapods.
We're blacked out.
China just threatened to destroy their shell.
We're on our own.
But this says that all of the pieces fit together.
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.
Two hours ago, we pulled this audio off a secure channel in Russia.
Someone on the science team there was broadcasting wide.
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN,
WOMAN TRANSLATING)
In their final session, the aliens said,
"There is no time. Many become one."
I fear we have all been given weapons.
If anyone is receiving this, please...
(MACHINE GUN FIRING
ON RECORDING)
(RECORDING ENDS)
Well, I mean, there are a lot of ways you can interpret what he said.
I don't need an interpreter to know what this means.
Russia just executed one of their own experts to keep their secret.
"Many become one" could just be their way of saying
"some assembly required."
Why hand it out to us in pieces?
Why not just give it all over?
What better way to force us to work together for once?
Even if I did believe you, how in the world are you gonna get anybody else to play along and give up their data?
We offer ours in return.
Yeah?
A trade?
IAN: It's a non-zero-sum game.
Non-zero-sum game.
That's it. Yeah.
Thanks.
HALPERN: Nine of the landing sites have gone total comms blackout.
Only way to reach them is to physically drive there and yell at the border guards, which we're doing, but it won't be fast enough.
There must be a way to get the message to them.
HALPERN: To our allies, maybe, but it's too little too late.
What we need is to get all the other nations online before one starts global war.
And there's no way for us to reach them.
IAN: Okay, hold on a second. There is!
It's right above us.
WEBER: That's problematic for us right now.
The Pentagon's convinced our shell will retaliate.
My guess is they'll order us to evacuate within the hour.
IAN: Look, they're not our enemy.
They've made no act of aggression towards us.
HALPERN: Maybe this is their way of being aggressive.
WEBER: That's not the question.
HALPERN: What is the question?
WEBER: How do we get you back in that room when it's half a mile straight up?
HALPERN: I think our work here is done.
It's in the hands of our superiors now.
(RUMBLING)
HALPERN: What the hell is she doing?
(CYLINDER RUMBLING,
LOUISE GASPING)
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!
(COUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
(COUGHING)
(HEPTAPOD GROWLING)
(THUMPING)
(RHYTHMIC THUMPING)
Costello...
Where's Abbott?
(HEPTAPOD GROWLING)
(CHITTERS)
I'm sorry.
We're sorry.
I need you to...
I need you to send a message to the other sites.
I don't...
I don't understand.
What is your purpose here?
How can you know the future?
(DRONING)
I don't...
I don't understand. Who is this child?
HANNAH: The show is called
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."
Wait! No! Wait!
(CRASHING, RUMBLING)
WEBER: Dr. Banks!
IAN: Louise!
WEBER: Are you all right?
You all right?
LOUISE: Yeah. I'm all right.
IAN: What happened?
LOUISE: I'm trying to figure it out.
This is too big.
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.
LOUISE: Why?
Russia and Sudan are following China.
I don't understand.
HANNAH: Help me, Mama.
IAN: Louise? Whoa!
Mom!
Mama!
Sorry, honey.
What day is it? Do you know, baby?
Sunday.
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?
Oh, Hannah, honey, your daddy didn't leave you.
You're gonna see him this weekend.
He doesn't look at me the same way anymore.
(SIGHING)
It's my fault.
I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.
What?
Well...
Believe it or not,
I know something that's going to happen.
I can't explain how I know. I just do.
And when I told your daddy, he got really mad.
And he said I made the wrong choice.
What? What's going to happen?
It has to do with a really rare disease.
And it's unstoppable.
Kind of like you are, with your swimming and your poetry and all the other amazing things that you share with the world.
I'm unstoppable?
Yeah.
(SOBBING)
IAN: I got you.
(GRUNTING)
Louise? Louise?
I just realized why my husband left me.
My husband left me.
You were married?
Come on! Let's get out of here.
(CROWD SCREAMING)
Mama?
LOUISE: Yeah?
Why's my name Hannah?
(ALARM SOUNDING)
MAN: Get those people back, please.
LOUISE:
Well, your name is very special, because it is a palindrome.
It reads the same forward and backward.
HALPERN: All right, guys, give me a hand here.
MAN: Yes, sir.
That goes in the bag.
MAN: Ready to go!
WOMAN: (ON PA)
Evacuation underway.
IAN: Hey...
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.
I can read it.
I know what it is.
What?
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.
The weapon is their language.
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.
If you learn it, when you really learn it, you begin to perceive time the way that they do, so you can see what's to come.
But time, it isn't the same for them.
It's non-linear.
Look, we did our best, but it wasn't enough.
The captain will load you up.
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.
Ian, Louise, it was an honor to work with you.
Good luck.
Hey, Colonel...
I'm gonna find out where we're going.
(WHISPERING) Wake up, Mommy!
Dr. Banks...
A pleasure.
General Shang, the pleasure is mine, really.
Your president said he was honored to host me at the celebration...
Yeah.
...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.
18 months ago, you did something remarkable, something not even my superior has done.
And what's that?
You changed my mind.
You're the reason for this unification, all because you reached out to me at my private number.
Your private number?
General, I... I don't know your private number.
Now you know.
I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I believe it was important for you to see that.
I called you, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
(SIGHING) Louise!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
HALPERN: All right, let's shut down the system.
Sir? There's a sat line here dialing China.
Here? What do you mean "here"?
Come on, come on!
Whose phone is it?
It's your phone, sir.
Search base camp now.
Find out who's using that phone.
And hold on to those coordinates.
Yes, sir.
LOUISE: Come on... What do I say?
What do I say?
Come on.
I will never forget what you said.
(SHANG SPEAKING MANDARIN
ON SATLINE)
You told me my wife's dying words.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(SHANG SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
SOLDIER: We found the source of the phone call.
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting for instructions.
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Changing someone's mind.
Can you buy me 20 seconds?
We don't have time for this.
No, trust me. Buy me 20 seconds.
Do you trust me?
Okay. Yeah.
(LOUISE SPEAKING MANDARIN)
Dr. Banks, drop the phone now or we shoot!
Drop it!
I'm sorry!
(CONTINUES SPEAKING MANDARIN)
HALPERN: You are committing an act of treason!
Yes.
Drop it!
It's done. I'm done.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
...blackout from all 12 landing sites continues this evening.
Hold on, we are just hearing...
I'm being told we're going to cut this report to tell you breaking news...
...China has called an emergency press conference...
General Shang, commander in chief of the People's Liberation Army, has announced in an emergency press conference that China is standing down.
...all intelligence they've received will be shared immediately with the other landing sites.
Scientists from around the world are sifting through information received from the UK, Japan,
Sierra Leone and Venezuela.
...the information they have acquired from both of their landing sites...
Also confirming it to be one of the 12 pieces of this puzzle that is being slowly put together.
LOUISE: So, Hannah, this is where your story begins.
The day they departed.
You al I rig ht?
Despite knowing the journey and where it leads,
I embrace it.
And I welcome every moment of it.
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!
(COOING)
BOTH: H-A-N-N-A-H.
(KNOCKING)
LOUISE: Now backward. H...
BOTH:...A-N-N-A-H!
Hannah!
IAN: You ready, baby?
Hi!
(WHISPERING, INDISTINCT)
Don't worry. See you.
Daddy!
You okay?
(GROWLING PLAYFULLY)
Are you ready?
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!
LOUISE: Ian?
IAN: Yeah?
LOUISE: If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?
IAN: Maybe I'd say what I feel more often.
I... I don't know.
You know, I've had my head tilted up to the stars for as long as I can remember.
You know what surprised me the most?
It wasn't meeting them.
It was meeting you.
I forgot how good it felt to be held by you.
IAN: You wanna make a baby?
LOUISE: Yes. Yeah.
