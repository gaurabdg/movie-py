1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,575
Now, remember,
keep your shoulders back.

2
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,212
Okay, put your arm around your brother.
That's it.

3
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,298
Right, and freeze.

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,975
Okay, one more.

5
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,728
Now, just to review,

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,314
you're going to follow along
the procession

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,195
until you get to the headmaster.

8
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,530
And at that point, he will indicate to you
to light the candles of the boys.

9
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,444
- All right.
- All right, boys, let's settle down.

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Banners up.

11
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:27,721
Ladies and gentlemen, boys,
the light of knowledge.

12
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,706
One hundred years ago, in 1859,

13
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:54,122
41 boys sat in this room
and were asked the same question

14
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,424
that now greets you
at the start of each semester.

15
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,336
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

16
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,560
Tradition, honor,
discipline, excellence.

17
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:16,064
In her first year,
Welton Academy graduated five students.

18
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,066
Last year, we graduated 51.

19
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:25,073
And more than 75 percent of those
went on to the Ivy League.

20
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,290
This kind of accomplishment

21
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:36,251
is the result of fervent dedication
to the principles taught here.

22
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,464
This is why you parents
have been sending us your sons.

23
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,720
This is why we are the best
preparatory school in the United States.

24
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,396
As you know,

25
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,062
our beloved Mr. Portius
of the English Department

26
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,356
retired last term.

27
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,491
You will have the opportunity later
to meet his replacement,

28
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,948
Mr. John Keating,

29
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,705
himself an honors graduate
of this school.

30
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,958
And who, for the past several years,

31
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,503
has been teaching at the highly regarded
Chester School in London.

32
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,680
- Richard, you forgot your bag.
- Hi, Charlie. Hey, how you doing?

33
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,387
- Don't worry,
I've got your club assignment.

34
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,736
I'm glad you could come by.

35
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,161
- Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan.
- You've been away too long.

36
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,821
- Hello, Dr. Nolan.
- How've you been?

37
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,115
- This is our youngest, Todd.
- Mr. Anderson.

38
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,200
You have some big shoes to fill,
young man.

39
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,834
Your brother was one of our finest.

40
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,125
Thank you.

41
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,087
- Lovely ceremony.
- Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it.

42
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,376
- Gale.
- John.

43
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,589
Good to see you again.

44
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,504
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.
- Neil.

45
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,513
We expect great things from you
this year.

46
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,800
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, he won't disappoint us.

47
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,640
- Right, Neil?
- I'll do my best, sir.

48
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,524
- Come on, son. No tears, now.
- Chin up. Chin up.

49
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,434
- I don't want to go here.
- I love you.

50
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,444
I'll walk you over.

51
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,567
Do your lessons.

52
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,822
Hey. I hear we're gonna be roommates.

53
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,832
- I'm Neil Perry.
- I'm Todd Anderson.

54
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,627
- Why'd you leave Balincrest?
- My brother went here.

55
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,754
Oh, so you're that Anderson.

56
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,083
Well, this is in case of his sinuses.

57
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,219
And, oh, if he can't swallow,
you give him one of these.

58
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,005
And if he has trouble breathing,
you can give him some of those.

59
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,218
- Fine, yes.
- Ooh.

60
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,850
- Did you remember your vaporizer?
- Yeah, it's in my room.

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,192
- Hey, how's it going, Neil?
- Hey, Knox.

62
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,650
- Neil. Study group tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

63
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,197
Business as usual, huh?

64
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,076
Hey, I heard you got the new kid.
Looks like a stiff. Ha, ha.

65
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,781
Oops.

66
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,950
Listen, don't mind Cameron.

67
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,746
He's born with his foot in his mouth.
You know what I mean?

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,963
Rumor has it you did summer school.

69
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,888
Yep. Chemistry.
My father thought I should get ahead.

70
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,095
- How was your summer, Slick?
- Keen.

71
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,102
- Meeks, door, closed.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,517
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

73
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:48,940
Travesty, horror, decadence, excrement.

74
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,240
Okay. Study group.

75
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,027
Meeks aced Latin,
I didn't quite flunk English.

76
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,412
So if you want, we got our study group.

77
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,871
Sure, Cameron asked me too.
Anyone mind including him?

78
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,001
What's his specialty, bootlicking?

79
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,335
- He's your roommate.
- That's not my fault.

80
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,631
- Uh, I'm sorry. My name is Steven Meeks.
- Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

81
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,386
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,637
Charlie Dalton.

83
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,345
- I'm Knox Overstreet.
- Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

84
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,888
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Well.

85
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,433
Valedictorian. National Merit scholar.

86
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,650
Oh, well. Welcome to Hell-ton.

87
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,156
It's every bit as tough as they say,
unless you're a genius like Meeks.

88
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,943
He flatters me.
That's why I help him with Latin.

89
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,827
And English, and trig.

90
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,166
It's open.

91
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,205
Father, I thought you'd gone.

92
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,999
- Mr. Perry, sir.
- Keep your seats, fellas.

93
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,885
Neil, I've just spoken to Mr. Nolan.

94
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,219
I think that you're taking too many
extracurricular activities this semester,

95
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,476
and I've decided
that you should drop the school annual.

96
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,979
- But I'm the assistant editor this year.
- Well, I'm sorry, Neil.

97
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,477
But, father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

98
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,860
Fellas, could you excuse us
for a moment?

99
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,874
- Don't you ever dispute me in public.
- Father, I wasn't...

100
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,502
After you've finished medical school
and you're on your own,

101
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,086
then you can do as you damn well please,
but until then, you do as I tell you.

102
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,377
- That clear?
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

103
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,056
Ahem. You know how much this means
to your mother, don't you?

104
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,682
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,888
You know me,
always taking on too much.

106
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,022
Well, that's my boy.

107
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,730
Now, listen, you need anything,
you let us know, huh?

108
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,405
Why doesn't he let you
do what you want?

110
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,501
Yeah, Neil. Tell him off.
It couldn't get any worse.

111
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,878
Oh, that's rich.
Like you guys tell your parents off?

112
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,005
Mr. Future-Lawyer
and Mr. Future-Banker.

113
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,167
Okay, so I don't like it
any more than you do.

114
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,469
Don't tell me how to talk to my father.
You guys are the same.

115
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,470
All right, all right. Jesus.

116
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,506
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to do.

117
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,342
Drop the annual.

118
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,135
I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.

119
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,687
It's just a bunch of jerks
trying to impress Nolan.

120
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,391
I don't care.
I don't give a damn about any of it.

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,818
Well, uh, Latin?
Eight o'clock in my room?

122
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,150
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

123
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,907
- Todd, you're welcome to join us.
- Yeah, come along, pal.

124
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,568
Thanks.

125
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,196
McAllister:
Slow down, boys.

126
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,862
Slow down,
you horrible phalanx of pubescence.

127
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,283
Pick three laboratory experiments
from the project list

128
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,170
and report on them every five weeks.

129
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,209
The first 20 questions
at the end of Chapter 1 are due tomorrow.

130
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,064
Again, please.

131
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:03,823
Your study of trigonometry
requires absolute precision.

132
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,790
Anyone failing to turn in
any homework assignment

133
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,000
will be penalized one point
off their final grade.

134
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,507
Let me urge you now
not to test me on this point.

135
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,267
Hey, Spaz. Spaz.

136
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,687
- Brain damage.
- Shh.

137
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,668
Well, come on.

138
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,629
- Is he kidding?
- He's gotta be.

139
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,468
- Let's go.
- Where?

140
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,258
Let's go, guys.

141
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,598
Okay, go.

142
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,627
<i>O Captain! my Captain!</i>

143
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,589
Who knows where that comes from?

144
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,708
Anybody?

145
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,093
Not a clue?

146
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,514
It's from a poem by Walt Whitman
about Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

147
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,522
Now, in this class,
you can either call me Mr. Keating,

148
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,480
or if you're slightly more daring,
O Captain, My Captain.

149
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,483
Now, let me dispel a few rumors
so they don't fester into facts.

150
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,245
Yes, I too attended Hell-ton
and survived.

151
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,624
And no, at that time, I was not
the mental giant you see before you.

152
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,252
I was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98-pound weakling.

153
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,458
I would go to the beach

154
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,044
and people would kick
copies of Byron in my face.

155
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,511
Now,

156
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,841
Mr. Pitts.

157
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,514
That's a rather unfortunate name.
Mr. Pitts, where are you?

158
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,272
Mr. Pitts, will you open your hymnal
to page 542?

159
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,233
Read the first stanza
of the poem you find there.

160
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,442
"To the Virgins,
To Make Much of Time"?

161
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,110
Yes, that's the one.

162
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,785
Somewhat appropriate, isn't it?

163
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,211
<i>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may</i>
Old time is still a-flying:

164
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,714
<i>And this same flower that smiles to-day</i>
To-morrow will be dying.

165
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,500
Thank you, Mr. Pitts.

166
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,513
<i>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may</i>

167
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,175
The Latin term for that sentiment
is carpe diem.

168
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,265
Now, who knows what that means?

169
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,105
Carpe diem, that's "seize the day."

170
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,979
- Very good, Mr.?
- Meeks.

171
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,236
Meeks. Another unusual name.

172
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,981
Seize the day.

173
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,151
<i>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may</i>

174
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,079
- Why does the writer use these lines?
- Because he's in a hurry.

175
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,656
No. Ding.

176
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,037
Thanks for playing anyway.

177
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,498
Because we are food for worms, lads.

178
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,134
Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room

179
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,968
is one day going to stop breathing,
turn cold and die.

180
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,810
I would like you
to step forward over here

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,096
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.

182
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,935
You've walked past them many times,

183
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,351
but I don't think
you've really looked at them.

184
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,867
They're not that different from you,
are they?

185
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,653
Same haircuts.

186
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,831
Full of hormones, just like you.

187
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,330
Invincible, just like you feel.

188
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,461
The world is their oyster.

189
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,544
They believe they're destined
for great things, just like many of you.

190
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,127
Their eyes are full of hope, just like you.

191
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,762
Did they wait until it was too late
to make from their lives

192
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,174
even one iota
of what they were capable?

193
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,938
Because, you see, gentlemen,
these boys are now fertilizing daffodils.

194
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,684
But if you listen real close,

195
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,525
you can hear them
whisper their legacy to you.

196
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,240
Go on, lean in.

197
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,368
Listen. You hear it?

198
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,370
Carpe...

199
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,715
Hear it?

200
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,551
Carpe...

201
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,639
Carpe diem.

202
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,395
Seize the day, boys.

203
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,354
Make your lives extraordinary.

204
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,121
- That was weird.
- But different.

205
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,006
Spooky, if you ask me.

206
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,883
Think he'll test us on that stuff?

207
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,262
Oh, come on, Cameron.
Don't you get anything?

208
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,139
What? What?

209
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,554
Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you, Dalton.

210
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,393
Who's up for a trig study group tonight?

211
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,647
- Sure.
- Me.

212
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,774
- What?
- I can't make it, guys.

213
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,688
I have to have dinner
at the Danburrys' house tonight.

214
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,355
The Danburrys?
Who are the Danburrys?

215
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,365
Big alums. How'd you swing that?

216
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,619
Friends of my dad's. They're
probably in their 90s or something.

217
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,824
Sounds great, doesn't it?

218
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,863
Anything's better
than Hell-ton hash, Knox.

219
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,909
- I'll second that.
- Yeah, we'll see.

220
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,420
Hey. Coming to the study group tonight?

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,549
Uh, no. No, I've got some history
I want to do.

222
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,459
Suit yourself.

223
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,080
Ready, Overstreet?

224
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,545
Ready to go, sir.

225
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,285
Chet, can you get that?

226
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,492
- Can't, Mom.
- I'll get it.

227
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,002
Can I help you?

228
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,504
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh...

229
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,385
- Dr. Hager.
- Hi.

230
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,299
- This is the Danburrys', right?
- Are you here to see Chet?

231
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,051
- Mrs. Danburry?
- No.

232
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,016
Sorry. Thank you, Chris.
I'm Mrs. Danburry.

233
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,018
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.

234
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,184
Back by 9? Please, come on in.

235
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,852
Chris, come on. What are you doing?

236
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,895
- Chet, I'm coming.
- Knox.

237
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,235
- How are you? Joe Danburry.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

238
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,616
Well, he's the spitting image
of his father, isn't he?

239
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,118
- How is he? Come on in.
- Chris.

240
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,949
He's great.
He just did a big case for GM.

241
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,863
- I know where you're headed.
- I'm coming.

242
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,282
Like father, like son, huh?

243
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,249
- Yes.
- Bishop to queen six.

244
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,130
- All right, I think that's good.
- Another game?

245
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,301
Just replace these numbers here
with X... For X and Y.

246
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,134
- Of course.
- Of course, so, what's the problem?

247
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,683
Do you think I can get in there?
You've been hogging it all day.

248
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,848
How was dinner?

249
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,262
Huh?

250
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,563
How was dinner?

251
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,274
Terrible.

252
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,025
- Awful.
- Why? What happened?

253
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:10,032
Tonight I met the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen in my entire life.

254
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,458
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

255
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,584
She's practically engaged.

256
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,667
To Chet Danburry.

257
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,128
- The guy could eat a football.
- Too bad.

258
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,760
Too bad? It's worse than too bad, Pitts,
it's a tragedy.

259
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,388
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

260
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,966
All the good ones go for jerks,
you know that.

261
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,269
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out Problem 5.

262
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,058
I can't just forget her, Cameron.
And I certainly can't think about trig.

263
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,693
- We got it.
- Turn that up.

264
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,105
All right, gentlemen. Five minutes.

265
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,947
- Let's go.
- Did you see her naked?

266
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,406
Very funny, Dalton.

267
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:53,116
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
would it, Mr. Pitts?

268
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,956
No, sir. Science experiment.

269
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,084
Radar.

270
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,551
Gentlemen, open your texts
to Page 21 of the introduction.

271
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,013
Mr. Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,

272
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,303
entitled "Understanding Poetry"?

273
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,525
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

274
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,026
To fully understand poetry,

275
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,315
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,

276
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,903
then ask two questions.

277
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,693
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

278
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,363
And two:
How important is that objective?

279
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,998
Question one rates
the poem's perfection.

280
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,160
Question two rates its importance.

281
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,545
And once these questions
have been answered,

282
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,333
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

283
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,096
If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph,

284
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,928
and its importance
is plotted on the vertical,

285
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,636
then calculating
the total area of the poem

286
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,726
yields the measure of its greatness.

287
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,692
A sonnet by Byron
might score high on the vertical,

288
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,778
but only average on the horizontal.

289
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,818
A Shakespearean sonnet,
on the other hand,

290
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,285
would score high
both horizontally and vertically,

291
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,287
yielding a massive total area,

292
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,665
thereby revealing the poem
to be truly great.

293
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,545
As you proceed through the poetry
in this book, practice this rating method.

294
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,303
As your ability to evaluate poems
in this manner grows,

295
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:34,467
so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry."

296
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,601
Excrement.

297
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,360
That's what I think
of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

298
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,610
We're not laying pipe.
We're talking about poetry.

299
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,950
How can you describe poetry
like <i>American Bandstand?</i>

300
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:56,205
"I like Byron.
I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it."

301
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,117
Now, I want you to rip out that page.

302
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,541
Go on. Rip out the entire page.

303
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,046
You heard me. Rip it out.

304
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,802
Rip it out.

305
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,509
Go on. Rip it out.

306
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,308
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

307
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,139
Tell you what, don't just tear out that
page, tear out the entire introduction.

308
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,270
I want it gone, history.
Leave nothing of it.

309
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,976
Rip it out. Rip.

310
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,692
Be gone, J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

311
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,945
Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out.

312
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,031
I want to hear
nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard.

313
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,161
We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

314
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,703
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.

315
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,999
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.

316
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,630
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Rip, rip, rip.

317
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,006
Rip it out. Rip.

318
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,223
Rip, rip.

319
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,010
Yeah.

320
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,061
Rip it out.

321
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,567
What the hell is going on here?

322
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,153
I don't hear enough rips.

323
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,488
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. McAllister.

324
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,576
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

325
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,581
I am.

326
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,499
Ah. So you are.

327
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,084
Excuse me.

328
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,754
Keep ripping, gentlemen.

329
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,553
This is a battle, a war.

330
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,756
And the casualties
could be your hearts and souls.

331
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,344
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

332
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,807
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

333
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,473
No. We'll not have that here.
No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

334
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,143
Now, in my class, you will learn
to think for yourselves again.

335
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,813
You will learn to savor
words and language.

336
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:59,370
No matter what anybody tells you,
words and ideas can change the world.

337
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,907
Now, I see that look in Mr. Pitts' eye,
like 19th-century literature

338
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,747
has nothing to do with going
to business school or medical school.

339
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,253
Right? Maybe.

340
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,255
Mr. Hopkins,
you may agree with him, thinking,

341
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,463
"Yes, we should simply
study our Mr. Pritchard

342
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,797
and learn our rhyme and meter

343
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:19,261
and go quietly about the business
of achieving other ambitions."

344
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,681
I have a little secret for you. Huddle up.

345
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,641
Huddle up.

346
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,148
We don't read and write poetry
because it's cute.

347
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,736
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

348
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:45,374
And the human race
is filled with passion.

349
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,336
And medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are noble pursuits,

350
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,497
and necessary to sustain life.

351
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:58,342
But poetry, beauty, romance, love,

352
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,881
these are what we stay alive for.

353
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,559
To quote from Whitman:

354
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,773
<i>O me! O life!</i>
Of the questions of these recurring;

355
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,103
<i>Of the endless trains of the faithless...</i>

356
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,484
<i>Of cities filled with the foolish;</i>

357
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,819
<i>What good amid these, O me, O life?</i>

358
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,403
<i>Answer.</i>

359
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,614
<i>That you are here...</i>

360
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,953
<i>That life exists, and identity;</i>

361
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,375
<i>That the powerful play goes on</i>
And you may contribute a verse.

362
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:39,554
<i>That the powerful play goes on</i>
And you may contribute a verse.

363
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,259
What will your verse be?

364
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:55,190
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

365
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,650
Amen.

366
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,915
Quite an interesting class
you gave today, Mr. Keating.

367
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,704
Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

368
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,089
There's no need to apologize.
It was very fascinating.

369
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,798
- Misguided though it was.
- You think so?

370
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,214
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists, John.

371
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:27,135
When they realize that they're not
Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

372
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,597
they'll hate you for it.

373
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,105
We're not talking artists, George,
we're talking free thinkers.

374
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,767
Free thinkers at 17?

375
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,727
Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

376
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,444
Not a cynic.

377
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,866
A realist.

378
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,285
<i>Show me the heart</i>
Unfettered by foolish dreams

379
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,323
<i>And I'll show you a happy man.</i>

380
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,127
<i>But only in their dreams</i>
Can men be truly free

381
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,131
<i>'Twas always thus</i>
And always thus will be.

382
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,173
- Tennyson?
- No, Keating.

383
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,891
Hey, I found his senior annual
in the library.

384
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,012
Listen to this:
Captain of the soccer team,

385
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,019
editor of the school annual,
Cambridge bound,

386
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,318
thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

387
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,112
"Man most likely to do anything."

388
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,575
Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

389
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,491
- What's the Dead Poets Society?
- Is there a picture?

390
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:33,750
- Nothing, no other mention of it.
- That boy there, see me after lunch.

391
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,755
Mr. Keating.

392
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,132
Mr. Keating.

393
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,295
Sir?

394
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,679
Say something.

395
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,089
O Captain, My Captain?

396
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,011
Gentlemen.

397
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,387
We were just looking in your old annual.

398
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,726
Oh, my God.

399
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,399
No, that's not me.

400
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,229
Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.

401
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,444
- God.
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

402
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,285
I doubt the present administration
would look too favorably upon that.

403
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,079
Why? What was it?

404
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,793
Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

405
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,966
Sure.

406
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,849
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

407
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,560
That's a phrase from Thoreau we would
invoke at the beginning of every meeting.

408
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,146
See, we would gather
at the old Indian cave

409
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,609
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley, the biggies.

410
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,485
Even some of our own verse.

411
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:50,240
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

412
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,492
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry?

413
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,917
No, Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just guys.

414
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,999
We weren't a Greek organization,
we were romantics.

415
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,963
And we didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.

416
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,128
Spirits soared, women swooned,

417
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,468
and gods were created, gentlemen.

418
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,257
Not a bad way to spend an evening, eh?

419
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,891
Thank you, Mr. Perry,
for this stroll down amnesia lane.

420
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,478
Burn that. Especially my picture.

421
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,112
- Dead Poets Society.
- What?

422
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,825
I say we go tonight.

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,080
- Tonight?
- Wait a minute.

424
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,663
- Everybody in?
- Where's this cave he's talking about?

425
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,577
It's beyond the stream.
I know where it is.

426
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,371
That's miles.

427
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,380
- Sounds boring to me.
- Don't go.

428
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,212
You know how many demerits
we're talking?

429
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,876
So don't come, please.

430
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,592
Look, all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.

431
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,633
- We can't get caught.
- No shit, Sherlock.

432
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,559
You boys there, hurry up.

433
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,561
All right. Who's in?

434
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,356
- Come on, Neil, Hager's there...
- Forget Hager. No.

435
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,187
Who's in?

436
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,151
I'm in.

437
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,152
I'm warning you. Move.

438
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,191
- Me too.
- I don't know, Neil.

439
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,610
What? Pitts.

440
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,660
- Pittsie, come on.
- His grades are hurting.

441
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,664
- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?

442
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,166
Forget it, you're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?

443
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,669
- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.

444
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,171
I'm in as long as we're careful.

445
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,628
- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.

446
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,885
Come on, Knox. It'll help you get Chris.

447
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,137
Yeah? How?

448
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,674
- Women swoon. Ha, ha, ha.
- But why do they swoon?

449
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,310
Charlie, tell me why they swoon.
Charlie.

450
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,722
You're not listening.

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,312
Look, you follow the stream
to the waterfall.

452
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,109
It's right there. It's got to be like...

453
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,440
I don't know, guys,
it's starting to sound dangerous.

454
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,778
- Well, why don't you stay home?
- You're crazy.

455
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,282
For God's sake,
stop chattering and sit down.

456
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,454
- Todd, are you coming tonight?
- No.

457
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,789
Why not? You were there.
You heard Keating.

458
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,458
Don't you want to
do something about...?

459
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,752
Yes, but, uh...

460
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,504
But what?

461
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,431
Keating said that
everybody took turns reading,

462
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,055
and I don't want to do that.

463
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,316
Gosh, you really have a problem
with that, don't you?

464
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,651
No, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just...

465
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,862
- I don't want to do it, okay?
- All right.

466
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,451
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?

467
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,536
- That's not how it works.
- Forget how it works.

468
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,748
What if they said it was okay?

469
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,498
What? What, are you gonna go up
and ask them if?

470
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,755
- No, no.
- I'll be right back.

471
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,669
Neil. Neil.

472
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,351
Oh, shut up, will you?

473
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,185
That's for my asthma, okay?
Could you give that back, please?

474
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,439
Could you give that back?

475
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,818
What's the matter?
Don't you like snakes?

476
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,649
- You're in.
- Get away from me, okay?

477
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,360
Spaz,
why don't you check your pockets?

478
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,234
Come on, Spaz.
I have to brush my teeth.

479
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,118
Hurry up, get off.

480
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,247
Cut out that racket in there.

481
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,537
Let's go.

482
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,165
Let's go, let's go, come on.

483
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,808
- Let's get out of here.
- Go. Shh.

484
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,493
- Yarr! I'm a dead poet.
- Jesus, Charlie.

485
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,373
- Guys, over here. Ha, ha, ha.
- You're funny. You're real funny.

486
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,866
It's too wet.

487
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,831
God,
you trying to smoke us out of here?

488
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,916
No, the smoke's
going right up this opening.

489
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,342
- You okay?
- Arghh.

490
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,799
- Oh, God.
- Clod.

491
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,715
- All right, all right, forget the fire.
- Forget it, forget it.

492
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,976
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- It's like trying to light a swamp.

493
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,309
I hereby reconvene
the Dead Poets Society.

494
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,223
Yay.

495
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,482
Welton Chapter.

496
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,359
The meetings will be conducted
by myself

497
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,691
and the other new initiates now present.

498
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,696
Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read,

499
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,241
will keep minutes of the meetings.

500
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,284
I'll now read
the traditional opening message

501
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,367
by society member
Henry David Thoreau.

502
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,533
"I went to the woods
because I wanted to live deliberately.

503
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,169
I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."

504
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,837
I'll second that.

505
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,422
"To put to rout all that was not life,

506
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,802
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived."

507
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,008
And Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.

508
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,426
All right, intermission.

509
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,728
Dig deep, right here.
Right here, lay it down.

510
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,854
On the mud?
We're gonna put our food on the mud?

511
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,149
Meeks, put your coat down.
Picnic blanket.

512
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,068
- Use Meeks' coat.
- "Use Meeks' coat."

513
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,025
Don't keep anything back, either.

514
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,155
You guys are always
bumming my smokes.

515
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,907
- Raisins?
- Yeah.

516
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,113
Wait a minute.

517
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,075
- Who gave us half a roll?
- I'm eating the other half.

518
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,082
- Come on.
- What, you want me to put it back?

519
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,000
It was a dark and rainy night.

520
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,538
And this old lady
who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles

521
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:44,130
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

522
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:49,010
As she pieced the puzzle together,
she realized to her astonishment

523
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,642
that the image that was formed
was her very own room,

524
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,350
and the figure in the center
of the puzzle, as she completed it,

525
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,604
was herself.

526
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,935
And with trembling hands,
she placed the last four pieces

527
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,899
and stared in horror

528
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,237
at the face of a demented madman
at the window.

529
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,652
The last thing
that this old lady ever heard

530
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,071
was the sound of breaking glass.

531
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,705
- No shit.
- Yes.

532
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,992
This is true. This is true.

533
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,627
I've got one
that's even better than that.

534
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,663
I do. There's a young married couple,

535
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,503
and they're driving through the forest
at night from a long trip.

536
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,417
They run out of gas,
and there's a madman...

537
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,258
- That thing with the hands?
- And he cuts her husband's head off?

538
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,343
- I love that story.
- I told you that one.

539
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,050
You did not.
I got that in, uh, camp in sixth grade.

540
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:38,689
<i>In a mean abode in the Shanking road</i>
Lived a man named William Bloat;

541
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,019
<i>Now, he had a wife</i>
The plague of his life

542
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,150
<i>Who continually got his goat.</i>

543
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,653
<i>And one day at dawn</i>
With her night shift on

544
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,860
<i>He slit her bloody throat.</i>

545
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,035
- Oh, and it gets worse.
- You want to hear a real poem?

546
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,579
- Want this?
- No, I don't need it. Get this out of here.

547
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,489
- Did you bring one?
- You memorized a poem?

548
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,954
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

549
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,665
- An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
- An original piece.

550
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,081
- Take center stage.
- You know this is history, right?

551
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,465
This is history.

552
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,466
Where did you get that?

553
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:24,192
<i>Teach me to love?</i>
Go teach thy self more wit;

554
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,444
<i>I chief Professor am of it.</i>

555
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,323
<i>The God of Love</i>
If such a thing there be

556
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,950
<i>May learn to love from me.</i>

557
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,863
Wow. Did you write that?

558
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,951
Abraham Cowley.

559
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,957
Okay, who's next?

560
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,505
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

561
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,883
<i>Come, my friends</i>

562
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,920
<i>'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</i>

563
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,431
<i>For my purpose holds</i>
To sail beyond the sunset.

564
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,933
<i>And though we are not now</i>

565
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:01,563
<i>That strength which in old days</i>
Moved earth and heaven;

566
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,815
<i>That which we are, we are</i>

567
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:08,194
<i>One equal temper of heroic hearts</i>

568
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,027
<i>Made weak by time and fate</i>
But strong in will

569
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,444
<i>To strive, to seek, to find</i>

570
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,698
<i>And not to yield.</i>

571
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,334
<i>Then I had religion</i>
And then I had a vision.

572
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,870
<i>I could not turn</i>
From their revel in derision.

573
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,631
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

574
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,463
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

575
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,091
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

576
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,677
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

577
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,308
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

578
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,970
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

579
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,556
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

580
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,020
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

581
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,607
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

582
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,363
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

583
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,566
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

584
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,030
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

585
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,412
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

586
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,914
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

587
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,417
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
Creeping through the black

588
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,919
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

589
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,376
Take it, Meeks. Take it away.

590
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,836
<i>Cutting through the forest</i>
With a golden track.

591
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,673
<i>Then I saw the Congo</i>
creeping through the black

592
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,101
A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.

593
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,439
And don't use "very sad," use...
Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp.

594
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,105
- Morose?
- Exactly, morose.

595
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,320
Now, language was developed
for one endeavor, and that is?

596
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,079
Mr. Anderson? Come on,
are you a man or an amoeba?

597
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,834
Mr. Perry?

598
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,382
- To communicate.
- No. To woo women.

599
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,045
Today we're gonna be talking
about William Shakespeare.

600
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,635
- Oh, God.
- I know.

601
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,140
A lot of you look forward to this

602
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,767
about as much as you look forward
to root canal work.

603
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,348
We're gonna talk about Shakespeare

604
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,014
as someone who writes
something very interesting.

605
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,772
Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:

606
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,279
O, Titus, bring your friend hither.

607
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,066
But if any of you
have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,

608
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,610
you know Shakespeare can be different.

609
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:26,033
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

610
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,204
You can also
imagine John Wayne as Macbeth going:

611
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,839
"Well, is this a dagger I see before me?"

612
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,423
"Dogs, sir?"

613
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,838
"Oh, not just now."

614
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,429
"I do enjoy a good dog
once in a while, sir.

615
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,222
You can have yourself
a three-course meal from one dog.

616
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,141
Start with your canine crudités,

617
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,939
go to your Fido flambé for main course,
and for dessert, a Pekingese parfait.

618
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,027
And you can pick your teeth
with a little paw."

619
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,695
Why do I stand up here? Anybody?

620
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,205
- To feel taller.
- No.

621
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,329
Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton.

622
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,790
I stand upon my desk to remind myself

623
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:16,003
that we must constantly look at things
in a different way.

624
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,261
You see, the world looks very different
from up here.

625
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,515
You don't believe me?

626
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,436
Come see for yourselves. Come on.

627
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,604
Come on.

628
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,686
Just when you think
you know something,

629
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,441
you have to look at it in another way.

630
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,151
Even though it may seem silly or wrong,
you must try.

631
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,907
I stand upon my desk to remind myself

632
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,239
Consider what you think.

633
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:49,495
Boys, you must strive
to find your own voice.

634
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,833
Because the longer you wait to begin,
the less likely you are to find it at all.

635
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,256
Thoreau said,
"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."

636
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,839
Don't be resigned to that. Break out.

637
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,259
Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings,
look around you.

638
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,848
There. There you go, Mr. Priske.
Thank you, yes.

639
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,690
Dare to strike out and find new ground.

640
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,150
Now, in addition to your essays,

641
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,529
I would like you to compose a poem
of your own. An original work.

642
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,573
That's right.

643
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:31,161
You have to deliver it aloud
in front of the class on Monday.

644
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,496
<i>Bonne chance,</i> gentlemen.

645
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,537
Mr. Anderson?

646
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,418
Don't think that I don't know

647
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,710
that this assignment
scares the hell out of you, you mole.

648
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,725
Take a power train in two.

649
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,770
Three.

650
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,781
- Keep your eyes in the boat.
- Stroke.

651
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,111
- Quick, captain.
- Let's go.

652
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,318
We got it, Pittsie, we got it.

653
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,828
Radio Free America.

654
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,885
Let's do it again.

655
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,483
- I found it.
- You found what?

656
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,899
What I want to do right now.
What's really, really inside of me.

657
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,234
- <i>"A Midsummer Night's Dream"?</i>
- This is it.

658
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,403
- What is that?
- It's a play, dummy.

659
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,789
I know that.
What does it have to do with you?

660
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,957
All right,
they're putting it on at Henley Hall.

661
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,335
Open tryouts. Open tryouts.

662
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,333
- Yes, so?
- So...

663
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:02,964
I'm gonna act.

664
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,925
Aha!

665
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,424
Yes, yes, I'm gonna be an actor.

666
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,680
Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this.

667
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,091
I even tried to go to summer stock
auditions last year,

668
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,226
but, of course,
my father wouldn't let me.

669
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,434
For the first time in my whole life,
I know what I want to do.

670
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,020
And for the first time, I'm gonna do it!

671
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,854
Whether my father wants me to or not.
Carpe diem!

672
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,404
Neil, Neil, hold on.

673
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,907
How are you gonna be in a play
if your father won't let you?

674
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,702
First, I gotta get the part,
then I can worry about that.

675
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,035
Won't he kill you if he finds out
you went to an audition and didn't tell him?

676
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,042
No. As far as I'm concerned,
he won't have to know about any of this.

677
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,828
- That's impossible.
- Bullshit, nothing's impossible.

678
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,544
Why don't you just call him and ask him?
Maybe he'll say yes.

679
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,128
That's a laugh.

680
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,963
If I don't ask him,
at least I won't be disobeying him.

681
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,679
- Yeah, but if he said no...
- Jesus, Todd, whose side are you on?

682
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,605
I mean,
I haven't even gotten the part yet.

683
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,984
Can't I even enjoy the idea
for a little while?

684
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,541
You're coming to the meeting
this afternoon?

685
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,876
I don't know. Maybe.

686
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:29,135
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say
means shit to you, does it, Todd?

687
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,758
- What does that mean?
- You're in the club.

688
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,639
Being in the club means
being stirred up by things.

689
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,641
You look about as stirred up
as a cesspool.

690
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,303
- So you want me out?
- No, I want you in.

691
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,268
But being in means
you gotta do something,

692
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,522
not just say you're in.

693
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,275
Well, listen, Neil.

694
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:49,610
I appreciate this concern,
but I'm not like you, all right?

695
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,407
You say things and people listen.

696
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,160
- I'm not like that.
- Don't you think you could be?

697
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,946
No. I...

698
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,077
I don't know, but that's not the point.

699
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,663
The point is that there's nothing
you can do about it.

700
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,625
So you can just butt out.
I can take care of myself just fine.

701
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,672
All right?

702
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,844
No.

703
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,723
What do you mean, no?

704
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,891
No.

705
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,432
- Give me... Neil, give that back.
- What is this? "We are dreaming of a..."

706
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,443
What it this? Poetry.
I'm being chased by Walt Whitman.

707
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,105
Okay, okay.

708
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,116
What are you guys doing?
I'm trying... You see this chemistry...?

709
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,403
Hey, give me... Neil, give me...
Don't be immature.

710
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,492
Come on, I need my...

711
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,157
Give it to me. Give it to me.

712
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,576
Charlie, help me.

713
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,870
Grab that book. I need...

714
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,170
Whoo.

715
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,026
Whoo!

716
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,384
Okay, everybody on the bus.

717
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,556
Let's go, boys.

718
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,889
Come on, let's go.
On the bus, boys, now.

719
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,435
Now, devotees may argue
that one sport or game

720
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,275
is inherently better than another.

721
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,940
For me,
sport is actually a chance for us

722
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,201
to have other human beings
push us to excel.

723
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,864
I want you all to come over here
and take a slip of paper

724
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,416
and line up single file.

725
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,369
Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.

726
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,836
Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

727
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,467
I want you to hand these out to the boys,
one apiece.

728
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,968
You know what to do, Pitts.

729
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,475
<i>O to struggle against great odds</i>
To meet enemies undaunted.

730
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,479
Sounds to me like you're
daunted. Say it like you're undaunted.

731
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,686
<i>O to struggle against great odds</i>
To meet enemies undaunted.

732
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,691
Now, go on.

733
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,403
Yes. Next.

734
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,238
<i>To be a sailor of the world</i>
Bound for all ports.

735
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,987
Next. Louder.

736
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,873
<i>O while I live to be the ruler of life</i>
Not a slave.

737
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,243
<i>To mount the scaffolds</i>

738
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,504
<i>To advance to the muzzles of guns</i>
With perfect nonchalance!

739
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,969
Come on, Meeks. Listen to the music.

740
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:47,060
<i>To dance, clap hands, exult</i>
Shout, skip, roll on, float on!

741
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,844
Yes.

742
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:55,026
<i>O to have life henceforth</i>
A poem of new joys

743
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,857
Aw, pbbt. Boo.

744
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,239
Come on, Charlie, let it fill your soul.

745
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,780
<i>To indeed be a god.</i>

746
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:08,330
Charlie, I got the part. Rah!

747
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,491
I'm gonna play Puck.
I'm gonna play Puck.

748
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,079
- What did he say?
- Puck?

749
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,539
- The main part.
- Great, Neil.

750
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,749
Charlie, I got it.

751
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,165
- Congratulations.
- Good for you, Neil. Good for you.

752
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:21,252
Okay, okay, okay.

753
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,213
Neil, how are you gonna do this?

754
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,100
They need a letter of permission
from my father and Mr. Nolan.

755
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,057
- You're not gonna write it.
- Oh, yes, I am.

756
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,096
Oh, Neil, you're crazy.

757
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,354
Okay.

758
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,237
"I am writing to you

759
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:46,277
on behalf of my son,

760
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,868
Neil Perry."

761
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,120
This is great.

762
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,091
- "To Chris."
- Who's Chris?

763
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,972
Mmm. Chris.

764
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,347
<i>I see a sweetness in her smile.</i>

765
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,638
<i>Bright light shines from her eyes.</i>

766
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,776
<i>But life is complete</i>
Contentment is mine

767
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,231
<i>Just knowing that...</i>

768
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,739
<i>Just knowing that</i>

769
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,076
<i>She's alive.</i>

770
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,784
- Sorry, captain, it's stupid.
- No, no, it's not stupid.

771
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,323
It's a good effort.

772
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,992
It touched on
one of the major themes: love.

773
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,120
A major theme not only in poetry,
but life.

774
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,584
Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing.
You're up.

775
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,931
<i>The cat sat on the mat.</i>

776
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,354
Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins.

777
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,774
You have the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.

778
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,411
We're not laughing at you,
we're laughing near you.

779
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,575
I don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.

780
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,866
The most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things

781
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,706
like a cat, or a flower, or rain.

782
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,043
You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.

783
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,378
Just don't let your poems be ordinary.

784
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,512
Now, who's next?

785
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,138
Mr. Anderson,
I see you sitting there in agony.

786
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,311
Come on, Todd, step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.

787
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,232
I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem.

788
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,148
Mr. Anderson thinks
that everything inside of him

789
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,942
is worthless and embarrassing.

790
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,283
Isn't that right, Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?

791
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,115
Well, I think you're wrong.

792
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:42,206
I think you have something inside of you
that is worth a great deal.

793
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,213
"I sound

794
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,512
my barbaric

795
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,219
yawk

796
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:02,018
over the rooftops of the world."

797
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,937
W.W., Uncle Walt again.

798
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:12,654
Now, for those of you who don't know,
a yawp is a loud cry or yell.

799
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:17,071
Now, Todd, I would like you to give us
a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.

800
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:22,915
Come on, you can't yawp sitting down.
Let's go. Come on, up.

801
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,204
Gotta get in yawping stance.

802
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,626
- A yawp.
- No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.

803
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,919
Yeah, yeah, right.

804
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,089
- Yawp.
- Come on, louder.

805
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,427
- Yawp.
- Oh, that's a mouse.

806
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,467
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.

807
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,101
- God, boy, yell like a man.
- Yawp!

808
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,355
There it is. You see,
you have a barbarian in you after all.

809
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,858
Now, you don't get away that easy.
There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there.

810
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,442
What does he remind you of?
Don't think, answer. Go on.

811
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,152
- A madman.
- What kind of madman?

812
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,567
- Don't think about it, answer again.
- A crazy madman.

813
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,157
You can do better.
Free up your mind, use your imagination.

814
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,164
Say the first thing that pops into
your head, even if it's gibberish.

815
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,915
A sweaty-toothed madman.

816
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,667
Good God, boy,
there's a poet in you after all.

817
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,420
There, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close them.

818
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,378
Now describe what you see.

819
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,510
- I close my eyes.
- Yes?

820
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,422
- And this image floats beside me.
- A sweaty-toothed madman.

821
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,558
A sweaty-toothed madman
with a stare that pounds my brain.

822
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,390
oh, that's excellent. Now give him action.
Make him do something.

823
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,476
- His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. wonderful, wonderful.

824
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,892
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?

825
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,312
Mumbling truth. Truth, like a blanket
that always leaves your feet cold.

826
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,780
Forget them, forget them.
Stay with the blanket.

827
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,283
Tell me about that blanket.

828
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,069
You can push it, stretch it,
it'll never be enough.

829
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,784
You kick at it, beat it,
it'll never cover any of us.

830
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,792
From the moment we enter crying
to the moment we leave dying,

831
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:49,752
it'll just cover your face
as you wail and cry and scream.

832
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

833
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,136
Don't you forget this.

834
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:07,040
- Atta boy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.
- My dad collects a lot of pipes.

835
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,164
- Really? Mine's got 30.
- Your parents collect pipes?

836
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,169
Oh, that's really interesting.

837
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,336
Come on, Knox. Join in.

838
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,341
We're from the government.
We're here to help.

839
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,753
- What's wrong?
- It's Chris.

840
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:23,640
- Here's a picture of Chris for you.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

841
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,596
- That's not funny.
- Knock it off.

842
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,352
- Smoke your pipes.
- Okay.

843
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,887
Neil.

844
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,229
Friends, scholars, Welton men.

845
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,693
- What is that, Neil?
- Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

846
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,947
No, this is the god of the cave.

847
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,197
The god of the cave?

848
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,823
Charlie, what are you doing?

849
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,613
What do you say we start this meeting?

850
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,202
Yeah, just... I need a light.

851
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,788
- Who's got a light?
- Did you bring the earplugs?

852
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,790
Gentlemen, "Poetrusic,"
by Charles Dalton.

853
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,753
- Oh, boy.
- He's gonna play.

854
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,507
Oh, no.

855
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,297
<i>Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.</i>

856
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,309
<i>Gotta do more. Gotta be more.</i>

857
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:15,355
<i>Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming</i>
Gotta do more, gotta be more.

858
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,346
Wow.

859
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,886
- That was nice.
- That was great.

860
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,679
Where did you learn to play like that?

861
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,770
My parents made me take the clarinet
for years.

862
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:58,026
- I love the clarinet.
- I hated it.

863
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,271
The saxophone.

864
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:05,192
The saxophone is more sonorous.

865
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,652
Ooh.

866
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,616
- Vocabulary.
- Look at him.

867
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,908
I can't take it anymore. If I don't
have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.

868
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,872
Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.

869
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,957
No, Charlie.

870
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:21,292
That's just my problem.
I've been calm all my life.

871
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,755
- I'm gonna do something about that.
- Where you going?

872
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,597
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna call her. Yeah.

873
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,479
<i>Hello?</i>

874
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,607
She's gonna hate me.

875
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,645
The Danburrys will hate me.

876
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,573
My parents will kill me.

877
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,406
All right, goddamn it.

878
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:56,168
You're right. Carpe diem.

879
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,620
Even if it kills me.

880
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,846
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Chris?

881
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:12,635
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hi, this is Knox Overstreet.

882
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,972
<i>Oh, yes, Knox. Glad you called.</i>

883
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,265
She's glad I called.

884
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,942
<i>Listen, Chet's parents</i>
are going out of town this weekend

885
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,272
<i>and he's having a party.</i>

886
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,904
- <i>Would you like to come?</i>
- Would I like to come to a party?

887
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,781
- Yes. Say yes.
- <i>Friday?</i>

888
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,112
- Well, sure.
- <i>About 7?</i>

889
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,117
- Okay, great. I'll be there, Chris.
- <i>Okay.</i>

890
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,824
Friday night at the Danburrys.

891
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,454
- Okay, thank you.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

892
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,741
Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

893
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,294
Yawp!

894
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,413
Can you believe it?

895
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,253
She was gonna call me.

896
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,759
She invited me to a party with her.

897
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,637
- At Chet Danburry's house?
- Yeah.

898
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,220
- Well?
- So?

899
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,932
So you don't really think
she means you're going with her?

900
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,436
Well, of course not, Charlie,
but that's not the point.

901
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,319
- That's not the point at all.
- What is the point?

902
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:09,241
The point, Charlie,

903
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,406
is, uh...

904
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,831
- Yeah?
...that she was thinking about me.

905
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:22,455
I've only met her once, and already,
she's thinking about me.

906
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,294
Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys.

907
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,424
I feel it.

908
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:32,260
She is going to be mine.

909
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,052
Carpe. Carpe.

910
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:43,024
No grades at stake, gentlemen.
Just take a stroll.

911
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,399
There it is.

912
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,331
<i>I don't know, but I've been told</i>

913
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,245
<i>I don't know, but I've been told</i>

914
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,164
<i>Doing poetry is old</i>

915
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,628
<i>Doing poetry is old</i>

916
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:14,765
Left, left, left, right, left.

917
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,424
Left, halt.

918
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,139
Thank you, gentlemen.

919
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:24,061
If you noticed, everyone started off
with their own stride, their own pace.

920
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,521
Mr. Pitts, taking his time.

921
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,482
He knew he'll get there one day.

922
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,271
Mr. Cameron,
you could see him thinking,

923
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,034
"Is this right? It might be right.
I know that... Maybe not. I don't know."

924
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,617
Mr. Overstreet's, driven by deeper force.

925
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,907
Yes, we know that.

926
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,622
All right, now, I didn't bring them up here
to ridicule them.

927
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,287
I brought them up here
to illustrate the point of conformity.

928
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,923
The difficulty in maintaining
your own beliefs in the face of others.

929
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,210
Now, those of you,
I see the look in your eyes like,

930
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,470
"I would have walked differently."

931
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,302
Well, ask yourselves
why you were clapping.

932
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,601
Now, we all have a great need
for acceptance.

933
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,558
But you must trust
that your beliefs are unique, your own.

934
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,144
Even though others
may think them odd or unpopular.

935
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,731
Even though the herd may go,
"That's baa-d."

936
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,740
Robert Frost said,
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,

937
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,778
I took the one less travelled by,
and that has made all the difference."

938
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,413
Now, I want you to find your own walk
right now.

939
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,246
Your own way of striding, pacing.
Any direction, anything you want.

940
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,003
Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything.

941
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:30,753
Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.

942
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,925
You don't have to perform,
just make it for yourself.

943
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,809
Mr. Dalton, you be joining us?

944
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,140
Exercising the right not to walk.

945
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,565
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
You just illustrated the point.

946
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,101
Swim against the stream.

947
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,822
Todd?

948
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,743
- Hey.
- Hey.

949
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,833
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

950
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,093
- Today's my birthday.
- Is today your birthday?

951
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,170
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

952
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,055
- What'd you get?
- My parents gave me this.

953
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,350
Isn't this the same desk...?

954
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,557
Yeah, they gave me the same thing
as last year.

955
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,228
- Oh.
- Oh.

956
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,444
Maybe they thought
you needed another one.

957
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,024
Maybe they weren't thinking
about anything at all.

958
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,539
The funny thing is about this is,
I didn't even like it the first time.

959
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:50,670
Todd, I think you're underestimating
the value of this desk set.

960
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:57,965
I mean, who would want a football,
or a baseball, or...?

961
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,296
Or a car?

962
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:02,682
Or a car, if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one?

963
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,811
I mean, if I were ever going to buy
a desk set twice,

964
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,690
I would probably buy this one
both times.

965
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,233
In fact, its shape is...

966
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,074
It's rather aerodynamic, isn't it?

967
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,494
I can feel it.

968
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,287
Phew.

969
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,625
This desk set wants to fly.

970
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,878
Todd?

971
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:37,546
The world's first unmanned
flying desk set.

972
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,887
Whew. Ha, ha.

973
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,511
Oh, my.

974
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:47,177
Well, I wouldn't worry.

975
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,686
You'll get another one next year.

976
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,025
<i>To live deep</i>
And suck out all the marrow of life.

977
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,901
<i>To put to rout all that was not life.</i>

978
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,190
Oh, my God.

979
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,202
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this is it.

980
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:06,658
Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave.

981
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,664
- Watch your step.
- We're not gonna slip, are we?

982
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,200
Uh-oh.

983
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,122
Hi.

984
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,704
- Unh.
- Hello.

985
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,914
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.

986
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,004
Meet, uh, Gloria and...

987
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,759
- Tina.
- Tina.

988
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,839
This is the pledge class
of the Dead Poets Society.

989
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,382
- Hello.
- Hey, how do you do?

990
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

991
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,726
Guys, move, move.

992
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,683
Come on, folks, it's Friday night.
Let's get on with the meeting.

993
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:32,893
Excuse me.

994
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,898
CHRIS
<i>Hello?</i>

995
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,857
In keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets,

996
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,148
I'm giving up the name Charles Dalton.

997
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,863
From now on, call me Nuwanda.

998
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,444
- Nuwanda?
- Nuwanda?

999
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,490
Okay.

1000
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:02,093
Hello? Hello, Chris?

1001
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,176
- Knox.
- Hi.

1002
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,265
You made it, great.

1003
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,770
- Bring anybody?
- No.

1004
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,682
No? Ginny Danburry's here.

1005
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,020
Look, I have to go find Chet.

1006
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,436
Why don't you go downstairs?
That's where everybody is.

1007
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,195
- But, Chris...
- Make yourself at home.

1008
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,776
But I...

1009
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,338
Hey, guys.

1010
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:47,179
Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother?

1011
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,349
Bubba, this guy look like
Mutt Sanders to you, or what?

1012
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,511
You're his brother?

1013
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,847
No relation. Never heard of him.
Sorry, guys.

1014
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,060
Where's your manners?

1015
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,817
There's Mutt Sanders' brother,
we don't even offer him a drink.

1016
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,444
- Have some whisky, pal.
- Yeah.

1017
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,151
I don't really drink...

1018
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:07,112
- To Mutt.
- To Mutt.

1019
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,368
To Mutt.

1020
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,907
Now, how the hell is old Mutt anyway?

1021
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,996
Yeah, what's old Mutter
been up to, huh?

1022
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,371
I don't really know Mutt.

1023
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,340
- To the Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.

1024
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,547
To Mighty Mutt.

1025
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,513
Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy.

1026
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,770
Say hello to Mutt for me, okay?

1027
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,353
- Will do.
- Hell of a guy, your old brother, Mutt.

1028
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,945
Are we gonna have a meeting, or what?

1029
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,448
Yeah, if you guys don't have a meeting,
how do we know if we want to join?

1030
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,075
Join?

1031
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,329
<i>Shall I compare thee</i>
To a summer's day?

1032
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,990
<i>Thou art more lovely</i>
And more temperate.

1033
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,832
- That's so sweet.
- I made that up just for you.

1034
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,792
You did?

1035
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,007
I'll write one for you too, Gloria.

1036
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:11,092
<i>She walks in beauty like the night</i>

1037
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,726
<i>She walks in beauty like the night</i>

1038
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,601
<i>Of cloudless climes and starry skies</i>

1039
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,893
<i>All that's best of dark and bright</i>

1040
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,777
<i>Meet in her aspect and her eyes;</i>

1041
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,313
That's beautiful.

1042
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,446
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1043
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,821
God help me.

1044
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,217
Carpe diem.

1045
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,037
What, you don't remember?

1046
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,455
What, are you kidding?

1047
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,668
- Chet, Chet, look.
- What?

1048
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,219
It's Mutt Sanders' brother.

1049
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:15,592
Huh?

1050
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,256
- Knox...?
- He's feeling up your girl.

1051
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,551
What are you doing?

1052
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,640
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chet.

1053
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,601
- Chet, don't.
- Chet, I know this looks bad, but...

1054
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,311
- Ahh!
- Chet, no, you'll hurt him.

1055
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,358
No, Chet, stop it.

1056
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,315
- Jesus.
- Leave him alone.

1057
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,445
- Goddamn.
- Chet, stop it.

1058
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,323
Bastard.

1059
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,493
- Knox, are you all right?
- Chris, get the hell away from him.

1060
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,869
- Chet, you hurt him.
- Good.

1061
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,157
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1062
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,200
Next time I see you, you die.

1063
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,752
Go ahead, pass it around.

1064
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:02,181
Me and Pitts
are working on a hi-fi system.

1065
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,562
It shouldn't be that hard to put together.

1066
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:09,476
Yeah, I might be going to Yale.

1067
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,148
But I might not.

1068
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,651
Don't you guys
miss having girls around here?

1069
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,316
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1070
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,821
That's part of what this club is about.

1071
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,157
In fact, I'd like to announce

1072
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,574
I published an article in the school paper
in the name of the Dead Poets.

1073
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,201
What?

1074
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,745
- Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
- You didn't.

1075
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,835
- So we can all stop beating off.
- How did you do that?

1076
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm one of the proofers.
I slipped the article in.

1077
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,295
- Look, it's over now.
- Why? Nobody knows who we are.

1078
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,676
Don't you think
they're gonna figure out who wrote it?

1079
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,342
They're gonna come to you and ask
to know what the Dead Poets Society is.

1080
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,887
Charlie, you had no right
to do something like that.

1081
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,351
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.

1082
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,274
That's right, it's Nuwanda.

1083
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,445
And are we just playing around out there,
or do we mean what we say?

1084
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,573
If all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other,

1085
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:58,858
what the hell are we doing?

1086
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:01,493
All right, but you still
shouldn't have done it, Charlie.

1087
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,030
This could mean trouble.
You don't speak for the club.

1088
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,699
Hey, would you not worry
about your precious little neck?

1089
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:10,119
If they catch me,
I'll tell them I made it up.

1090
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,635
Fine.

1091
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,773
Sit.

1092
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,996
This week's issue of <i>Welton Honor,</i>

1093
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:49,659
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.

1094
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:54,961
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons...

1095
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,716
And let me assure you, I will find them.

1096
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,845
- I'm asking any and all students
who know anything about this article

1097
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:05,179
to make themselves known
here and now.

1098
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,432
Whoever the guilty persons are,

1099
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:13,065
this is your only chance
to avoid expulsion from this school.

1100
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,902
Welton Academy, hello?

1101
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,529
Yes, he is. Just a moment.

1102
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,654
Mr. Nolan, it's for you.

1103
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,742
It's God.
He says we should have girls at Welton.

1104
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,680
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1105
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,559
If you think, Mr. Dalton,
that you're the first

1106
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,019
to try to get thrown out of this school,
think again.

1107
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,775
Others have had similar notions

1108
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,399
and have failed
just as surely as you will fail.

1109
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:00,779
Assume the position.

1110
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,162
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

1111
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,339
One.

1112
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,884
Two.

1113
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:33,645
Three.

1114
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,224
Four.

1115
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:38,980
Five.

1116
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,487
What is this Dead Poets Society?
I want names.

1117
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,968
- You kicked out?
- No.

1118
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,138
So, what happened?

1119
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,519
I'm to turn everybody in,
apologize to the school,

1120
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,733
and all will be forgiven.

1121
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,944
So, what are you gonna do?

1122
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,402
- Charlie.
- Damn it, Neil.

1123
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,071
The name is Nuwanda.

1124
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,669
Excuse me.

1125
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,048
- May we have a word, Mr. Keating?
- Certainly.

1126
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,058
This was my first classroom, John.
Did you know that?

1127
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,980
- My first desk.
- I didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.

1128
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,981
English.

1129
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,643
Long before your time.

1130
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,437
It was hard giving it up, I can tell you.

1131
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,159
I'm hearing rumors, John,

1132
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,163
about some unorthodox teaching methods,
in your classroom.

1133
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:18,793
I'm not saying they've had anything to do
with the Dalton boy's outburst,

1134
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:23,582
but I don't think I have to warn you,
boys his age are very impressionable.

1135
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,092
Well, your reprimand
made quite an impression, I'm sure.

1136
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,677
What was going on in the courtyard
the other day?

1137
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:33,886
Courtyard?

1138
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,847
Yeah, boys marching,
clapping in unison.

1139
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,478
Oh, that.
That was an exercise to prove a point.

1140
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:39,889
Dangers of conformity.

1141
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,774
Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven, it works.

1142
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,527
If you question it, what's to prevent them
from doing the same?

1143
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,440
I thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself.

1144
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,653
At these boys' age? Not on your life.

1145
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:55,113
Tradition, John. Discipline.

1146
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:59,117
Prepare them for college
and the rest will take care of itself.

1147
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,505
Creak.

1148
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:10,757
He starts walking around
towards my left. Creak.

1149
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,096
Creak.

1150
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,759
"Assume the position, Mr. Dalton."

1151
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,307
It's all right, gentlemen.

1152
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,268
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. Dalton.

1153
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,729
That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today.

1154
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,609
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?

1155
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,237
What about carpe diem,
sucking all the marrow out of life...?

1156
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:33,151
Sucking the marrow out of life
doesn't mean choking on the bone.

1157
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:38,247
Sure, there's a time for daring,
and there's a time for caution.

1158
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,328
And a wise man understands
which is called for.

1159
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:44,704
- But I thought you'd like that.
- No.

1160
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,669
You being expelled from school
is not daring to me, it's stupid.

1161
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,717
Because you'll miss
some golden opportunities.

1162
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,674
Yeah, like what?

1163
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,931
Like if nothing else,
the opportunity to attend my classes.

1164
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,307
Got it, Ace?

1165
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:03,014
Aye, aye, captain.

1166
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,557
Keep your head about you.

1167
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,606
That goes for the lot of you.

1168
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,648
- Yes, captain.
- Yes, captain.

1169
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,524
Phone call from God.

1170
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,158
If it had been collect,
it would have been daring.

1171
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,039
All right. Go on, play.

1172
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,888
We're trying to rehearse, okay?

1173
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,217
A good persuasion.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.

1174
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:43,138
Wait please. Excitement.
I don't hear any excitement about this play.

1175
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,772
And take her hand.

1176
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:51,904
Bring her down the stage and stop, and,
"There, gentle Hermia." Try again.

1177
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:55,740
- What's for dinner?
- Spaghetti and meatballs.

1178
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,954
Save some for me.

1179
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,542
But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.

1180
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,666
- Father.
- Neil.

1181
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,672
- Before you say anything, please let me...
- Don't you dare talk back to me.

1182
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:22,222
It's bad enough
that you've wasted your time

1183
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:25,684
with this absurd acting business.

1184
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,974
But you deliberately deceived me.

1185
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,611
How did you expect
to get away with this?

1186
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,073
Answer me.

1187
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:41,574
Who put you up to it? Was it
this new man, this, uh, Mr. Keating?

1188
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,490
No, nobody...

1189
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,374
I thought I'd surprise you.

1190
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,920
- I've gotten all A's in every class.
- So did you think I wasn't gonna find out?

1191
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,749
"Oh, my niece is in a play with your son,"
says Mrs. marks.

1192
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,087
"No, no, no," I say.

1193
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,220
"You must be mistaken.
My son's not in a play."

1194
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,721
You made a liar out of me, Neil.

1195
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:08,644
Now, tomorrow, you go to them
and you tell them that you're quitting.

1196
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:12,439
No, I can't. I have the main part.
The performance is tomorrow night.

1197
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,897
I don't care if the world comes to an end
tomorrow. You are through with that play.

1198
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,782
Is that clear?

1199
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,445
Is that clear?

1200
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,030
Yes, sir.

1201
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,880
I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here, Neil.

1202
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:39,920
And you will not let me down.

1203
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,090
No, sir.

1204
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,410
It's open.

1205
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,259
Neil, what's up?

1206
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,592
- Can I speak to you a minute?
- Certainly. Sit down.

1207
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,347
- I'm sorry, here.
- Excuse me.

1208
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,858
- Get you some tea?
- Tea, sure.

1209
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,978
- Like some milk or sugar in that?
- No, thanks.

1210
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,321
Gosh, they don't give you much room
around here.

1211
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,232
No, it's part of the monastic oath.

1212
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,903
They don't want worldly things
distracting me from my teaching.

1213
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,538
- She's pretty.
- She's also in London.

1214
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,703
Makes it a little difficult.

1215
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,121
- How can you stand it?
- Stand what?

1216
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,961
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything.

1217
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,968
- How can you stand being here?
- Because I love teaching.

1218
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,345
I don't want to be anywhere else.

1219
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,471
What's up?

1220
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,848
I just talked to my father.

1221
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,560
He's making me quit the play
at Henley Hall.

1222
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:20,112
Acting's everything to me. I...

1223
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,568
But he doesn't know, he...

1224
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,655
I can see his point.
We're not a rich family like Charlie's.

1225
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:26,909
And we...

1226
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:30,114
But he's planning the rest of my life
for me,

1227
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,578
and he's never asked me what I want.

1228
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,536
Have you ever told your father
what you just told me?

1229
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,247
About your passion for acting.
You ever show him that?

1230
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,837
- I can't.
- Why not?

1231
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:46,381
- I can't talk to him this way.
- Then you're acting for him too.

1232
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,469
You're playing the part of the dutiful son.

1233
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,223
I know this sounds impossible,
but you have to talk to him.

1234
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,353
Show him who you are,
what your heart is.

1235
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,852
I know what he'll say.

1236
01:25:57,194 --> 01:26:00,231
He'll tell me that acting's a whim
and I should forget it.

1237
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,695
That they're counting on me.

1238
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,608
He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind
for my own good.

1239
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:09,449
You are not an indentured servant.
If it's not a whim for you,

1240
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,205
you prove it to him
by your conviction and your passion.

1241
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,788
You show him that,
and if he still doesn't believe you,

1242
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:17,919
well, by then, you'll be out of school
and you can do anything you want.

1243
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,548
No.

1244
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,465
What about the play?
The show's tomorrow night.

1245
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,632
Then you have to talk to him
before tomorrow night.

1246
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,760
I...

1247
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,388
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.

1248
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,816
I'm trapped.

1249
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:46,399
No, you're not.

1250
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,795
I need my notebook.

1251
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,545
I'll see you later, Brian.

1252
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:11,677
Chris.

1253
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,972
Hey, Chris.

1254
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:18,059
- Chris Noel, do you know where she is?
- I think she's in Room 111.

1255
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,848
Thanks.

1256
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,232
I know.

1257
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:28,531
Oh, no.

1258
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,120
- Excuse me. Chris.
- Knox, what are you doing here?

1259
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,122
I came to apologize for the other night.

1260
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,245
I brought you these
and a poem I wrote for you.

1261
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,544
Knox, don't you know
that if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you?

1262
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,379
I don't care.

1263
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:48,509
- I love you, Chris.
- Knox, you're crazy.

1264
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,137
- Look, I acted like a jerk, and I know it.
- Hey.

1265
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,971
- Please accept these. Please?
- No, I... I can't.

1266
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,056
Just forget it.

1267
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:15,700
- Knox, I don't believe this.
- All I'm asking you to do is listen.

1268
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,158
<i>The heavens made a girl named Chris</i>

1269
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,749
<i>With hair and skin of gold</i>

1270
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:29,130
<i>To touch her would be paradise</i>

1271
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,981
- Uhh.
- Get out of here.

1272
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,567
Cameron, you fool.

1273
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,448
- Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her?
- Yeah.

1274
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,366
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

1275
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,532
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?

1276
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:02,872
Nothing. But I did it.

1277
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:06,538
What did she say?
She had to say something.

1278
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,628
- Come here, Knox.
- Seize the day. Whoo-hoo-hoo.

1279
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,720
- Did you talk to your father?
- Uh, yeah.

1280
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,729
He didn't like it one bit,

1281
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,437
but at least he's letting me
stay in the play.

1282
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,694
He won't be able make it.
He's in Chicago.

1283
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,023
But I think he's gonna let me stay
with acting.

1284
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:37,361
Really? You told him what you told me?

1285
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,537
Yeah.

1286
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,198
He wasn't happy.

1287
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:46,461
But he'll be gone at least four days.

1288
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,747
I don't think he'll make the show,

1289
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,843
but I think he'll let me stay with it.

1290
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:55,345
Keep up the school work.

1291
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,300
Thanks.

1292
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,602
- Baby.
- Beautiful baby.

1293
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:11,236
- Henley Hall, here I come.
- Excuse me, just a moment.

1294
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,988
Yes, you.

1295
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,740
Come on, Todd, I'm trying to fix this.

1296
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,152
Come on, Nuwanda,
we're gonna miss Neil's entrance.

1297
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,696
He said something about getting red
before we left.

1298
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,910
Getting red? What does that mean?

1299
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,951
I... Well, you know Charlie.

1300
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,964
So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" bit?

1301
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,967
What is that?

1302
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,928
It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility.

1303
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,594
Makes me feel potent.
Like it can drive girls crazy.

1304
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,059
Oh, come on, Charlie.
The girls are waiting.

1305
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:50,642
- Henley Hall.
- Whoa.

1306
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:58,487
Chris.

1307
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,784
- What are you doing here?
- Gentlemen, let's go.

1308
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,577
- Go ahead, guys, I'll catch up.
- Yeah, come on, guys.

1309
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:09,873
Chris, you can't be in here.

1310
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,959
If they catch you,
we're gonna be in trouble.

1311
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,418
- Come on.
- Oh, but it's fine...

1312
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:14,958
Chris.

1313
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,756
It's fine for you to come into my school
and make a complete fool out of me?

1314
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:24,392
- I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
- Well, you did.

1315
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,553
Chet found out,
and it took everything I could do

1316
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:29,268
to keep him from coming here
and killing you.

1317
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,649
Knox, you have got to stop this stuff.

1318
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,902
I can't, Chris. I love you.

1319
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:37,189
Knox, you say that over and over.

1320
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,733
You don't even know me.

1321
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,867
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

1322
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:43,448
Go ahead, captain. I'll walk.

1323
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:50,370
Knox. Knox, if it just so happens
that I could care less about you...

1324
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,124
Then you wouldn't be here
warning me about Chet.

1325
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,347
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for the play.

1326
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:07,636
- Are you going with him?
- Chet, to a play? Are you kidding?

1327
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:10,305
- Then come with me.
- Knox, you are so infuriating.

1328
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,065
Come on, Chris,
just give me one chance.

1329
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:15,852
If you don't like me after tonight,
I'll stay away forever.

1330
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,398
- Uh-huh.
- I promise. Dead Poets' honor.

1331
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:20,656
You come with me tonight,

1332
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:23,284
then if you don't want to see me again,
I swear, I'll bow out.

1333
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,987
You know what would happen
if Chet found out?

1334
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,781
He won't know anything.

1335
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,951
We'll sit in the back and sneak away
as soon as it's over.

1336
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:34,792
And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it.

1337
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,206
Dead Poets' honor.

1338
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,966
What is that?

1339
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,503
My word.

1340
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:57,027
You are so infuriating.

1341
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,834
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1342
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,469
Shh. Boys.

1343
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:34,806
Either I mistake your shape
or making quite,

1344
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:39,068
Or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite

1345
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,479
Called Robin Goodfellow.

1346
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:44,445
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.

1347
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,361
I jest to Oberon and make him smile

1348
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,202
When I a fat
and bean-fed horse, pbbt, beguile,

1349
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,375
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.

1350
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:59,877
Sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,

1351
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,838
And when she drink,
against her lips I bob

1352
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,594
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.

1353
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,763
He's good. He's really good.

1354
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,476
Sometime for three-foot stool
mistaketh me;

1355
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,262
Then slip I from her bum,
down topples she,

1356
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,056
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;

1357
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:20,102
And then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh,

1358
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:24,649
And waxen in their mirth
and neeze and swear

1359
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,905
A merrier hour was never wasted there.

1360
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,321
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

1361
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,536
And here my mistress.
Would that he were gone!

1362
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,540
Then by your side
no bed-room me deny;

1363
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,626
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

1364
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,462
Lysander riddles very prettily:

1365
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,380
Now much beshrew
my manners and my pride,

1366
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:52,096
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.

1367
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,103
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy

1368
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:57,639
Lie further off; in human modesty,

1369
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:01,776
Such separation as many well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,

1370
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,774
and, good night, sweet friend:

1371
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,155
Thy love ne'er alter
till thy sweet life end!

1372
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:10,069
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

1373
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,362
Neil. That's your cue, Neil.

1374
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,657
Come on, Neil.
Here's your crown. Let's go.

1375
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,108
If we shadows have offended,

1376
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:28,317
Think but this, and all is mended,

1377
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:32,109
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.

1378
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:36,496
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,

1379
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:43,708
Gentles, do not reprehend:
if you pardon, we will mend:

1380
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,373
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck

1381
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:52,387
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;

1382
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,430
Else the Puck a liar call;

1383
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,563
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,

1384
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:06,184
And Robin shall restore amends.

1385
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:41,431
Yeah!

1386
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,353
Yeah, Neil.

1387
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:56,409
Great job, Neil.

1388
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,862
Great show, everyone.

1389
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:08,830
Excuse me, I'm Neil's father.
I need to see him.

1390
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:16,262
Your father, he's...

1391
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:18,552
What did you think of it?

1392
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:23,516
Really, I thought
you were all just wonderful.

1393
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,818
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

1394
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:42,329
- Excuse me, please.
- Neil. Neil.

1395
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:45,291
- Neil.
- We love you, wait.

1396
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,459
- I can't, guys.
- Neil.

1397
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,837
- Neil.
- Excuse me.

1398
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,841
Neil. Neil. You have the gift.

1399
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:57,045
What a performance.
You left even me speechless.

1400
01:38:57,223 --> 01:38:58,713
- You have to stay...
- Get in the car.

1401
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:02,008
Keating, you stay away from my son.

1402
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,889
Neil. Neil. Mr. Perry, come on.

1403
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:09,307
Don't make it any worse than it is.

1404
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,947
Is it okay if we walk back?

1405
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,161
Captain?

1406
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:31,503
Knox.

1407
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:36,251
- We'll be home about 11:30 still.
- I know where he gets it.

1408
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:19,257
Ahem. We're trying very hard to understand
why it is that you insist on defying us.

1409
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:25,550
Whatever the reason,
we're not gonna let you ruin your life.

1410
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,385
Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you
from Welton

1411
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:29,349
and enrolling you
in Braden Military School.

1412
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,557
You're going to Harvard
and you're gonna be a doctor.

1413
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:37,896
But that's 10 more years.

1414
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:40,156
- Father, that's a lifetime.
- Oh, stop it.

1415
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:43,944
Don't be so dramatic.
You make it sound like a prison term.

1416
01:40:45,414 --> 01:40:47,496
You don't understand, Neil.

1417
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,783
You have opportunities
that I never even dreamt of.

1418
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:53,203
- I am not going to let you waste them.
- I've got to tell you what I feel.

1419
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,589
- We've been so worried about...
- What? What? Tell me what you feel.

1420
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,505
What is it?

1421
01:41:09,355 --> 01:41:12,722
Is it more of this...?
This acting business?

1422
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,684
Because you can forget that.

1423
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,111
What?

1424
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:25,784
Nothing.

1425
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,250
Nothing?

1426
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:46,797
Well, then, let's go to bed.

1427
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,271
I was good.

1428
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:05,278
I was really good.

1429
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:12,498
Go on, get some sleep.

1430
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:48,360
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1431
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,768
- What was that?
- What?

1432
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:10,853
- That sound.
- What sound?

1433
01:46:17,663 --> 01:46:19,199
Tom?

1434
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,075
What is it?

1435
01:46:26,922 --> 01:46:28,662
What's wrong?

1436
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:40,515
Neil?

1437
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:49,229
Tom, what is it?

1438
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:52,193
What's wrong?

1439
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,572
Neil?

1440
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:04,744
- Neil?
- I'll look outside.

1441
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:07,668
Neil?

1442
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:29,891
No!

1443
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:31,520
Oh, Neil!

1444
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,107
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

1445
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:38,024
- No, no, no. He's all right.
- Oh, my son. My son, my poor son.

1446
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:42,320
- He's all right. He's all right. He's all right.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1447
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,452
Stop it.

1448
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,001
Todd?

1449
01:47:54,843 --> 01:47:58,461
- Todd.
- Oh, Charlie.

1450
01:48:05,688 --> 01:48:07,269
What is it?

1451
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,651
Neil's dead.

1452
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:57,985
It's so beautiful.

1453
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,327
Todd. It's okay, Todd.

1454
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:14,961
- Calm down.
- It's all right, Todd.

1455
01:49:16,341 --> 01:49:17,922
Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.

1456
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:19,924
It's all right.

1457
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,835
- Now, listen.
- He wouldn't have done it.

1458
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:23,800
- You can't explain it.
- It was his father.

1459
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,636
- No.
- He wouldn't have left us.

1460
01:49:27,311 --> 01:49:30,018
He wouldn't have. His dad was...

1461
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:31,599
- Todd.
- His father did it.

1462
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:34,766
- His father killed him.
- You can't explain it, Todd.

1463
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:39,899
- Todd.
- Leave him be.

1464
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:44,984
Neil!

1465
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:21,644
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.

1466
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:28,022
He was a fine student.

1467
01:52:29,326 --> 01:52:31,692
One of Welton's best.

1468
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:35,741
And he will be missed.

1469
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:44,205
We've contacted each of your parents
to explain the situation.

1470
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:47,125
Naturally, they're all quite concerned.

1471
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:56,092
At the request of Neil's family,

1472
01:52:56,895 --> 01:53:01,559
I intend to conduct a thorough enquiry
into this matter.

1473
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:07,277
Your complete cooperation is expected.

1474
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:19,823
- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.

1475
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:22,243
That's it, guys. We're all fried.

1476
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:25,037
- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.

1477
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:28,332
- He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.
- About what?

1478
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:31,635
The club, Pittsie. Think about it.

1479
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:35,514
The board of directors,
the trustees and Mr. Nolan.

1480
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:39,302
Do you think for one moment
they're gonna let this thing just blow over?

1481
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:42,391
Schools go down
because of things like this.

1482
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:43,772
They need a scapegoat.

1483
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,243
What's going on, guys?

1484
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:04,872
You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

1485
01:54:05,213 --> 01:54:07,124
Finked? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1486
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:10,041
You told Nolan everything about the club
is what I'm talking about.

1487
01:54:10,218 --> 01:54:11,833
Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,

1488
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:15,550
there's something called an honor code
at this school, all right?

1489
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:18,761
If a teacher asks you a question,
you tell the truth or you're expelled.

1490
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,513
- You little punk.
- Charlie.

1491
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:24,680
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
so he ratted to save himself.

1492
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,473
Don't touch him. You do and you're out.

1493
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,642
- I'm out anyway.
- You don't know that, not yet.

1494
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,811
He's right there, Charlie.

1495
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:34,732
And if you guys are smart, you will do
exactly what I did and cooperate.

1496
01:54:35,827 --> 01:54:39,661
They're not after us. We're the victims.

1497
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:42,414
Us and Neil.

1498
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:44,833
What's that mean? Who are they after?

1499
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,287
Why, Mr. Keating, of course.
The "captain" himself.

1500
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:52,374
I mean, you guys didn't really think
he could avoid responsibility, did you?

1501
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:54,668
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil?

1502
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:58,134
- Is that what they're saying?
- Well, who else do you think, dumb-ass?

1503
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:01,015
The administration? Mr. Perry?

1504
01:55:01,186 --> 01:55:03,598
Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap,
didn't he?

1505
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:07,814
If it wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be
cozied up in his room right now

1506
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:09,815
studying his chemistry
and dreaming of being...

1507
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:12,022
That is not true, Cameron.
You know that.

1508
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:15,109
He didn't put us up to anything.
Neil loved acting.

1509
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:18,821
Believe what you want,
but I say let Keating fry.

1510
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:22,070
I mean, why ruin our lives?

1511
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,914
Charlie.

1512
01:55:25,127 --> 01:55:26,458
- You dummy.
- Charlie.

1513
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:35,133
You just signed your expulsion papers,
Nuwanda.

1514
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:42,216
And if the rest of you are smart,
you'll do exactly what I did.

1515
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:46,557
They know everything anyway.

1516
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:51,274
You can't save Keating,

1517
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:54,102
but you can save yourselves.

1518
01:56:27,564 --> 01:56:30,101
Knox Overstreet.

1519
01:56:56,885 --> 01:56:59,376
- Meeks.
- Go away, I have to study.

1520
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:05,549
- What happened to Nuwanda?
- Expelled.

1521
01:57:08,355 --> 01:57:10,016
What'd you tell them?

1522
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,181
Nothing they didn't already know.

1523
01:57:15,111 --> 01:57:17,193
Todd Anderson.

1524
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:41,376
- Hello, son.
- Hello, darling.

1525
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,213
Mom.

1526
01:57:51,106 --> 01:57:53,222
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

1527
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:02,905
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here.

1528
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:08,241
You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?

1529
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:13,249
Answer him, Todd.

1530
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,037
Yes, sir.

1531
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:24,424
I have here a detailed description
of what occurred at your meetings.

1532
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,338
It describes how your teacher,
Mr. Keating,

1533
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,928
encouraged you boys
to organize this club

1534
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:34,347
and to use it as a source of inspiration
for reckless and self-indulgent behavior.

1535
01:58:34,524 --> 01:58:38,767
It describes how Mr. Keating,
both in and out of the classroom,

1536
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:43,063
encouraged Neil Perry
to follow his obsession with acting

1537
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:48,902
when he knew all along it was against
the explicit orders of Neil's parents.

1538
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:52,914
It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse
of his position as teacher

1539
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:56,163
that led directly to Neil Perry's death.

1540
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:08,930
Read that document carefully, Todd.

1541
01:59:11,227 --> 01:59:13,309
Very carefully.

1542
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:22,061
If you've nothing to add or amend,
sign it.

1543
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:25,692
What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?

1544
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:30,031
I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

1545
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:38,330
McAllister:
Grass is <i>garment</i> or <i>herbal.</i>

1546
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:41,083
<i>Lapis</i> is stone.

1547
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:45,125
The entire building is <i>aedificium.</i>

1548
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:22,879
Sit.

1549
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:26,959
I'll be teaching this class
through exams.

1550
02:00:27,137 --> 02:00:30,345
We'll find a permanent English teacher
during the break.

1551
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:35,717
Who will tell me where you are
in the Pritchard textbook?

1552
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,021
Mr. Anderson.

1553
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:49,109
- In the... In the Pr...
- I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.

1554
02:00:49,284 --> 02:00:51,570
In the Pritchard?

1555
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:53,867
Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.

1556
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:58,369
We skipped around a lot, sir.
We covered the romantics

1557
02:00:58,543 --> 02:01:01,250
and some of the chapters
on post Civil War literature.

1558
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:03,161
What about the realists?

1559
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:06,706
I believe we skipped most of that, sir.

1560
02:01:07,927 --> 02:01:09,588
All right, then, we'll start over.

1561
02:01:13,057 --> 02:01:15,013
What is poetry?

1562
02:01:19,272 --> 02:01:20,853
Come.

1563
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,316
Excuse me.

1564
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:30,230
I came for my personals.

1565
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:34,318
- Should I come back after class?
- Get them now, Mr. Keating.

1566
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:40,661
Gentlemen, turn to page 21
of the introduction.

1567
02:01:42,212 --> 02:01:43,418
Mr. Cameron,

1568
02:01:44,547 --> 02:01:48,836
read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr. Pritchard

1569
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:51,376
on "Understanding Poetry."

1570
02:01:53,515 --> 02:01:55,255
That page has been ripped out, sir.

1571
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:59,726
- Well, borrow somebody else's book.
- They're all ripped out, sir.

1572
02:01:59,938 --> 02:02:01,849
What do you mean,
they're all ripped out?

1573
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:06,687
- Sir, we...
- Never mind.

1574
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:13,027
Read.

1575
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:19,951
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

1576
02:02:20,124 --> 02:02:21,284
To fully understand poetry,

1577
02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:25,122
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,

1578
02:02:25,296 --> 02:02:26,581
then ask two questions.

1579
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:30,249
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

1580
02:02:30,468 --> 02:02:32,083
And two:

1581
02:02:33,638 --> 02:02:36,596
How important is that objective?

1582
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:40,475
Question one rates the poem's perfection.
Question two rates its importance.

1583
02:02:40,645 --> 02:02:42,431
And once these questions
have been answered,

1584
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:45,563
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

1585
02:02:45,733 --> 02:02:48,896
If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph..."

1586
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:51,231
- Mr. Keating, they made everybody sign it.
- Quiet.

1587
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:52,737
You gotta believe me, it's true.

1588
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,898
- I do believe you, Todd.
- Leave, Mr. Keating.

1589
02:02:55,076 --> 02:02:56,816
- But it wasn't his fault.
- Sit down.

1590
02:02:57,036 --> 02:02:59,152
One more outburst from you
or anyone else,

1591
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,616
and you're out of this school.

1592
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,827
Leave, Mr. Keating.

1593
02:03:05,795 --> 02:03:08,457
I said leave, Mr. Keating.

1594
02:03:24,272 --> 02:03:25,352
<i>O Captain! my Captain!</i>

1595
02:03:25,565 --> 02:03:28,432
Sit down, Mr. Anderson.

1596
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:32,602
Do you hear me? Sit down.

1597
02:03:33,323 --> 02:03:35,405
Sit down.

1598
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:40,322
This is your final warning, Anderson.

1599
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:42,991
How dare you?

1600
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:45,498
Do you hear me?

1601
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:47,374
<i>O Captain! my Captain!</i>

1602
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:52,589
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you. Sit down.

1603
02:03:55,219 --> 02:03:57,005
Sit down.

1604
02:03:57,221 --> 02:03:58,882
Sit down. All of you.

1605
02:03:59,432 --> 02:04:02,299
I want you seated. Sit down.

1606
02:04:02,477 --> 02:04:03,887
Leave, Mr. Keating.

1607
02:04:12,403 --> 02:04:14,894
All of you, down. I want you seated.

1608
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:17,609
Do you hear me?

1609
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,655
Sit down.

1610
02:05:06,124 --> 02:05:07,955
Thank you, boys.

1611
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:11,413
Thank you.
