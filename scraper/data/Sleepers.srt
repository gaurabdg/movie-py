1
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,533
This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

2
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,455
This is my story & that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

3
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,377
Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

4
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,589
The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

5
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,259
...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

6
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,057
I'm the only one who could speak for
them...and the children we were.

7
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,494
My three friends and
I were inseparable...

8
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,455
...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

9
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,666
The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

10
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,380
...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

11
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,218
Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

12
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,261
Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

13
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,890
and Eastern European laborers.
Hard men living hard lives.

14
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,112
We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

15
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,156
Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

16
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,166
I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

17
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,259
Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

18
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,970
Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

19
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,055
The will of the Church was forceful.

20
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,183
For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

21
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,355
Yet, despite the harshness of life...

22
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,608
...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

23
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,318
...enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

24
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,573
Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

25
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,659
When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

26
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,578
...and, in some cases, final.

27
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,582
A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

28
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,044
A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

29
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,838
It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

30
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,718
Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence...ruled by corruption.

31
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,390
My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

32
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,267
We each served as altar boys.

33
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,728
Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

34
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,688
since the funeral included a $3 fee...

35
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,066
...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

36
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,320
There was an active competition
between the four of us...

37
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,072
...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

38
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,492
Two weeks into the new school year,

39
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,535
I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

40
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,371
...and I was ready for the big leagues.

41
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,416
In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

42
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,752
...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

43
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,171
...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

44
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,424
In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

45
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,355
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

46
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,774
And you will receive the gifts...

47
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,275
...of the Holy Spirit.

48
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,493
It's gonna be a great day and your...

49
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,996
...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptized...

50
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,833
...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

51
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,793
-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

52
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,962
What clacker?

53
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,796
Now!

54
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,340
Let everyone rise.

55
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,803
Let us pray.

56
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,440
Nuns are such easy targets.

57
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,819
John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

58
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,905
We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

59
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,825
And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

60
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,369
A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

61
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,122
...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

62
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,791
Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

63
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,169
or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

64
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,004
...committed by people we knew.

65
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,591
The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

66
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,800
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

67
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,386
What if our mothers are out there?

68
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,014
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

69
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,724
What if we hear something worse?

70
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,225
Like what?

71
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,604
Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

72
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,108
Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

73
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,827
Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

74
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,455
I...sleep with married men.

75
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,333
Men with families.

76
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,588
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

77
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,467
Yes?

78
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,971
You see, I'm...I'm pregnant.

79
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,310
The father?

80
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,645
Take a number.

81
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,480
What are you going to do?

82
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,024
I know what you want me to do.

83
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,360
And I know what I should do.

84
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,697
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

85
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,909
Look, I gotta go.

86
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,663
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

87
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,873
I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

88
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,589
She knew.

89
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,508
Yeah, she knew.

90
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,552
Why do you think she told us all that?

91
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,222
I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

92
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,104
Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

93
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,940
...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

94
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,234
...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

95
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,946
He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

96
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,782
He was a friend...a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

97
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,367
You know what crap like
that does to your body?

98
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,954
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

99
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,916
Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

100
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,793
No, nothing.

101
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,754
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

102
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:06,796
Who says?

103
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,675
Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

104
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,053
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

105
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,095
You don't?

106
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,806
Maybe I got the wrong information.

107
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,391
I guess you did.

108
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,519
I'll see you later tonight.

109
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,188
What's tonight?

110
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,107
I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

111
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,109
...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

112
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,444
Your mother said you'd love to help.

113
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,112
I bet she did.

114
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,285
Shakes...l don't want you
getting into any trouble.

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,454
Come on, Father, you know I never do.

116
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,664
That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

117
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:42,874
That's it?

118
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,709
That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

119
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,461
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

120
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,422
And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

121
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,465
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,633
All right...see you.

123
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,556
Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

124
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,226
which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

125
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,730
But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

126
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,817
Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

127
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,360
her mother having died at childbirth.

128
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,239
Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

129
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,157
We could always count on Carol...

130
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,451
...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

131
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,204
While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

132
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,414
...waiting to see the skaters perform...

133
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,833
...we each had one eye in a hole...

134
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,460
...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

135
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,962
...get into their skaters' outfits.

136
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,758
This is what heaven must be about.

137
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,269
Carol, you want to take a look?

138
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,730
Like it's something I haven't seen?

139
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,399
You're so lucky!

140
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,946
She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

141
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
When my friends and I were young,

142
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,867
...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

143
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,288
When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

144
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,624
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

145
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,127
But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

146
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,839
There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

147
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,968
...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

148
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,305
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

149
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,892
I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

150
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,019
As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

151
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,481
He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

152
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,193
And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

153
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,238
...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

154
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,115
...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

155
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,077
King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

156
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,745
You know what King Benny does?

157
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,541
He waits. He waits 8 years...

158
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,085
...to get even with that prick.

159
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,545
He walks into a public bath house.

160
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,838
The guy's soaking in the tub.

161
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,052
King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

162
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,014
Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

163
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,061
"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

164
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,271
Then he pulls out a gun...

165
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,566
...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

166
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,279
Then he says to the guy:

167
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,450
"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

168
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,287
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

169
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,623
Revenge!

170
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,501
Revenge!

171
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,631
Can I talk to you for a minute?

172
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,176
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

173
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,179
You're the butcher's kid...am I right?

174
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,350
What kind of a job are you looking for?

175
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,060
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

176
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,104
It doesn't matter?

177
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,442
Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

178
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,152
Who is everybody?

179
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,029
People from the neighborhood.

180
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,116
Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

181
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,285
They know you got jobs.

182
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,709
Sorry I wasted your time.

183
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,295
Hold on a sec!

184
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,007
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

185
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,009
-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

186
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
You'll be here?

187
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,179
I'm always here.

188
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,356
My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

189
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,358
...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

190
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,153
In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

191
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,781
...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

192
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,325
It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

193
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,870
Come on, let's go! Right here.

194
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,580
Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

195
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,916
You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

196
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

197
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,255
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

198
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,718
Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

199
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,595
This time they took my money!

200
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,263
You took the money from the boy?

201
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,515
The money they took is in the bag.

202
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,349
Let me have the bag.

203
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,183
Fuck you!

204
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,477
How about now?

205
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,728
All right, take it easy.

206
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,732
You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

207
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,858
Let me have the bag.

208
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,571
Now, go!

209
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,614
What about them?

210
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,448
You care?

211
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,326
Then go! Go! Run!

212
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,163
I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

213
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,832
What you need?

214
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,333
My friends.

215
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,420
Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

216
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,256
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

217
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,135
Okay, get your friends.

218
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,930
Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

219
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,017
He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

220
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,768
...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

221
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,812
He didn't want that to happen to us.

222
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,273
You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

223
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,107
It pays.

224
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,483
A lot of things pay.

225
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,484
Not like this.

226
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,114
Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

227
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,743
Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

228
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,369
Good shot!

229
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,081
I found an art class for you to take.

230
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,750
You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

231
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,169
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

232
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,422
It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

233
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,341
Maybe, or it could be the first step.

234
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,633
First step to what?

235
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,843
Doing something with your life.

236
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,511
You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

237
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,429
You all can get out of here.

238
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,348
Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

239
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,518
Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

240
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,355
It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

241
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,608
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

242
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,234
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

243
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,905
He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

244
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,283
Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

245
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,619
Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

246
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,245
...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

247
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,122
It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

248
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,749
Well, for Michelangelo it was.

249
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,001
Michelangelo needed the job...

250
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,128
...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

251
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,590
And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

252
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,383
What's his father?

253
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,220
He was like a low-level...con guy.

254
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,930
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

255
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:12,764
Goats?

256
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,265
Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

257
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,100
-Chickens?
-Chickens?

258
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,476
You know what happened?

259
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,771
He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

260
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,815
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

261
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,900
Did he pay off the loans?

262
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,193
Every single one of them.

263
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,279
How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

264
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,948
It took him about 9 years.

265
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,366
9 years?!

266
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,701
That's a big ceiling!

267
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,829
I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

268
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,955
And he had a bum leg.

269
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,332
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

270
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,211
Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

271
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,504
You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

272
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,548
Sixteenth Chapel?

273
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,507
Who painted the other fifteen?

274
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,478
Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

275
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,398
...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

276
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,985
Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

277
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,739
...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

278
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,283
...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

279
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,909
...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

280
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,370
...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

281
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,166
We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

282
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,711
...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

283
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,009
A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

284
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,929
...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

285
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,766
...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

286
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,729
For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

287
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,108
They might as well have occurred in
another country...in another century.

288
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,861
Our attention was elsewhere.

289
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,907
We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

290
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,575
...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

291
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,578
A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

292
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,082
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

293
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,963
Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

294
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,674
I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

295
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,383
John Reilly.

296
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,801
The little punk!

297
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,470
He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

298
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,971
You put him in the hospital.

299
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,642
He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

300
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,269
What are you? About 220, 230?

301
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,607
You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weights?

302
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,528
80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

303
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,698
If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

304
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,326
Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

305
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,912
Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

306
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,417
And I may not be in your division, but
I do weight more than 85 pounds.

307
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,295
And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

308
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,506
...to pray over your body.

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,095
See you in church.

310
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,270
Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

311
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,106
It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

312
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,237
We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

313
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,906
...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

314
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,910
Come on, Davy...take this chump out.
He got nothing!

315
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:21,870
Shut up!

316
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,246
Who's that?

317
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,581
His sister.

318
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,416
What happened to her?

319
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,753
I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

320
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,087
Worry about the game, come on.

321
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,799
Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

322
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,177
He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

323
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,471
Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

324
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,056
This is it...home run!

325
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,725
Easy, Mike.

326
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,478
What the fuck you
looking at, little dick?!

327
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,813
She's nothing but charm.

328
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,274
Come on, Davy!

329
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,776
You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

330
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,111
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

331
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,197
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

332
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,199
You could've helped her
across the street...

333
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,450
...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

334
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,701
You didn't have to throw the game.

335
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,120
Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

336
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,456
You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

337
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,167
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

338
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,586
He's no better than you.

339
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,213
He was today.

340
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,881
No. You let him be.

341
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,426
All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

342
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,595
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

343
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,140
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

344
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,476
And when it does, it's
going to hurt...bad.

345
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:30,188
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

346
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,731
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

347
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,442
Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

348
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,985
Do you see that street?

349
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,739
That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetizers.

350
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,243
Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

351
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,829
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

352
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,165
Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

353
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,669
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

354
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,879
All right, all right, calm down.

355
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,048
It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

356
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,633
Be funny, limp dick.

357
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,969
Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

358
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,804
You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

359
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,806
Thanks a lot, fat man.

360
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,310
In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

361
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,396
But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

362
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,898
...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

363
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,900
...was more than the right thing to do.

364
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,037
Come on, let's go swimming.

365
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,456
The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

366
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,750
...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

367
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,878
I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

368
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,255
a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

369
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,424
Can't you feel the breeze up here?

370
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,509
What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

371
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:42,594
The devil couldn't stand this heat.

372
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,970
Will you guys shut up, please?

373
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,263
I'm trying to get my burn.

374
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,765
It's 98 degrees!

375
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,517
-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

376
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,853
We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

377
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,231
I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

378
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,277
I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

379
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,989
We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air...choose.

380
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,659
Air is probably safer, Mike.

381
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,120
Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

382
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,331
Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

383
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,749
Yours!

384
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,919
-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

385
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,754
-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

386
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,922
-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

387
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,091
-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

388
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:21,925
I'm not going.

389
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,093
-Why?
-It's too hot.

390
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,178
If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

391
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,642
Mustard and onions. No soda.

392
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,268
I know you!

393
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,104
I look like a lot of people.

394
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,272
The scam was simple.

395
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,859
I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

396
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,697
The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

397
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,033
This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

398
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,662
He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

399
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,997
The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

400
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,083
...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

401
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,963
I'm gonna need two napkins?

402
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,258
Pay my money, thief!

403
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,850
Wow! Ketchup!

404
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,268
I took it from him and ran!

405
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,522
I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

406
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:22,193
The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

407
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:24,779
You gonna give me two?

408
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,250
You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

409
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,420
Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

410
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,921
They're heavier than shit!

411
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,257
Think we can push it, the three of us?

412
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,301
Push it where?

413
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,554
A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

414
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,390
...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

415
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,622
The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

416
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,624
I was on the other side of the street.

417
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,711
He was beat...but not beaten.

418
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,798
He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

419
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,551
Give it up.

420
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:42,732
What's wrong, Mikey?

421
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,861
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

422
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,531
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

423
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,703
You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

424
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,247
-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

425
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:58,373
He still near?

426
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,917
I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

427
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,505
The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

428
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,591
We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

429
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,927
Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

430
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,054
We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

431
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,391
Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

432
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,144
To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

433
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,062
But, we would all pay a price.

434
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:25,775
It only took a minute...but
in that minute...everything changed.

435
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,028
Guys, I can't hold it!

436
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,904
-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

437
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,949
I can't hold it!

438
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,590
Stop! God, no! !

439
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,197
Damn!

440
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:21,581
Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

441
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,668
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

442
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,086
I think we just killed a man.

443
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,719
While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

444
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,307
...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

445
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,267
I'm sorry, dad.

446
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,977
'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

447
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,315
Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

448
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,902
You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

449
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,696
Mom, tell him to calm down, mom!

450
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,198
Mario, stop it!

451
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,867
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

452
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:02,539
Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

453
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,025
I hear you're short an altar boy.

454
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
You still remember what to do?

455
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,284
Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

456
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,495
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

457
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,457
Get ready...we got 5 minutes
till show time.

458
00:27:58,678 --> 00:27:59,971
I'm gonna miss this.

459
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,517
I'm gonna miss all of this.

460
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,981
I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

461
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,239
I could run...we all could run.

462
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,577
Disappear for a while.

463
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:24,954
Nobody's gonna come looking.

464
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,086
Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

465
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,386
You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

466
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,141
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

467
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:48,770
You've gotta face this.

468
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,277
I can't, Father.

469
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,365
I don't want to face it.

470
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,244
I'm too scared to face it.

471
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,372
I'm scared, too.

472
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:12,335
Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

473
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:19,300
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

474
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:21,720
You understand?

475
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,060
Come on. We got an audience.

476
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,529
I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

477
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,909
Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

478
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,247
It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

479
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,838
This is one of my favorites.

480
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,174
What is?

481
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:04,929
"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren...you do to me."

482
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:10,602
Come on.

483
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,277
We never saw the vendor as a man...

484
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,988
...not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood.

485
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,283
And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

486
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,996
We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

487
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,916
...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

488
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,752
We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

489
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:39,839
We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

490
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,262
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

491
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,265
...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

492
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,309
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

493
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,939
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

494
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,858
...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

495
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,318
...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

496
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,195
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

497
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,324
Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

498
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,493
...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

499
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,663
...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

500
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,042
...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

501
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,795
Michael Sullivan.

502
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,256
The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

503
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,008
...for a period of no more than
18 months...

504
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:25,468
...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

505
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,471
And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

506
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,725
...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

507
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,436
...l would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

508
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,856
I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

509
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,525
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

510
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,363
Could you do me a favor?

511
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:46,906
What do you want? Name it.

512
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,284
The past couple of weeks...

513
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,037
...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

514
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,039
Could you watch over them for me?

515
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,081
I will.

516
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:59,586
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

517
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,463
You mean, you want me to lie?

518
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,134
It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

519
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,430
Come on, let's go.

520
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,266
Be strong.

521
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,642
I will.

522
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,642
The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

523
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,727
...housed in 5 separate units.

524
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:01,314
From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

525
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:02,816
...wanted it to resemble...

526
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,694
...some kind of nice
school or university.

527
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:11,074
Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

528
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:16,162
We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

529
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:20,041
...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

530
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,044
...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

531
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,049
I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

532
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,271
Hello, Carcaterra.

533
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,441
Toss your clothes on the floor.

534
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,234
Here?

535
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,653
Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

536
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:49,779
Now, lose the clothes.

537
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:51,656
In front of you?

538
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:01,416
Let's go, let's go!

539
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,804
What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

540
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,432
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

541
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,810
I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

542
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,532
Everything.

543
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,202
You want me to stand here naked?

544
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,495
Now you're catching on.

545
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,040
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

546
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,965
Now, what?

547
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:54,803
Get dressed.

548
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,352
There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

549
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,855
...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

550
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:10,360
Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

551
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,445
...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

552
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,780
...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

553
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:18,284
Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

554
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,371
Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

555
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,581
...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

556
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,044
It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

557
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,380
Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

558
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,299
A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

559
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,095
All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

560
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,598
And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

561
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,720
What the fuck did you do that for?

562
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,556
You got close to me.

563
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:22,724
So?

564
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,976
It bothers me.

565
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,897
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

566
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,664
You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

567
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,751
You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

568
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,503
...the day you walked in here.

569
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,759
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

570
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,927
There's nothing to see.

571
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,848
Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

572
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,309
Go on.

573
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,030
That go for me too?

574
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,032
No, it don't go for you.

575
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:06,911
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

576
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,708
You and me...we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

577
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,168
Maybe at dinner.

578
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:17,756
So...you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

579
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,551
I got to smell it.

580
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,888
You got to smell it...

581
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,225
That's good.

582
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,686
Where you going?

583
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:33,730
You said to get lunch.

584
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,776
You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

585
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,278
...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

586
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,447
You could smell it.

587
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,287
I'm not hungry.

588
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,582
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

589
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,418
You eat...because I'm
telling you to eat.

590
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,716
I'm still not hungry.

591
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,891
I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

592
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:10,934
Now, eat.

593
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,648
Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

594
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:21,069
Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

595
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:26,116
Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

596
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:30,328
You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

597
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:34,332
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

598
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,292
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

599
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:42,173
None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

600
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,468
You got that? Hey you....

601
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,596
There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

602
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,933
Come on now, that's good.

603
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,519
Show the boys how you follow my rules.

604
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,022
Rules! You understand?

605
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,859
Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

606
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,777
Your shift's over, Nokes.

607
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,532
I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

608
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,826
...l gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

609
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:13,038
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

610
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,040
Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

611
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:18,209
This one, I'm staying in.

612
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,049
Don't fuck with me, boy.

613
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,262
No, Nokes...you fuck with me.

614
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,265
I'm asking you.

615
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,732
You're eating into my shift.

616
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,238
I'll get out of your way...for now.

617
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,033
I'll take what I can get.

618
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,245
You boys get off your knees.

619
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,220
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

620
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:14,099
I don't understand you boys.

621
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,393
I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

622
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,728
You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

623
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:22,190
I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

624
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:25,985
...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

625
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,364
And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

626
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,784
You had rules, and you had discipline.

627
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:38,915
Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

628
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,753
Right around there to the right.
There you go.

629
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,889
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

630
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,309
That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

631
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,776
We understand each other?

632
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:08,778
Turn and face the wall.

633
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:21,458
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

634
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,336
...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

635
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,097
What do you want?

636
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,726
A blow job.

637
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,194
Down on your knees.

638
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,116
Face the wall.

639
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,886
There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

640
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,597
I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

641
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:21,351
What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

642
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:22,936
...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

643
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,438
...and the end of my childhood.

644
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:38,618
Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

645
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:41,788
I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

646
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:42,914
...all that had happened to me.

647
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:46,459
Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

648
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,628
Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

649
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,797
John's mother came up once a month.

650
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:56,886
But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

651
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,142
So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

652
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:05,395
Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

653
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,690
If we did, reprisals would be severe.

654
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:25,081
You lost a few pounds.

655
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,417
It's not exactly home cooking.

656
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:29,794
Sit down.

657
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:32,964
This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

658
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:37,135
I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

659
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,763
I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

660
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:41,598
...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

661
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:44,976
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

662
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:48,271
Anything at all?

663
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:52,025
You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

664
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:56,404
I appreciate it and all, but...

665
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,282
...l don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

666
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:27,519
I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

667
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,438
You have any friends not in jail?

668
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:33,983
Not as many as I would like.

669
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:36,820
What's he in for?

670
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:42,242
Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

671
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:44,703
And he's a good friend?

672
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,496
He's my best friend.

673
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:50,542
We hung out together.

674
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,586
We were close...
just like you and the guys.

675
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,392
We were both sent up here.

676
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:15,817
That's right. And it wasn't easy...

677
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,904
...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

678
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:26,036
This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

679
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:33,168
Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

680
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,588
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

681
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,591
I've got to go, Father.

682
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,267
I'll see you in the Kitchen.

683
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:52,645
I'm counting on you.

684
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:57,275
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

685
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:02,155
Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

686
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:06,951
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

687
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,040
You're gonna be okay.

688
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,132
I didn't want to let him go.

689
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:24,010
I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

690
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,187
A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

691
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,231
...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

692
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:38,733
There were other cries, too.

693
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,861
These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

694
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,157
They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

695
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,953
Those cries can change
the course of a life.

696
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,581
They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

697
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:56,918
On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

698
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,337
...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

699
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,940
I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

700
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:22,819
There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

701
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:27,657
This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

702
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,497
I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

703
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:36,666
Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

704
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,260
-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

705
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:50,263
No. You did a great
job on your book report.

706
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,352
You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

707
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:58,855
It's my favorite.
I like it more since I've been here.

708
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,273
Why is that?

709
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:05,487
It's like...he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

710
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,158
Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

711
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,202
And he learned from it.

712
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:16,498
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

713
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,960
-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

714
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:24,673
You got a copy of the book at home?

715
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,175
I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

716
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,511
No, it's not the same thing.

717
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,514
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

718
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,350
I've got something for you.

719
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:38,561
I thought you might like to have it.

720
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:40,522
Are you serious?

721
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,525
Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

722
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,611
-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

723
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,114
You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

724
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,365
It's been a while.

725
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:54,911
-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

726
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,748
That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

727
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:01,001
You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

728
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:03,294
Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

729
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,213
...think the Count can
hold their attention.

730
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,715
He's got a shot.

731
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:08,842
Any particular section
I should read from?

732
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:12,262
That's easy...the part where
he escapes from prison.

733
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,778
There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

734
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:40,832
It was only a game...just a touch
football game, nothing more.

735
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,418
But a game I wish we
had never played.

736
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:48,298
Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

737
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,301
Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

738
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,511
We had a 2 hour practice.

739
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,638
It didn't matter much.

740
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:59,017
We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

741
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,144
Who's the toughest guy here?

742
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,355
How do you mean, tough?

743
00:51:03,855 --> 00:51:05,523
Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

744
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,692
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

745
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:13,156
Michael saw an opening...a chance
to bring the game to our level.

746
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:17,327
Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

747
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:22,248
Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

748
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,169
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

749
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,588
I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

750
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:30,382
...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

751
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:31,216
Why?

752
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:32,550
Look man...

753
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:34,552
...guards stay clear of me, all right?

754
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:36,221
They stay back and let me do my time.

755
00:51:36,554 --> 00:51:38,390
If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

756
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:40,183
...they just might change my cushion.

757
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,561
I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

758
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,063
You do every day.

759
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:49,067
-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

760
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:55,281
They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

761
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:56,700
You're just an animal to them.

762
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:00,537
-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

763
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:03,415
And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

764
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,458
Then why, white boy, why?

765
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:10,005
To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

766
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,009
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

767
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,344
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:17,679
I call heads.

769
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,809
He called heads.
It is a head.

770
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:25,687
Let's go.

771
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:39,284
You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

772
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,005
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

773
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,675
We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

774
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:57,344
This shit feels good.

775
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:05,352
Fuck!

776
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,777
Get the fuck off me!

777
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,874
Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

778
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:33,546
For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

779
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:36,091
...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

780
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:38,385
...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

781
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,805
...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

782
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:45,892
For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

783
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:06,246
Rizzo! Rizzo!

784
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:21,970
Rizzo...Rizzo.

785
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,850
Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

786
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:33,106
For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

787
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:38,111
It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

788
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:43,199
I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

789
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:48,038
Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain...suffering his own demons.

790
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:49,789
Rizzo was there, too.

791
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,502
I had lost any sense of time.

792
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,544
I thought you'd never wake up.

793
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,214
I thought I'd never want to.

794
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:42,759
John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

795
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:47,972
How are they?
They're alive.

796
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:50,767
Who isn't?

797
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:53,687
Rizzo.

798
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:57,565
They killed him?

799
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:03,780
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

800
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,120
Rizzo was dead because of us.

801
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,540
We made him think that going
up against the guards...

802
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:15,041
...in a meaningless football game...

803
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:18,795
...had some value...that it would
give us a reason to go on.

804
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,673
Once again, we were wrong.

805
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,177
Did they give you
your release date yet?

806
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:27,679
Nokes had a letter from the warden.

807
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,390
Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up....

808
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:32,392
When do you figure?

809
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:36,396
End of spring, early
summer or something.

810
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,024
I wish we were coming with you.

811
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:42,402
It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

812
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,740
No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

813
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:52,120
When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

814
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:53,747
Shave a month or two off.

815
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:56,583
-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

816
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:00,003
Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

817
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,255
I don't want anybody to know.

818
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:06,760
Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

819
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:09,262
...not my mother. Nobody.

820
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,432
I don't either.

821
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:14,768
I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

822
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,146
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

823
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,858
Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

824
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:25,111
Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

825
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:31,451
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

826
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:34,996
So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

827
00:57:35,997 --> 00:57:37,332
The truth stays with us.

828
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:42,337
I want to be able to sleep one night...

829
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,467
...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

830
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:55,183
If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

831
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,647
Someday, John, I promise.

832
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,834
I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

833
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:23,586
I was given four copies
of my release form.

834
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:26,256
The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

835
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:30,301
I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

836
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,971
...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

837
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:35,807
You should be asleep.

838
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:41,104
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

839
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:46,109
I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

840
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:48,111
I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

841
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:49,738
I'm not working those kind of hours.

842
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:51,281
Yeah, did you put in for it?

843
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:52,741
I put in for it!

844
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:54,492
Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

845
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:58,329
I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

846
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,458
A part of all of us was
left there that night.

847
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,836
That night will never be
removed from my mind.

848
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,966
The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

849
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:13,636
My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

850
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:02,977
At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

851
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:07,065
The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names.

852
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:10,110
They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

853
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:11,695
They were also its deadliest.

854
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,783
The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

855
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,452
He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

856
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:22,956
He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

857
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,127
He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

858
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:30,422
He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

859
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:34,718
The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

860
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:37,053
...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

861
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:41,766
In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

862
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,061
...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

863
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:51,192
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

864
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:54,946
-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

865
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:56,740
It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get....

866
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:58,116
They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

867
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:01,453
He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

868
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:04,330
He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

869
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:08,168
Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

870
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,587
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

871
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,092
Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

872
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:20,847
You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

873
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:24,517
...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

874
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:25,935
Sure thing.

875
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:35,904
The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

876
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:39,908
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

877
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:41,659
You get my meaning?

878
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:01,846
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

879
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:33,837
Can I help you with something, chief?

880
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:40,093
Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

881
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:30,143
I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

882
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:34,314
...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

883
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,441
Is that okay by you?

884
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:41,905
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

885
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,834
Motherfucker.

886
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:22,946
That's him.

887
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:24,656
Are you fucking kidding me?

888
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:28,910
Bingo!

889
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:55,770
This is amazing.

890
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:58,606
Hello...it's been a long time!

891
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:01,443
Who the fuck are you guys?

892
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,407
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

893
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:10,994
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

894
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:15,248
You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

895
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:18,126
You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

896
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:20,795
...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

897
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,422
That seems like a waste.

898
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,591
I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

899
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,509
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

900
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,100
I can see how he might forget us.

901
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,687
You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

902
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,981
It's a little harder for us to forget.

903
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:42,609
You gave us so much more to remember.

904
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,364
You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

905
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:52,118
Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

906
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:04,506
Yeah, that's right.

907
01:06:11,304 --> 01:06:12,639
That was a long time ago.

908
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:16,935
So how you been?

909
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,437
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

910
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:22,065
So, what do you want?

911
01:06:22,899 --> 01:06:26,236
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

912
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:33,326
You ordered the meat loaf.

913
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,956
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

914
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,083
You fucked up.

915
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:58,226
Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

916
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:04,441
All of you...scared shitless.
But l...

917
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:09,821
...l tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

918
01:07:09,863 --> 01:07:13,491
I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

919
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:15,160
...fucking and beating up little boys.

920
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:17,620
You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

921
01:07:18,204 --> 01:07:19,539
You're gonna burn in hell.

922
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:20,665
Yeah, after you.

923
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:27,630
Did that hurt, Nokes?

924
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:09,422
Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

925
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:23,353
John Reilly, how do you plead?

926
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:24,896
Not guilty, Your Honor.

927
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:26,731
Thomas Marcano?

928
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,401
Not guilty, Your Honor.

929
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:33,655
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

930
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:38,284
In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

931
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:41,788
...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

932
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:43,957
...but the relationship
had been altered.

933
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:49,295
We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

934
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:51,506
...that would force us to
deal with the past.

935
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:08,356
One down, Shakes, one down.

936
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:11,192
One what?

937
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,781
One Sean Nokes.

938
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:18,825
Nokes?

939
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,376
At the time of Nokes' shooting,

940
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:31,379
Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

941
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:34,591
I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

942
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:36,384
Then, he hung up.

943
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,640
-So, what did they say?
-What?

944
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:44,142
John and Tommy, what'd they say?

945
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:45,643
It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

946
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:48,563
Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

947
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:51,816
-John did.
-Yeah?

948
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:53,693
What did he say?

949
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:57,155
He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

950
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,702
I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

951
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:05,372
It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

952
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:08,291
Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

953
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,919
-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

954
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:12,545
Perfect for what?

955
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,426
Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

956
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:19,594
-Me?
-Yeah.

957
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,598
I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

958
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:24,724
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

959
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:30,605
Get some coffee?

960
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:32,607
Let's take a walk.

961
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,453
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

962
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:48,331
What, are you fucking nuts?

963
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,208
Just hear me out.

964
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,378
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

965
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:54,879
I'm not taking this case to win.

966
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:58,091
I'm taking this case to lose.

967
01:10:59,509 --> 01:11:00,343
What does that mean?

968
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:04,347
It means it's payback time.

969
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:09,894
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

970
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:14,024
It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but...here it is.

971
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:18,153
And you and l, we can finish it.

972
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:20,280
Finish what, Mikey?

973
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:24,492
You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

974
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:28,413
I don't know...ten years ago.

975
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:31,916
You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

976
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:37,255
I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

977
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:40,967
Payback time.

978
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,137
It's our time.

979
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,181
What are you saying, Mike?

980
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,934
I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

981
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,730
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

982
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:56,941
Let's walk.

983
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,280
So, I asked for the case.

984
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,324
I told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused...

985
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,493
...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

986
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:07,660
They bought it.

987
01:12:08,536 --> 01:12:10,622
And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

988
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:13,917
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

989
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,544
We were never at Wilkinson's.

990
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,676
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

991
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:24,969
Bring it all down.

992
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:28,973
Adam Styler, plain-clothes cop,
works narcotics in Queens.

993
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:32,769
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

994
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:34,604
Other personal information there.

995
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:38,274
Henry Addison now works for the Mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

996
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:40,485
He's a Community Outreach
Director in Brooklyn.

997
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:44,781
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

998
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:48,201
Ralph Ferguson works in a Social
Service agency in Long Island.

999
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,869
How long have you been
working on this, Mike?

1000
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:52,163
He's recently divorced, got
one child, and on weekends...

1001
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:53,998
...teaches Catholic Sunday school.

1002
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:55,792
Well, he seems clean then, right?

1003
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:57,877
That's exactly why I
want the piece of shit.

1004
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:01,297
The plan is to call Ferguson
in as a character witness.

1005
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,633
Get him talking about his
best friend, Sean Nokes.

1006
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:07,804
Once I got him on the stand, I'm
gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

1007
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,892
Mike, are you sure you
want to go this way?

1008
01:13:16,312 --> 01:13:18,314
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

1009
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,318
Do you still sleep with the light on?

1010
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:31,119
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

1011
01:13:31,536 --> 01:13:33,121
No, it'll play better in
court if they don't know.

1012
01:13:46,217 --> 01:13:49,304
The 'not guilty' verdict had to be a
verdict that no one would dare question.

1013
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:52,599
Danny Snyder was to remain as
Tommy and John's attorney.

1014
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:56,061
Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen...

1015
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,063
...to deliver information and keep quiet.

1016
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:00,607
Both were skills the Neighborhood
had in abundance.

1017
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,443
We'd set up a simple
method of communication.

1018
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:06,446
If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work...

1019
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:08,782
...for me to call my non-existent
girlfriend, "Gloria".

1020
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:12,827
If I needed to get word to Michael, I'd
have someone from the neighborhood...

1021
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:14,662
...pick up an early edition
of the New York Times...

1022
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,999
...write the word "Edmund" in the upper
right hand corner of the Metro section...

1023
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,001
...and drop it in front
of Michael's apartment.

1024
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:26,174
For this plan to succeed...

1025
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:29,260
...we needed total secrecy of
the only people we completely trusted.

1026
01:14:29,886 --> 01:14:31,888
The plan depended on
keeping Michael alive...

1027
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:34,474
...which meant that word had to get
to John and Tommy's killing crew...

1028
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:35,850
...that he was not an open target.

1029
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:39,729
After this night, Michael would
not be available to any of us.

1030
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:42,148
The only time we would see
him would be in court.

1031
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:44,359
-That's it?
-Not quite.

1032
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:48,363
We've got four witnesses who saw the
shooting and are willing to testify.

1033
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:49,489
Gotta get that number down.

1034
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:52,033
-I'll talk to King Benny.
-Good.

1035
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,705
I can handle two, but...
you gotta get us one for our side.

1036
01:14:57,205 --> 01:14:59,165
-One of what?
-One witness.

1037
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,669
A witness who'll put John & Tommy
elsewhere on the night of the murder.

1038
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:05,046
A witness they can't touch.

1039
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:08,008
Don't they have a name for that?

1040
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,301
A judge would call it perjury.

1041
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:13,179
And what are we calling it?

1042
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:14,681
A favor.

1043
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:18,679
Get up!

1044
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:23,892
-Tony!
-Yeah, King?

1045
01:15:24,309 --> 01:15:26,103
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

1046
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,021
Who? Danny Snyder, the lawyer?

1047
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:29,857
You know more than one Danny Snyder?

1048
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,568
Bring me the one you know.

1049
01:15:51,587 --> 01:15:55,924
I can't do this now, you gotta know that.
It's been a long time for me.

1050
01:15:58,427 --> 01:16:01,764
You need somebody younger, you know.
Somebody like I used to be.

1051
01:16:02,306 --> 01:16:03,474
Younger is not better.

1052
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:07,770
Doesn't have experience, doesn't
know its way around a courthouse.

1053
01:16:07,978 --> 01:16:09,813
Yeah, I'm lucky I can
find the courthouse.

1054
01:16:11,607 --> 01:16:15,110
I had only four cases last year.
You know how many I won?

1055
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:18,655
None. That's how many. None.

1056
01:16:19,948 --> 01:16:23,035
In two of them, I think the...

1057
01:16:23,285 --> 01:16:24,870
...the jury blamed me personally.

1058
01:16:25,454 --> 01:16:26,455
They must've been innocent.

1059
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:30,876
It's tough to get
innocent men off a rap.

1060
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:33,504
I wasn't even planning on
going to court with this one.

1061
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,632
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could and walk away.

1062
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:39,551
I wasn't planning on
taking this to trial, sir.

1063
01:16:39,885 --> 01:16:41,887
Well, your plans have been changed.

1064
01:16:42,346 --> 01:16:46,266
Well, I am afraid that I'll make a
mistake and say the wrong thing...

1065
01:16:48,519 --> 01:16:51,563
...make a wrong turn somewhere.
And you don't want to take that risk.

1066
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:53,232
Life is risk.

1067
01:16:53,524 --> 01:16:54,400
I'm sorry.

1068
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:56,068
Life is risk.

1069
01:16:56,652 --> 01:16:57,653
Life is a risk?

1070
01:17:02,324 --> 01:17:03,826
I haven't been in here before.

1071
01:17:06,036 --> 01:17:07,371
What do you need me to do?

1072
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:11,875
You're gonna be given the
answers and the questions.

1073
01:17:13,043 --> 01:17:16,505
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1074
01:17:17,715 --> 01:17:19,049
Is it in English?

1075
01:17:19,216 --> 01:17:22,136
Just don't drift, don't drink,
and don't lose.

1076
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:24,888
What if I do lose?

1077
01:17:25,264 --> 01:17:27,391
Then you'll go down for the dirt nap.

1078
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,394
Never heard that expression before.

1079
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:33,439
Dirt nap.

1080
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:39,778
I'm not really cut out for this anymore.
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus...

1081
01:17:40,487 --> 01:17:43,115
...and sues, I like that.

1082
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:47,077
Some lady slips in a supermarket...
I'm with her.

1083
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:48,746
The discussion is over.

1084
01:17:49,038 --> 01:17:52,833
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

1085
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,168
It was once.

1086
01:17:55,252 --> 01:17:56,837
Before you let the drink lead.

1087
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:02,176
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1088
01:18:02,843 --> 01:18:05,387
You've got nothing to lose...
just like the rest of us.

1089
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:09,183
I don't want to be a burden
to you, but l...

1090
01:18:10,017 --> 01:18:14,396
...along with my alcohol problem,
I have a slight drug problem.

1091
01:18:14,563 --> 01:18:15,564
I mean, nothing big.

1092
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,149
Go away.

1093
01:18:28,202 --> 01:18:29,828
Within days of Michael taking the case...

1094
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:32,081
...the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.

1095
01:18:32,706 --> 01:18:35,918
The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.

1096
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:39,713
"Traitor" and "gutter rat" were
heard up and down the avenue.

1097
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,049
But there was never to be
a death move against him.

1098
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:46,512
The hit on Michael Sullivan, if there was
one, could only come from King Benny.

1099
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:49,390
The underground word...
the only one that mattered...

1100
01:18:49,598 --> 01:18:51,934
...had spread through the streets with
the speed of a late-night bullet.

1101
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,941
King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.

1102
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:03,904
"Sleepers" was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.

1103
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:16,208
You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

1104
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,628
Need your help, fat man.
Need a big favor.

1105
01:19:19,712 --> 01:19:20,838
I'll be outside.

1106
01:19:21,296 --> 01:19:22,339
King Benny been to see you?

1107
01:19:22,548 --> 01:19:23,674
Oh, my goodness!

1108
01:19:24,258 --> 01:19:26,385
What a fucking thing we put together!

1109
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:31,014
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1110
01:19:31,348 --> 01:19:33,851
Fucking paper boy,
making like Dick Tracy.

1111
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:37,521
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing!

1112
01:19:38,814 --> 01:19:41,608
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1113
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:44,361
Fucking General Custer has
a better shot at a walk!

1114
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:46,280
There's no connection
with the guard and us.

1115
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,323
The cops think it's a
drug-related homicide.

1116
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:50,325
It's just we need you to
pull a few strings, fat man.

1117
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:53,662
You know, if you get caught on this,
you're looking straight at serious.

1118
01:19:54,163 --> 01:19:55,998
I'm talking real jail.
The big house....

1119
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:05,299
They are not good boys any more.

1120
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:09,470
They're killers now.
Cold as stone.

1121
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,264
I know.

1122
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,768
I know what they were, and I know
what they are, and it's not about that.

1123
01:20:15,934 --> 01:20:19,563
It's not worth it, throwing
away life just to get even.

1124
01:20:21,023 --> 01:20:23,025
You and the lawyer have
a chance to get out.

1125
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:24,359
To get out the right way.

1126
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,029
There's no choice...not for us.

1127
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:33,202
On occasion, I'd have
dinner with Carol.

1128
01:20:33,744 --> 01:20:37,081
She still lived in the neighborhood and
was a social worker in the South Bronx.

1129
01:20:37,623 --> 01:20:40,292
Her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years.

1130
01:20:41,377 --> 01:20:44,421
Whenever we went out as a group, Carol
would walk between Michael and John...

1131
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,839
...grasping their arms...

1132
01:20:47,216 --> 01:20:49,385
...in step between the lawyer
and the killer.

1133
01:20:49,468 --> 01:20:53,097
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1134
01:20:54,431 --> 01:20:56,058
Would you settle for a
couple of beers, Carol?

1135
01:20:57,935 --> 01:20:59,728
If that's your best offer.

1136
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:02,731
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1137
01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:04,942
Deal.

1138
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:11,990
You look tired.

1139
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:13,534
Thank you.

1140
01:21:14,576 --> 01:21:16,578
They don't give you time to
sleep on this new job of yours?

1141
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:22,626
So, how much do you know?

1142
01:21:24,002 --> 01:21:25,295
Just what the neighborhood says.

1143
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:28,173
And what I read in papers like yours.

1144
01:21:29,174 --> 01:21:30,509
What does the neighborhood say?

1145
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:32,636
That they're gonna put
Johnny and Tommy away.

1146
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:34,972
That their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

1147
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,140
You believe that?

1148
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:37,891
It's hard not to, Shakes.

1149
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:41,770
Unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1150
01:21:43,105 --> 01:21:45,107
-He did take the case.
-What else is there to say?

1151
01:21:48,152 --> 01:21:49,236
You know Michael very well...

1152
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:51,947
...maybe even better than I do.

1153
01:21:52,197 --> 01:21:54,783
Yeah, I thought I did.
Now, I don't know.

1154
01:21:54,992 --> 01:21:56,660
-You do know.
-I don't know!

1155
01:21:57,536 --> 01:21:59,121
He went in there, and
he asked for the case.

1156
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:01,415
Now, you tell me, what the
hell kind of friend is that?

1157
01:22:02,374 --> 01:22:03,375
The best kind.

1158
01:22:04,793 --> 01:22:06,837
The kind who'll throw away
everything to help his friends.

1159
01:22:11,175 --> 01:22:12,176
What are you telling me, Shakes?

1160
01:22:14,053 --> 01:22:17,514
You know this neighborhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1161
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:19,516
Why should this be any different?

1162
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:27,066
I'm hungry.

1163
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:29,610
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1164
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:35,032
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1165
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:38,118
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1166
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:41,789
And he just...he shut down.

1167
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:45,918
Couldn't touch him...
couldn't even breathe on him.

1168
01:22:49,046 --> 01:22:49,963
I thought it was me.

1169
01:22:52,383 --> 01:22:54,259
After a while, it just
gets easier to let it go.

1170
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:56,553
Do you still love him?

1171
01:22:57,012 --> 01:22:58,180
I don't think about it, Shakes.

1172
01:23:00,057 --> 01:23:02,184
If I did, I'd say 'yes.'

1173
01:23:03,185 --> 01:23:04,061
But you're with John now.

1174
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:08,982
Yeah...as much as
anybody can be with John.

1175
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,070
The man I know is not
the boy you remember.

1176
01:23:13,278 --> 01:23:14,446
None of us are.

1177
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:17,449
But there's something
special about John.

1178
01:23:19,368 --> 01:23:21,453
You just have to look a
little harder to see it.

1179
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:28,293
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1180
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:30,671
-Me?
-Yeah.

1181
01:23:32,214 --> 01:23:33,340
Cause you were Mikey's girl.

1182
01:23:36,051 --> 01:23:37,136
He got to you first.

1183
01:23:37,594 --> 01:23:38,762
And after Mikey?

1184
01:23:39,763 --> 01:23:40,764
I think it was Tommy's turn.

1185
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,058
Fuck you!

1186
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:47,396
Because...

1187
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:50,607
...l didn't think you'd say 'yes.'

1188
01:23:57,156 --> 01:23:58,824
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1189
01:24:00,492 --> 01:24:01,452
You were wrong.

1190
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:10,002
What? Go ahead and say it.

1191
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:15,799
You work at Social Services, you
got files. You got access to files.

1192
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,677
And from time to time, we're
gonna need some information.

1193
01:24:18,844 --> 01:24:19,928
Yeah, sure...whatever...

1194
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:22,473
Wait. What?

1195
01:24:22,848 --> 01:24:24,808
Well, what do you want?
You want information?

1196
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,019
You want me to get the files?
I'll get the files!

1197
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:28,687
What do you want?

1198
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,195
You still visit John?

1199
01:24:37,029 --> 01:24:38,906
Yeah, once a week for about an hour.

1200
01:24:38,947 --> 01:24:41,116
-Good.
-Good?

1201
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:44,036
Yeah, good. Just don't tell
him that you've seen me.

1202
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,871
Just don't tell him anything.

1203
01:24:45,954 --> 01:24:48,540
I mean, the more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

1204
01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:51,919
Shakes, what is this about?

1205
01:24:54,797 --> 01:24:57,466
You want a Rolls Royce?
You don't come here.

1206
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,260
You go to England or wherever
the fuck they make it.

1207
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:02,930
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1208
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,932
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1209
01:25:05,307 --> 01:25:09,103
But if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere, or...

1210
01:25:09,436 --> 01:25:13,107
...some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about, there's only one place to go.

1211
01:25:13,649 --> 01:25:17,778
Right here, Hell's Kitchen!
It is the lost and found of shit!

1212
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:21,657
They lose it and we find it!
Forget about it, man.

1213
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:26,620
Now, you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1214
01:25:27,621 --> 01:25:29,331
Two others changed their minds.

1215
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,626
-Which two?
-The suits at the bar.

1216
01:25:34,503 --> 01:25:36,588
So that still leaves the
couple in the booth?

1217
01:25:36,672 --> 01:25:38,090
For now.

1218
01:25:39,508 --> 01:25:41,301
Everything else falling into place?

1219
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:46,682
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1220
01:25:47,683 --> 01:25:48,350
I know.

1221
01:25:53,564 --> 01:25:54,982
When you were sent away,

1222
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:58,819
I was always sorry I
couldn't do more for you.

1223
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,580
I didn't know you liked
pigeons so much.

1224
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:11,999
I like anything that don't talk.

1225
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:16,837
Michael's vision on where he wanted
this case to go was very clear.

1226
01:26:17,379 --> 01:26:18,547
He was aiming for guilty...

1227
01:26:18,797 --> 01:26:21,467
...a charge of guilty against
the Wilkinson Home for Boys...

1228
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:25,137
...against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison, and Ralph Ferguson.

1229
01:26:25,429 --> 01:26:28,932
I will present to you evidence and offer
into account testimony to prove that.

1230
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:31,685
I will place them at
the scene of the crime.

1231
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:33,854
I will bring witnesses to the stand
who will confirm...

1232
01:26:34,104 --> 01:26:36,356
...that they were there
on that deadly night.

1233
01:26:37,274 --> 01:26:41,236
I will present enough evidence that
you can then go into a jury room...

1234
01:26:41,403 --> 01:26:44,823
...and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

1235
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,950
I'm sure you all know what that means...

1236
01:26:47,034 --> 01:26:49,411
...since you probably watch
as much television as I do.

1237
01:26:52,456 --> 01:26:56,251
John...John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1238
01:26:56,418 --> 01:26:59,755
...are two innocent pawns,
quickly arrested and just...

1239
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,258
...as quickly prosecuted on the...

1240
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:05,636
...slightest threads of evidence.

1241
01:27:05,928 --> 01:27:08,597
Look on the bright side, he
seems to know their names.

1242
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,599
I don't have to tell you. You and I
know how these things work.

1243
01:27:20,484 --> 01:27:21,819
It's nice when you come around.

1244
01:27:25,364 --> 01:27:27,032
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty!

1245
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:28,909
Take it.

1246
01:27:28,992 --> 01:27:30,327
No, no, she'll do it.

1247
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:40,504
How's work?

1248
01:27:43,257 --> 01:27:44,216
I'm still there.

1249
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:49,847
You know, Pop, l...

1250
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:52,975
...l went down to the courthouse.

1251
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,270
You know, I saw John and Tommy.

1252
01:27:57,312 --> 01:27:59,398
I started thinking back
to when we were young....

1253
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:00,399
Where's the chicken?

1254
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:05,654
So...?

1255
01:28:07,406 --> 01:28:10,409
Nothing. I was just thinking.

1256
01:28:12,244 --> 01:28:13,662
You're doing good, right?

1257
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:16,915
Yeah. Doing good.

1258
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,208
Good.

1259
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,127
What the hell do these things do?

1260
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:03,796
They're for praying.

1261
01:29:04,546 --> 01:29:05,297
Look at all this shit!

1262
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,883
What, does your mother think you're
in the fucking army or something?

1263
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,843
Ain't none of it on the approved list.

1264
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,637
I'm sure your Mommy
got a copy of that list.

1265
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:13,347
My mother can't speak English that well.

1266
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:16,683
Don't blame us for your fucking
mother being stupid, all right?

1267
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:23,190
When are you gonna let us hear you pray?

1268
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:36,328
Maybe he needs something to pray for.

1269
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,330
Put your hands on the table
and lay them flat.

1270
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:41,500
Spread your legs.

1271
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:45,212
Now start thinking up some prayers.

1272
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:55,806
We don't hear no praying.

1273
01:29:56,056 --> 01:29:58,726
You better start, or Styler might
lose his baton up your ass.

1274
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:00,561
Blessed art thou among women...

1275
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:02,438
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus....

1276
01:30:02,521 --> 01:30:03,814
Pray nice and loud!

1277
01:30:07,609 --> 01:30:09,236
Fucker, pray! Come on, now!

1278
01:30:11,822 --> 01:30:14,241
-Louder.
-Hail Mary...

1279
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,660
Louder, fucker!

1280
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:20,456
Pray like you're in fucking church!

1281
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:33,594
Sorry I'm late.
I lost all track of time.

1282
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:36,764
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

1283
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:38,932
But I want you to come along.
So, you want to just go...

1284
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,020
-Where are we going?
-To his place.

1285
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,980
-Where is it?
-It's in the rectory.

1286
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:46,523
No. Shakes!

1287
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:49,443
-Just trust me.
-I can't.

1288
01:30:55,991 --> 01:30:57,117
How was court today?

1289
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:02,623
Like the first round of a fight...
everybody just feeling each other out.

1290
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,376
How did the boys look?

1291
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:07,711
Like they wished they
were someplace else.

1292
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,341
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

1293
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:16,220
It's not too late, Father.

1294
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,475
We still have a chance to bring in
a couple of stray sheep...

1295
01:31:22,851 --> 01:31:23,727
...one more chance.

1296
01:31:26,688 --> 01:31:27,815
Is that chance legal?

1297
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,443
Last chances never are.

1298
01:31:32,528 --> 01:31:33,445
King Benny behind this?

1299
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:37,866
He's in on it, but...
he's not calling the shots.

1300
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:38,867
Who is?

1301
01:31:40,911 --> 01:31:41,578
Michael.

1302
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,832
I should've smelled it.

1303
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:48,210
The minute he went for the case,
I should've figured something was up.

1304
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:49,962
It's a good plan.

1305
01:31:50,462 --> 01:31:53,590
Michael's got it all covered...
just about every base you look at.

1306
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:55,426
He's got it covered.

1307
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:56,635
Not every base.

1308
01:31:57,928 --> 01:31:59,763
You're short something, or else
you wouldn't be here.

1309
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:02,266
You don't shit a shitter, right?

1310
01:32:02,474 --> 01:32:03,434
That's right.

1311
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:06,854
So, what is it?

1312
01:32:06,937 --> 01:32:08,272
Where do you come up short?

1313
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:11,692
Witness.

1314
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,154
We need somebody
to take the stand and say...

1315
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:17,573
...they were with John and
Tommy on the night of the murder.

1316
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,658
So, you figured if you had a
priest, it would be perfect?

1317
01:32:20,909 --> 01:32:22,411
Not just any priest.

1318
01:32:38,635 --> 01:32:43,307
You're asking me...
you're asking me to lie.

1319
01:32:44,641 --> 01:32:47,519
You're asking me to swear
to God and then lie.

1320
01:32:48,812 --> 01:32:50,773
I'm asking you to save two of your boys.

1321
01:32:56,403 --> 01:32:59,740
-Did they kill that guard?
-Yes.

1322
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:04,828
So what they said is true?
They walked in and they killed him?

1323
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:06,455
Yes.

1324
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,501
They killed him exactly like that.

1325
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,756
I think I need a drink.

1326
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:19,385
Anyone want a drink?

1327
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:39,655
This is some favor you're asking me.

1328
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:42,157
We know that.

1329
01:33:43,325 --> 01:33:44,827
No, I don't think you do know.

1330
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,789
You said, if there was ever
anything really important...

1331
01:33:48,872 --> 01:33:50,582
...l could come to you, ask you.

1332
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:54,461
I was thinking more along
the lines of Yankee tickets.

1333
01:33:56,922 --> 01:34:01,385
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

1334
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:06,181
What about the life that was taken,
Shakes? What's that worth?

1335
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:09,184
To me? Nothing.

1336
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,481
Why not?
Tell me.

1337
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:25,534
He was a guard at Wilkinsons.

1338
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:30,080
All right.

1339
01:34:30,622 --> 01:34:34,001
If Father Bobby was gonna be involved, he
deserved to know what he's getting into.

1340
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,880
If he wasn't, I trusted that the truth
would go no further than this room.

1341
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:41,341
I thought that Carol
needed to know, as well.

1342
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,012
Jesus Christ, we were just boys.
We were not tough.

1343
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:50,142
They held us down.

1344
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:57,733
I told him about the torture,
the beatings, and the rapes.

1345
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:00,569
I told him about the four
frightened boys who prayed...

1346
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:03,072
...to Father Bobby's God
for help that never came.

1347
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:05,199
I told them everything.

1348
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:08,285
We can't fight anymore.
They just took it all.

1349
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:14,041
John used to wail at night, hear
it all the way down the hall.

1350
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:19,546
You know he wanted to be a priest,
John wanted to be a priest.

1351
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:27,930
Then he pulls his pants down.
I didn't even know what a blow job was.

1352
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:35,145
I just blacked out what I could.
It was like I couldn't even breathe.

1353
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:39,400
Then...l started to choke.

1354
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:41,902
He was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head.

1355
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:45,906
Then I blacked out.

1356
01:35:48,575 --> 01:35:52,955
But I do remember when, for fun,
they'd take us down in the basement...

1357
01:35:54,164 --> 01:35:56,291
...tie two or three of us together...

1358
01:35:56,375 --> 01:36:00,045
...and make the other watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked'em.

1359
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,062
I got a decision to make.

1360
01:36:22,192 --> 01:36:23,819
I only pray it's the right one.

1361
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:29,241
It will be, Father...
whichever way you go.

1362
01:36:35,205 --> 01:36:36,165
Good night.

1363
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:47,426
So, you were sitting down,
you were having dinner...

1364
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,429
...and two men entered
McHale's, correct?

1365
01:36:51,346 --> 01:36:54,600
Did you see them as they approached
the table where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

1366
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:56,143
I noticed it, yes.

1367
01:36:56,643 --> 01:36:58,145
Did you hear what
was said between them?

1368
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,107
-Did you see them pull out their guns?
-No.

1369
01:37:02,357 --> 01:37:05,986
-Did you hear the shots?
-Yes, I heard the shots.

1370
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:10,324
And what did they do? What was
their behavior after the shooting?

1371
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:14,078
They walked out of McHale's
as if nothing had happened.

1372
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:19,166
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

1373
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:23,295
Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1374
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:26,715
-Are you positive?
-Yes, very positive.

1375
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:30,052
Are the two men you saw at
McHale's in this room today?

1376
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:31,053
Yes, they are.

1377
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,055
Could you point them
out to the jury, please?

1378
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:35,599
They're sitting right over there.

1379
01:37:36,975 --> 01:37:40,729
Your Honor, will the record reflect that
Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants...

1380
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:43,941
...John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
as the two men in question.

1381
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:45,067
Noted.

1382
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:46,944
Thank you. No further questions.

1383
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:50,447
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1384
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,116
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

1385
01:37:52,574 --> 01:37:53,450
Good morning.

1386
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:57,162
I just have a few questions. I won't
take too much of your time, Mrs. Salinas.

1387
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:02,751
You stated that you only had wine to
drink with dinner. Is that correct?

1388
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:07,423
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1389
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,259
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1390
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:13,095
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1391
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:15,180
What do you mean "prior"?

1392
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:19,393
At lunch...maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch?

1393
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:20,769
Yes, I did.

1394
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,105
What did you have to drink?

1395
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,151
I went shopping, and I stopped
at a place on Madison Avenue...

1396
01:38:27,317 --> 01:38:28,944
-...for some lunch.
-See, I didn't ask you where you went.

1397
01:38:29,111 --> 01:38:30,821
I asked you what you
had to drink at lunch?

1398
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,283
-A martini.
-And what else?

1399
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:38,620
Probably some wine.

1400
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:43,709
Yes, and how many glasses of
wine did you have to drink?

1401
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,963
One glass, maybe two.

1402
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:51,550
-Closer to two?
-Yes, probably two glasses.

1403
01:38:57,639 --> 01:38:59,058
It's like pulling teeth.

1404
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:04,063
I should've pinned the
questions to his shirt.

1405
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,276
And tell me, then at dinner you...

1406
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:10,360
Strike that.

1407
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:21,163
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1408
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:22,331
Objection, Your Honor!

1409
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,918
What Mrs. Salinas did on the
day of the murder...

1410
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,379
...has nothing to do with what she
saw on the night of the murder.

1411
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,214
How much she had to
drink does, Your Honor.

1412
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:31,382
Overruled!

1413
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:36,887
Mrs. Salinas, what time
did you have lunch?

1414
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,555
About one-thirty.

1415
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:39,932
And what did you have for lunch?

1416
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:43,519
It was a while ago.
Probably a salad.

1417
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,646
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1418
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,899
A martini, two glasses of wine
and a salad, is that correct?

1419
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:50,526
Yes, that's right.

1420
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:55,489
And then you had wine at dinner,
about 6 hours later, is that correct?

1421
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:56,740
Yes, that's right.

1422
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:58,534
How much wine did you have to drink...

1423
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:01,120
...by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHale's?

1424
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:05,416
-Two glasses.
-Would you say that four glasses of wine...

1425
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:09,586
...and a martini within a 6-hour
period is a lot for you to drink?

1426
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,505
Yes, it is.

1427
01:40:17,636 --> 01:40:21,974
Have you ever heard a gun fired,
prior to the night in question?

1428
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,770
How would you describe the sound?

1429
01:40:27,312 --> 01:40:29,982
It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1430
01:40:31,316 --> 01:40:35,320
-Did the sound frighten you?
-Very much.

1431
01:40:35,487 --> 01:40:38,157
Did you close your eyes?

1432
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:42,870
At first...until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1433
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:47,166
Did you think the men who were shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHale's?

1434
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:51,253
Well, I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been shot.

1435
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:56,008
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1436
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:58,552
Yes, I did.

1437
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,890
Yet, despite that fear, despite
that risk to your life...

1438
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:07,227
...you looked at their
faces as they left?

1439
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:09,938
-Yes, I did.
-Is that correct?

1440
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:12,357
Yes, I did.

1441
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:15,444
Did you look at their faces?
Did you really...

1442
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:19,448
...really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1443
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:23,202
I glanced at them when they
walked by, but I did see them!

1444
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:27,373
You...glanced?
You didn't look?

1445
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,625
I saw them!

1446
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:35,089
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.
You glanced at them through the eyes...

1447
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:40,094
...of a very frightened woman who
maybe had too much to drink.

1448
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,722
-Objection, Your Honor.
-There is no need, Your Honor.

1449
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:45,224
I have no further questions.

1450
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:47,851
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1451
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,607
It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.

1452
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:57,194
Frank Magicco worked out of
a homicide unit in Brooklyn.

1453
01:41:57,486 --> 01:42:00,489
He was a first grade detective with
an honest name and a solid reputation.

1454
01:42:01,156 --> 01:42:02,699
He was also King Benny's nephew.

1455
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,661
Nick Davenport
was with Internal Affairs.

1456
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,289
He was ambitious and wanted to make
captain before he hit forty.

1457
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,959
He knew the fastest way up
the track was to reel in a...

1458
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:14,878
...maximum amount of dirty cops
in a minimum amount of time.

1459
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:16,880
Frank, what is this shit?

1460
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,091
If I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1461
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:20,592
You make this one...

1462
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,803
...you're gonna be having breakfast
once a month with the Commissioner.

1463
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:26,473
You know, you got a real hard-on for this
Styler guy. What's your beef with him?

1464
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,809
-One more thing.
-I can't wait.

1465
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:33,647
It's simple. No one knows who fed you
this information. And I mean, nobody.

1466
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:34,857
How did you get it?

1467
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:38,360
It fell into my lap...just like
it's gonna fall into yours.

1468
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:46,994
Christ Almighty!

1469
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,086
You got everything in
here but a confession.

1470
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,838
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1471
01:42:58,213 --> 01:42:59,882
My preference is that
you beat it out of him.

1472
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:01,550
There's even surveillance photos.

1473
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,471
This piece of shit's pulling in about
five grand a month, ripping off pushers.

1474
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:06,972
Has been for about 3 years.

1475
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,183
-More like 4.
-He ain't gonna see 5.

1476
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,684
So, you got enough for conviction?

1477
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,895
That ain't up to me.
That's up to a jury.

1478
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:17,900
Show the jury this.

1479
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:21,987
What do you got there, Ness?

1480
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:24,782
About 3 weeks ago,
the body of a drug dealer...

1481
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:28,160
...named Indian Red Lpez was found
in an alley in Jackson Heights.

1482
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:30,579
Three bullets in his head,
nothing in his pockets.

1483
01:43:30,662 --> 01:43:31,580
I'm with you so far.

1484
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:34,500
This is the gun that killed him,
and these are the shells.

1485
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:38,087
What's behind door number 3?

1486
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,964
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

1487
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,304
-Hey, do me a favor, would you?
-What's that?

1488
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,473
If I ever make it onto your
shit list, give me a call.

1489
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:52,267
Give me a chance to apologize.

1490
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:56,897
So, you need anything else, you talk to
Frank. He knows how to get a hold of me.

1491
01:43:57,272 --> 01:44:00,401
Take care of yourself, kid.
Water gets choppy out your way.

1492
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:01,860
I'll do what I can.

1493
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:06,990
Hey, Ness...did you ever
think of becoming a cop?

1494
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:09,284
And leave the good guys?

1495
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,721
The body of Christ.

1496
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,288
The body of Christ.

1497
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,044
Michael had done all
that could be expected...

1498
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:03,047
...of an Assistant District Attorney
seeking a conviction.

1499
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:08,052
He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.

1500
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,971
He just never had the murder
weapon to present as evidence.

1501
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,390
And he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.

1502
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:17,603
The tension of his task,
the hours he was working...

1503
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:20,147
...and the uncertainty about
the outcome weighed heavily on him.

1504
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:21,690
Did you see their faces?

1505
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,943
Yes, I looked at them,
and they looked at me.

1506
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:26,153
Did they say anything to you?

1507
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:29,031
No, they just looked at me
and walked out of McHale's.

1508
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:31,366
Are you sure the two
defendants killed Sean Nokes?

1509
01:45:31,533 --> 01:45:32,659
I know they killed him.

1510
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:35,662
If the plan worked, it would
be everyone's success.

1511
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:38,374
If it failed, the fault
would fall to Michael.

1512
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:45,881
Father Bobby Carillo, the priest with
the best hook shot on the West Side...

1513
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,676
...remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder.

1514
01:45:50,636 --> 01:45:53,972
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1515
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,808
Why didn't you turn around, Mr. Carson?

1516
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:58,894
I was concerned for my
companion's safety.

1517
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,896
Mr. Carson, did the two individuals
threaten you in any way?

1518
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:05,025
Did they threaten anyone
in McHale's Restaurant...?

1519
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,195
I didn't see it, but I know it!

1520
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:11,031
If you didn't see the defendant
shoot the guard...

1521
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:13,367
...then how do you know it was
the defendant that shot him?

1522
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:38,350
So, what's the emergency?

1523
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,773
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
It's too risky.

1524
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,318
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

1525
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,196
Why?

1526
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,200
Shakes met with Father Bobby
2 weeks ago.

1527
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,871
-He hasn't heard from him since.
-It's not an overnight decision for him.

1528
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:06,170
-What if he doesn't testify?
-Then we got a very serious problem.

1529
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,271
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1530
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:29,234
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1531
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:31,278
He already has.

1532
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:33,739
What?!

1533
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:38,702
I...was with him when he
talked to Father Bobby.

1534
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,457
I heard everything, Michael.

1535
01:47:53,675 --> 01:47:54,760
So, you know.

1536
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:04,436
If only you told me.

1537
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:11,318
I think things could've been different.

1538
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,406
If you could've talked.

1539
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,621
Maybe...maybe we...

1540
01:48:26,834 --> 01:48:27,793
Maybe....

1541
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,779
Carmen, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1542
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:00,242
You still have a thing for Doris Day.

1543
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:04,747
She was a good woman.
You know the strega?

1544
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,500
It's hard to miss a lady with
four warts and only one eye.

1545
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:11,712
She needs the heads.

1546
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:18,719
Take this to the witch.

1547
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:22,014
Now, why does she need that?

1548
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:25,059
-She takes the eyes.
-Wonderful!

1549
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:28,771
Puts them in a bowl and mixes
them with water and oil.

1550
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:30,147
And then?

1551
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:36,528
People get headaches, they go to her.
She looks into their eyes...

1552
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:39,740
...and tells them who is
wishing the headaches.

1553
01:49:40,365 --> 01:49:43,911
She says a few words, and
the headaches go away.

1554
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:48,916
Once in a while, the person who
wished the headaches, goes away too.

1555
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:53,253
This guy, Addison, the one
who works for the Mayor...

1556
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,547
...he quits his job in 2 weeks.

1557
01:49:56,757 --> 01:50:00,260
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1558
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:03,639
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1559
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,725
-He knows this?
-He will.

1560
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,979
The boys he buys for
parties are expensive.

1561
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:14,483
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1562
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:16,985
How much does he owe?

1563
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:21,156
Eight grand with a heavy vig.
I paid that off.

1564
01:50:21,323 --> 01:50:25,619
-You paid?
-Addison's debts belong to me now.

1565
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:29,748
-You hate debts.
-I hate Addison!

1566
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:35,754
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1567
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,881
And I like to play alone.

1568
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:43,095
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1569
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,821
His mother named him Edward Goldenberg
Robinson, after her favorite actor.

1570
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,865
To continue the Hollywood connection...

1571
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:05,534
Eddie Robinson took the street name
"Little Caesar"...

1572
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:09,038
...as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.

1573
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:12,750
He had a 12-year-old son in a
private school in upstate New York.

1574
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:15,544
He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother...

1575
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:19,173
...who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

1576
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:23,093
-I want you to give me some money.
-All right.

1577
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:26,972
I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

1578
01:51:27,473 --> 01:51:30,809
I ain't paying it back.
Somebody else is.

1579
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:34,772
This somebody I know?

1580
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:38,442
-Your little brother knew him.
-Rizzo?

1581
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,446
How did he know Rizzo?

1582
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:47,493
Henry Addison was a guard
in an upstate reform school.

1583
01:51:47,785 --> 01:51:52,122
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1584
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,506
Count out $8,000.
Put it in an envelope.

1585
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:08,639
You...go back a long time, old man.

1586
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:11,517
Old men always do.

1587
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,770
Ran with the guineas, back
when the guineas were tough.

1588
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:16,146
I ran when I could.

1589
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:18,857
Looked good doing it, too.

1590
01:52:21,777 --> 01:52:25,781
Gave the business some style, some class.

1591
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:30,536
Made it a call for respect, the way
you wore it...the way you talked it.

1592
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:34,164
I always liked that about you.

1593
01:52:34,707 --> 01:52:38,043
I'm no help to you.
My tailor is dead.

1594
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:49,388
I'll look up our friend and
collect the money he owes me.

1595
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,682
He owes you something more than money.

1596
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,143
Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1597
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:57,396
-This is.
-What, old man?

1598
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:00,607
What's this guy owe that
means more than dollars?

1599
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:05,112
He owes you Rizzo. He's the man
that killed your brother.

1600
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:16,457
They said he died of pneumonia.

1601
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:18,083
They said.

1602
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:27,092
What is the relevance of this?

1603
01:53:27,593 --> 01:53:30,262
So, Ralph Ferguson is
a Sunday school teacher?

1604
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:33,265
I don't know, counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1605
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:38,312
I understand that, Your Honor. Again,
I need to put a face to the victim.

1606
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:42,316
Otherwise it's just another
name in the obituaries.

1607
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,110
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1608
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:48,572
I don't have a problem with that.

1609
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:53,202
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1610
01:54:19,812 --> 01:54:21,897
-Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
-Good morning.

1611
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:25,526
I'd like to thank you for coming, I
understand it's been a long trip for you.

1612
01:54:26,485 --> 01:54:28,445
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1613
01:54:29,905 --> 01:54:32,282
You and the victim, Sean Nokes,
were such good friends.

1614
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:35,119
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

1615
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:38,038
We were great friends. It would
be hard to find a better friend.

1616
01:54:38,831 --> 01:54:42,626
-Would you say you were his best friend?
-I was his closest, that's for sure.

1617
01:54:43,419 --> 01:54:47,381
-How long did you know each other?
-About 17, 18 years.

1618
01:54:48,173 --> 01:54:49,508
And did you see each other often?

1619
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:54,430
As often as we could...
weekends, holidays, vacations.

1620
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:59,935
-What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
-He was a good man.

1621
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,521
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1622
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:05,524
Objection, Your Honor, statement
is one of opinion not fact.

1623
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:06,942
He was asked his opinion.

1624
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:09,278
Overruled. Please proceed.

1625
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:15,325
Mr. Ferguson...were you aware of
any enemies he might have had?

1626
01:55:15,701 --> 01:55:17,453
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1627
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:21,540
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1628
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:27,796
Is that a prison?

1629
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,340
No, it's a juvenile
facility for young boys.

1630
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:33,427
Your function was what at this facility?

1631
01:55:33,552 --> 01:55:35,304
Standard stuff.

1632
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:39,558
Keep the boys in line, make sure
they got to classes on time....

1633
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:42,811
Keep an eye out for trouble,
put them down for the night.

1634
01:55:43,896 --> 01:55:47,649
As guards, were you and
Mr. Nokes allowed to use force to...

1635
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:49,818
...as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1636
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:52,404
What...what do you mean, force?

1637
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:53,447
Were you allowed to hit them?

1638
01:55:55,699 --> 01:55:56,575
Of course not.

1639
01:55:56,909 --> 01:56:00,704
Were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards any time at the Wilkinson home?

1640
01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:05,209
I'm sure something like that
may have happened. It was a...

1641
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:09,213
...big place, but it wasn't
the common practice.

1642
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:10,714
Let's narrow the place down.

1643
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:14,259
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit any
of the boys under your care...

1644
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:16,887
...at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1645
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:27,106
Would you like me to
repeat the question?

1646
01:56:27,314 --> 01:56:28,232
No.

1647
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,444
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

1648
01:56:33,487 --> 01:56:36,573
A few of the boys who we considered
to be discipline problems...

1649
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,742
...were hit on occasion.

1650
01:56:38,951 --> 01:56:40,452
And how were they hit?

1651
01:56:40,661 --> 01:56:42,496
-I don't know what you mean.
-A fist?

1652
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:46,834
Open hand? Kick? Baton, maybe?

1653
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:51,255
-Depends on what the situation called for.
-Who determined that situation?

1654
01:56:51,797 --> 01:56:52,673
The guard on the scene.

1655
01:56:53,424 --> 01:56:55,426
That's a lot of power to
have over a boy, isn't it?

1656
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:59,513
-It came with the job, sir.
-Did torture come with the job?

1657
01:57:08,814 --> 01:57:11,275
Boys were tortured, weren't they,
Mr. Ferguson?

1658
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:12,359
Define torture.

1659
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,113
Well, let's define torture.

1660
01:57:18,574 --> 01:57:19,616
Cigarette burning...

1661
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,119
...random beatings...

1662
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:27,207
...solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1663
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:32,379
-Say that took place?
-On occasion.

1664
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,549
-Who tortured them?
-Guards.

1665
01:57:35,758 --> 01:57:36,759
Which guards?

1666
01:57:38,594 --> 01:57:40,929
I can't remember all of them.

1667
01:57:42,765 --> 01:57:43,724
Remember one.

1668
01:57:53,192 --> 01:57:54,234
Remember one.

1669
01:58:01,408 --> 01:58:04,745
This line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case.

1670
01:58:05,287 --> 01:58:07,289
-It will, Your Honor.
-For your sake.

1671
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:12,795
Mr. Ferguson, was there ever any sexual
abuse at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1672
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:20,803
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1673
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:24,264
Yes, I heard that there was.

1674
01:58:24,431 --> 01:58:25,766
I'm not asking what you heard.

1675
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:29,853
I'm asking...what you...saw.

1676
01:58:31,355 --> 01:58:32,439
Please, Ferguson, don't do this.

1677
01:58:33,148 --> 01:58:34,441
I thought you boys liked it.

1678
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:37,111
Yes, I saw.

1679
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:42,658
Did you and Sean Nokes ever
force yourself on any of the boys?

1680
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:45,994
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape...

1681
01:58:46,495 --> 01:58:49,331
...any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

1682
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:59,383
Counselors...approach.

1683
01:59:11,395 --> 01:59:13,105
I just fucked your
little friend, Johnny.

1684
01:59:13,272 --> 01:59:15,232
Counselor, what the
hell is going on here?

1685
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,154
I guess I called the
wrong character witness.

1686
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:24,074
Counselor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness...

1687
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:25,409
...now, it's blown up in your face.

1688
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:27,619
Please Mr. Ferguson,
don't do this, please.

1689
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:35,210
Mr. Ferguson,
please answer the question.

1690
01:59:39,757 --> 01:59:42,593
-Mr. Ferguson, Sean Nokes...
-I like it nice and slow.

1691
01:59:43,135 --> 01:59:46,472
...visited your home on numerous
occasions, is that correct?

1692
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:50,267
Did you ever leave Sean Nokes
alone with your child?

1693
01:59:50,768 --> 01:59:51,560
A child?

1694
01:59:52,144 --> 01:59:55,481
Yes, in other words, would your
ex-wife ever leave Sean Nokes alone...

1695
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,441
...with your child?

1696
01:59:57,608 --> 01:59:58,942
There would be no reason for that.

1697
01:59:59,151 --> 02:00:02,654
There would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child. It wouldn't come up.

1698
02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:06,742
Never came up?
Did she ever voice any concern?

1699
02:00:06,909 --> 02:00:10,079
We have a statement explaining
why she would never allow...

1700
02:00:11,163 --> 02:00:14,833
...Sean Nokes to be in a
room alone with your son.

1701
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:16,585
-Objection!
-Sustained.

1702
02:00:26,011 --> 02:00:27,554
You ain't gonna touch me ever again!

1703
02:00:38,065 --> 02:00:38,816
Yes....

1704
02:00:50,077 --> 02:00:51,286
Yes?

1705
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,084
Yes, what?

1706
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:06,093
Yes, Sean Nokes had
experiences with some boys.

1707
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,975
-Were you there?
-Yes.

1708
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:17,980
-Did you observe these experiences?
-Yes.

1709
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:22,985
Did you do more than observe?

1710
02:01:23,277 --> 02:01:25,446
I was drinking then....

1711
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:31,785
Were there any other guards
around during these experiences?

1712
02:01:32,828 --> 02:01:33,704
Yes.

1713
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,250
-With you and Mr. Nokes?
-Yes.

1714
02:01:39,376 --> 02:01:42,629
-On more than one occasion?
-Yes.

1715
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:58,937
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think
that Sean Nokes was a good man?

1716
02:02:00,355 --> 02:02:01,482
He was my friend.

1717
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:07,529
A friend who raped and abused
boys he was paid to look after?

1718
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,752
I have no further questions.

1719
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:28,967
I want this to be over.

1720
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:32,930
I want this to be over.

1721
02:02:36,392 --> 02:02:37,810
Witness is excused.

1722
02:02:39,812 --> 02:02:40,604
Mr. Ferguson...

1723
02:02:42,606 --> 02:02:46,610
Mr. Ferguson, if I were you...

1724
02:02:46,777 --> 02:02:48,487
...l wouldn't stray too far from home.

1725
02:02:49,321 --> 02:02:51,573
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

1726
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:57,162
Michael continued to swim both ends
of the pool at the same time.

1727
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:01,709
Playing prosecution and defense attorney,
he exposed Ferguson for what he was...

1728
02:03:01,917 --> 02:03:04,128
...and still kept John and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes...

1729
02:03:04,211 --> 02:03:05,713
...hidden from the eyes of the court.

1730
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:11,051
Little Caesar, who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket...

1731
02:03:11,635 --> 02:03:13,262
...called in the Henry Addison loan.

1732
02:03:15,139 --> 02:03:17,141
It was a loan Addison couldn't
afford to pay back.

1733
02:03:17,891 --> 02:03:20,561
And it gave Little Caesar
the only reason he needed...

1734
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:22,354
...to even his score for Rizzo.

1735
02:03:53,218 --> 02:03:56,346
Davenport wasted little time on
following up on Adam Styler.

1736
02:03:57,181 --> 02:03:59,433
He was quickly arrested and charged
with the shooting death...

1737
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,603
...of the Queens drug dealer, and eight
counts of corruption and bribery.

1738
02:04:18,077 --> 02:04:19,411
That's six for me, two for you.

1739
02:04:23,916 --> 02:04:25,667
Most people play this game
in the summer.

1740
02:04:26,293 --> 02:04:28,462
It's easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

1741
02:04:29,129 --> 02:04:30,714
I give a fuck about most people!

1742
02:04:36,178 --> 02:04:39,348
You're gonna have a heart attack...
and I'm not breathing in your mouth.

1743
02:04:40,849 --> 02:04:42,309
Well, I'm not going to marry you either.

1744
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:49,149
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

1745
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:53,362
A spic be living in the White House by
the time it reaches their fucking brains!

1746
02:04:53,779 --> 02:04:56,698
Snyder came through big.
He's not half bad.

1747
02:04:57,157 --> 02:04:59,201
The way you told it, I thought
he could hardly stand up.

1748
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:02,037
He's a drunk, but he's not a fool.

1749
02:05:02,538 --> 02:05:04,456
We only win when John and Tommy walk.

1750
02:05:05,207 --> 02:05:07,710
Then you'll have to get them
out of the shooting hall.

1751
02:05:07,876 --> 02:05:11,380
You have to put them some place else.
And only a witness does that for you.

1752
02:05:11,672 --> 02:05:14,717
Now, he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker!

1753
02:05:15,134 --> 02:05:18,470
What if he doesn't show? What if
we have to go on the way we are?

1754
02:05:19,722 --> 02:05:21,557
The street is the only one that matters.

1755
02:05:22,182 --> 02:05:25,519
Court is for uptown people
with suits, money...

1756
02:05:25,686 --> 02:05:29,148
...lawyers with three names. If you
got cash, you can buy court justice.

1757
02:05:29,898 --> 02:05:32,568
But on the street, justice has no price.

1758
02:05:32,735 --> 02:05:36,196
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

1759
02:05:36,363 --> 02:05:40,868
-Out here, the bitch got eyes.
-We need both.

1760
02:05:42,745 --> 02:05:44,455
Then you need a witness.

1761
02:06:31,752 --> 02:06:35,089
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you are to disregard...

1762
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:36,590
...the testimony of Ralph Ferguson.

1763
02:06:37,174 --> 02:06:40,511
His entire testimony is
stricken from this record.

1764
02:06:40,803 --> 02:06:42,596
That concludes the people's case,
Your Honor.

1765
02:06:42,763 --> 02:06:44,473
-The people rest?
-The people rest.

1766
02:06:45,099 --> 02:06:46,475
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1767
02:06:51,146 --> 02:06:53,982
Your Honor, I don't...
I don't know.

1768
02:06:54,149 --> 02:06:54,942
You don't know?

1769
02:06:55,275 --> 02:06:57,444
Well, I'm not sure that...
we're waiting...

1770
02:06:58,612 --> 02:07:01,615
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Present
a witness or be prepared to sum up!

1771
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:25,681
Everything good?

1772
02:08:02,092 --> 02:08:04,762
I found it very interesting
attending morning Mass.

1773
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:10,934
Your Honor, the defense
calls Father Robert Carillo.

1774
02:08:19,985 --> 02:08:21,737
Father, do you know most of
the people in your parish?

1775
02:08:22,321 --> 02:08:23,405
I know all the people in my parish.

1776
02:08:23,572 --> 02:08:25,949
Do you know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?

1777
02:08:27,451 --> 02:08:30,454
-How long have you known them?
-Since they were boys.

1778
02:08:31,288 --> 02:08:32,623
They were both students of mine.

1779
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:33,457
Remain standing.

1780
02:08:34,666 --> 02:08:36,627
-How long have you been there?
-It'll be twenty years this spring.

1781
02:08:39,213 --> 02:08:40,130
I'm a priest.

1782
02:08:40,297 --> 02:08:41,799
In the case of the people
of the State of New York...

1783
02:08:41,882 --> 02:08:43,842
...against John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano...

1784
02:08:44,843 --> 02:08:47,179
...do you swear the evidence
you are about to give is the truth...

1785
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:49,932
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

1786
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:52,351
I do.

1787
02:08:52,851 --> 02:08:57,272
Acting pastor, serve Mass daily,
listen to confessions....

1788
02:08:59,525 --> 02:09:03,237
Do you recall where you were on the
night of November first this past year?

1789
02:09:03,695 --> 02:09:06,156
-Yes, I do.
-Where was that?

1790
02:09:06,407 --> 02:09:09,993
I was at the basketball game at
the Garden: the Knicks vs. the Celtics.

1791
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:13,664
And when did the Knicks game begin?

1792
02:09:16,041 --> 02:09:18,043
-About 7:30.
-What time did it end?

1793
02:09:18,877 --> 02:09:20,212
Between 9:30 and 10:00.

1794
02:09:21,338 --> 02:09:22,673
Do you remember who won that game?

1795
02:09:23,507 --> 02:09:25,050
Sad to say, it was the Celtics.

1796
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:28,554
Kevin McHale and Robert Parish were
a little too much for our boys that night.

1797
02:09:28,846 --> 02:09:30,180
Even if it was All Saints Day.

1798
02:09:31,432 --> 02:09:33,851
Next time, you give me a call,
I'll try my guy.

1799
02:09:33,934 --> 02:09:34,893
I'll try that.

1800
02:09:37,855 --> 02:09:39,565
Father Carillo,
were you at the game alone?

1801
02:09:41,442 --> 02:09:42,776
No, I went there with two friends.

1802
02:09:43,777 --> 02:09:45,112
And who were those two friends?

1803
02:09:47,114 --> 02:09:48,949
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

1804
02:09:50,909 --> 02:09:54,663
-The two defendants?
-Yes, the same two defendants.

1805
02:09:55,789 --> 02:09:59,668
Father Carillo, at 8:25 p.m.,
the time the police say...

1806
02:10:00,252 --> 02:10:02,254
...victim Sean Nokes was murdered...

1807
02:10:02,463 --> 02:10:06,091
...were you still with Mr. Reilly and
Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

1808
02:10:06,425 --> 02:10:07,760
Yes, I was.

1809
02:10:08,135 --> 02:10:11,764
And what time did you, Mr. Reilly,
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1810
02:10:13,432 --> 02:10:16,769
It was around 10:30...a little later.

1811
02:10:17,436 --> 02:10:20,439
They dropped me off in front of the
rectory, near where they'd picked me up.

1812
02:10:21,607 --> 02:10:23,025
Did the two defendants tell
you where they were going?

1813
02:10:23,984 --> 02:10:26,779
No, they didn't, but I imagine,
after a night spent with a priest...

1814
02:10:26,987 --> 02:10:28,947
...they went looking for the
first open bar they could find.

1815
02:10:30,532 --> 02:10:34,661
So then, Father, if the two defendants
were with you at 8:25...

1816
02:10:34,828 --> 02:10:37,956
...the night of the murder, they couldn't
have shot and killed Sean Nokes...

1817
02:10:38,123 --> 02:10:40,501
...as the prosecution contends.
Isn't that correct?

1818
02:10:42,044 --> 02:10:44,338
Not unless they shot him from
the blue seats at the Garden.

1819
02:10:47,383 --> 02:10:48,842
He was not shot from there.

1820
02:10:52,012 --> 02:10:53,722
And he was not shot by those boys.

1821
02:10:55,891 --> 02:10:57,976
No further questions, Your Honor.

1822
02:10:58,685 --> 02:11:00,104
Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.

1823
02:11:00,604 --> 02:11:01,563
Thank you, Your Honor.

1824
02:11:07,236 --> 02:11:09,238
Did you buy the tickets for the game
Father, or were they given to you?

1825
02:11:09,405 --> 02:11:11,073
-No, I bought them.
-On the day of the game?

1826
02:11:11,365 --> 02:11:13,575
I went to the box office
about a week before.

1827
02:11:14,368 --> 02:11:16,954
Did anyone know you were going to the
game, other than the two defendants?

1828
02:11:17,246 --> 02:11:18,163
I don't think so.

1829
02:11:18,872 --> 02:11:21,333
Was anyone with you when
you purchased the tickets?

1830
02:11:21,417 --> 02:11:22,209
No.

1831
02:11:22,543 --> 02:11:24,920
-No one saw you buy the tickets?
-That's right.

1832
02:11:25,254 --> 02:11:27,256
-Did you get a receipt?
-No, I didn't.

1833
02:11:27,548 --> 02:11:30,426
Paid by check?
Mastercard? Visa?

1834
02:11:30,759 --> 02:11:34,221
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1835
02:11:36,223 --> 02:11:38,851
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

1836
02:11:38,934 --> 02:11:39,768
Very much.

1837
02:11:41,311 --> 02:11:43,564
And there isn't anything you
wouldn't do for them, am I right?

1838
02:11:44,189 --> 02:11:46,734
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1839
02:11:47,776 --> 02:11:51,113
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1840
02:11:51,947 --> 02:11:53,615
Something along those lines, yes.

1841
02:11:54,116 --> 02:11:57,077
And is it true then, as a good father,
you would want to protect them...

1842
02:11:57,244 --> 02:11:58,579
...from something they
shouldn't have done.

1843
02:11:58,787 --> 02:12:02,791
As much as I would want to protect them
from what someone else said they did.

1844
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:06,670
-Like a murder?
-Yes, like a murder.

1845
02:12:07,963 --> 02:12:11,592
Let me get this straight then.
No one knew you were going to the game.

1846
02:12:11,759 --> 02:12:14,219
No one saw you at the game. No one
saw you buy tickets for the game.

1847
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:15,888
There's no record you even
bought tickets.

1848
02:12:15,971 --> 02:12:18,015
You have no receipt for the tickets.

1849
02:12:18,307 --> 02:12:22,019
-Am I correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

1850
02:12:22,644 --> 02:12:24,271
Then how do we really know, Father?

1851
02:12:24,688 --> 02:12:25,898
How do we know...

1852
02:12:26,231 --> 02:12:28,901
...you and the two defendants were
at the game on the night of the murder?

1853
02:12:30,277 --> 02:12:33,906
I'm telling you as a witness...
and as a priest. We were at the game.

1854
02:12:34,073 --> 02:12:37,868
Yes, as a priest, and a priest
wouldn't lie? Am I right?

1855
02:12:38,535 --> 02:12:41,038
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1856
02:12:43,916 --> 02:12:45,417
I always keep the stubs.

1857
02:12:50,381 --> 02:12:51,173
Do you want to see them?

1858
02:12:58,555 --> 02:13:00,808
Why is that, Father?
Why do you keep the stubs?

1859
02:13:01,558 --> 02:13:04,395
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1860
02:13:06,855 --> 02:13:08,774
Has anyone ever questioned
your word before today?

1861
02:13:09,024 --> 02:13:13,320
No. No one ever has. But there's
a first time for everything.

1862
02:13:23,497 --> 02:13:26,125
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1863
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,796
Thank you, Father.
You may step down.

1864
02:13:38,137 --> 02:13:41,724
I've never recovered from seeing Father
Bobby take the stand and lie for us...

1865
02:13:41,974 --> 02:13:43,809
...to even the score for John and Tommy.

1866
02:13:45,269 --> 02:13:48,313
He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson's...

1867
02:13:48,897 --> 02:13:50,983
...and the evil that had lived
there for too long.

1868
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:53,652
Still, I was sorry he had to do it.

1869
02:14:00,993 --> 02:14:03,787
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1870
02:14:03,996 --> 02:14:07,833
...do you find the defendant,
John Reilly, guilty or not guilty?

1871
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,001
Not guilty.

1872
02:14:09,168 --> 02:14:11,795
With respect to the charge of
murder in the second degree...

1873
02:14:11,962 --> 02:14:16,633
...do you find the defendant, Thomas
Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1874
02:14:16,925 --> 02:14:18,010
Not guilty.

1875
02:14:18,886 --> 02:14:22,014
Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.

1876
02:14:42,785 --> 02:14:45,079
Hi, how are you?
Could I get a hot dog?

1877
02:14:46,330 --> 02:14:50,334
Mustard and relish...a lot of relish.

1878
02:14:53,379 --> 02:14:54,838
Give him two napkins.

1879
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:02,054
You did good in there, counselor.

1880
02:15:04,598 --> 02:15:06,058
So, what happens to you now?

1881
02:15:06,392 --> 02:15:08,018
What happens?
I walk away.

1882
02:15:09,937 --> 02:15:11,939
Wait a few weeks,
I'll hand them my notice.

1883
02:15:13,107 --> 02:15:15,109
After the way I handled this case...

1884
02:15:15,984 --> 02:15:17,986
...they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1885
02:15:20,781 --> 02:15:24,576
So, you switch to the other side and work
as a defense lawyer. The money's better.

1886
02:15:25,911 --> 02:15:28,288
There's always gonna be more
bad guys than good, Mikey.

1887
02:15:30,249 --> 02:15:32,918
And can you imagine the work you'd
get from John and Tommy's crew?

1888
02:15:34,002 --> 02:15:35,295
That's a house and a pool.

1889
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:42,010
Not for me. I've seen
all the law I want to see.

1890
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:46,140
-It's time for something else.
-Like what?

1891
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:47,975
I'll let you know when I know.

1892
02:15:49,184 --> 02:15:51,729
You know, you're too old to
play for the Yankees...

1893
02:15:51,812 --> 02:15:53,188
...and you're too young to take up golf.

1894
02:15:53,647 --> 02:15:55,482
Why are you shooting holes
through all of my plans?

1895
02:15:55,649 --> 02:15:56,692
You gonna make me panic.

1896
02:15:58,444 --> 02:15:59,778
You'll work it out.
You always have.

1897
02:16:05,993 --> 02:16:07,578
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1898
02:16:09,705 --> 02:16:12,916
I just want to shut my eyes and not
have to see the places I've been.

1899
02:16:15,836 --> 02:16:16,879
I'm weary...

1900
02:16:21,425 --> 02:16:22,468
I don't know.

1901
02:16:25,554 --> 02:16:27,765
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

1902
02:16:29,391 --> 02:16:31,351
Well, don't disappear on me,
counselor.

1903
02:16:32,936 --> 02:16:34,730
I may need a good lawyer one day.

1904
02:16:34,938 --> 02:16:36,065
You can't afford a good lawyer.

1905
02:16:39,068 --> 02:16:40,569
I may need a good friend, though.

1906
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:46,283
I'll find you when you do.
Count on it.

1907
02:16:48,452 --> 02:16:49,578
Always have.

1908
02:16:56,251 --> 02:16:59,797
A full month had passed since the
acquittal, and no one had made contact.

1909
02:17:00,381 --> 02:17:03,050
In those few weeks, our lives had
reverted back to what they'd been...

1910
02:17:03,217 --> 02:17:05,052
...prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.

1911
02:17:05,677 --> 02:17:09,014
Carol had returned to her
stack of social service files...

1912
02:17:09,223 --> 02:17:10,641
...helping troubled teens
and single mothers.

1913
02:17:11,475 --> 02:17:15,145
John and Tommy went back to the
streets, running the West Side Boys.

1914
02:17:15,938 --> 02:17:20,067
I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.

1915
02:17:20,818 --> 02:17:23,070
Michael, as he'd promised,
resigned from his job...

1916
02:17:23,278 --> 02:17:25,489
...after working the losing
end of a "can't miss case".

1917
02:17:30,744 --> 02:17:32,496
I don't know how to fucking thank you!

1918
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:39,628
I can't believe what you did.
I can't believe we got away with it!

1919
02:17:39,795 --> 02:17:42,673
It wasn't me. That was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1920
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:45,467
When I first heard he was taking the
case, I was gonna have him burned.

1921
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:49,179
I figured, he's a friend, and if you've
gotta be sent away on a murder rap...

1922
02:17:49,346 --> 02:17:50,013
...who better to do it?

1923
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:52,850
Well, the way he was handling the case,
I thought he sucked as a lawyer.

1924
02:17:53,058 --> 02:17:54,476
I started feeling sorry for the bastard.

1925
02:17:55,477 --> 02:17:56,937
Never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1926
02:17:58,021 --> 02:17:59,481
Get over here, counselor!

1927
02:18:00,441 --> 02:18:02,693
You are the real Count!

1928
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:05,154
Alive and well and
living in New York City!

1929
02:18:07,322 --> 02:18:09,658
You fucking maniac! All right!

1930
02:18:11,869 --> 02:18:13,370
What is this, a gay bar?

1931
02:18:15,039 --> 02:18:16,373
It was until you came in!

1932
02:18:16,665 --> 02:18:18,208
Why don't you give me a
kiss to go with that hello?

1933
02:18:24,882 --> 02:18:26,717
Get out of the way.

1934
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:33,307
Let's have a drink.

1935
02:18:39,188 --> 02:18:40,522
The Four Gladiators!

1936
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:45,694
The "Four Gladiators", worst quartet
to ever hold a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1937
02:18:46,695 --> 02:18:48,697
But what was that name that
Shakes wanted to call it?

1938
02:18:48,947 --> 02:18:52,159
Genius wanted to call it,
"The Count and His Cristos."

1939
02:18:52,409 --> 02:18:54,661
-Nice!
-Well, you know, it's so sweet, isn't it?

1940
02:18:56,288 --> 02:18:58,290
Hey, that would've sent albums
flying out of the store.

1941
02:18:58,457 --> 02:19:00,876
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

1942
02:19:01,043 --> 02:19:02,753
That kid at the deaf school don't count!

1943
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:08,926
One song for Carol.

1944
02:19:09,635 --> 02:19:11,887
-I retired a long time ago.
-Come on, you mutts!

1945
02:19:12,262 --> 02:19:14,264
Don't you guys have to go out
and shoot somebody?

1946
02:19:19,937 --> 02:19:22,064
We always got time for a song!

1947
02:19:23,524 --> 02:19:25,275
Just kidding, you know what I'm saying?

1948
02:19:26,902 --> 02:19:28,487
You pick it, Mikey.
Nothing too slow.

1949
02:19:28,862 --> 02:19:29,696
Start us up.

1950
02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:35,786
-How many songs do you know?
-One.

1951
02:19:41,625 --> 02:19:46,296
"Walk...like...a...man!"

1952
02:19:49,299 --> 02:19:51,301
"Walk like a man..."

1953
02:19:51,468 --> 02:19:52,678
"...fast as you can..."

1954
02:19:53,178 --> 02:19:56,515
"Walk...like a man, my son..."

1955
02:19:57,641 --> 02:20:00,894
"Go tell the world...
forget about the girl!"

1956
02:20:01,186 --> 02:20:02,896
Don't forget about the girl!

1957
02:20:17,161 --> 02:20:19,496
On March 16, 1984...

1958
02:20:19,663 --> 02:20:22,791
John Reilly's bloated body was found
face up in a tenement building...

1959
02:20:23,292 --> 02:20:25,586
...right next to the bottle of
boiler gin that killed him.

1960
02:20:26,170 --> 02:20:29,882
At the time of his death, he was a
suspect in five unsolved homicides.

1961
02:20:30,257 --> 02:20:32,676
He was two weeks past
his 29th birthday.

1962
02:20:37,723 --> 02:20:41,185
Thomas Marcano died on July 26, 1985.

1963
02:20:41,351 --> 02:20:43,812
He was shot at close range 5 times.

1964
02:20:44,188 --> 02:20:46,607
The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.

1965
02:20:47,066 --> 02:20:50,235
There was a crucifix and a picture
of Saint Jude in his pocket.

1966
02:20:50,611 --> 02:20:52,071
He was 29 years old.

1967
02:20:54,448 --> 02:20:57,534
Michael Sullivan lives in a small
town in the English countryside...

1968
02:20:57,701 --> 02:20:59,370
...where he works part-time
as a carpenter.

1969
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:02,915
He no longer practices law,
and he has never married.

1970
02:21:03,582 --> 02:21:05,292
He lives quietly and alone.

1971
02:21:08,087 --> 02:21:12,257
Carol still works for a Social Service
agency and lives in Hell's Kitchen.

1972
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:13,926
She has never married...

1973
02:21:14,301 --> 02:21:16,929
...but is a single mother supporting
a growing 12-year-old son.

1974
02:21:18,138 --> 02:21:22,476
The boy, John Thomas Michael
Martinez, loves to read...

1975
02:21:22,935 --> 02:21:24,520
...and is called Shakes by his mother.

1976
02:21:27,481 --> 02:21:30,984
It was our special night, and we
held it for as long as we could.

1977
02:21:31,527 --> 02:21:32,903
It was our happy ending.

1978
02:21:33,904 --> 02:21:36,323
And the last time we would
ever be together again.

1979
02:22:25,914 --> 02:22:28,042
The future lay sparkling ahead...

1980
02:22:28,417 --> 02:22:30,586
...and we thought we would
know each other forever.
