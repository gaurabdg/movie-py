The Pianist

2
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,010
- Mr. Szpilman?\N- Hello.

3
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,720
I came specially to meet you.\NI love your playing.

4
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,810
- Who are you?\N- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

5
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,520
- You're bleeding!\N- It's nothing.

6
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,690
You can write him a fan letter later.\NThis isn't the best time. Come on.

7
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,450
Jurek, where have you been\Nhiding her?

8
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,410
- I don't know what to take.\N- You always take too much.

9
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,710
How many suitcases are you taking?

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
What do you think, should I take\Nuncle Szymon's portrait?

11
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,260
Take it, don't take it,\Ntake what you like.

12
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,880
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

13
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,840
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

14
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,020
- I should have another case.\N- Mama, Wladek is home!

15
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank God.\NWladek! You're wounded?

16
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,860
- No, it was nothing.\N- I've been worried sick.

17
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,610
I told her not to worry.\NYou had your papers on you.

18
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,690
If you'd been hit by a bomb,\Nthey'd know where to take you.

19
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,950
Henryk, don't say things like that.\NGod forbid. God forbid.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,200
- Papa, Wladek is home.\N- What did I tell you?

21
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,830
- What are you doing?\N- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

22
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,750
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.\N- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Pack, darling.\NGet your things packed.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,050
- Where are we going?\N- Out of Warsaw.

25
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,880
- Out of Warsaw where?\N- You haven't heard?

26
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,720
- Heard what?\N- Haven't you seen the paper?

27
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,430
- Where's the paper?\N- I used it for packing.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,140
- She used it for packing.\N- The government has moved to Lublin.

29
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,770
All men must leave the city, go across\Nthe river, set up a new line of defense.

30
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,900
There isn't anybody left here, only\Nthe women. The men are all gone.

31
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,740
What do you think you'll do while\Nthey set up a new line of defense?

32
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,240
- Wonder around with your suitcases?\N- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

33
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,240
- I'm not going anywhere.\N- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

34
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,080
Don't be ridiculous,\Nwe've got to keep together.

35
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,630
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to\Ndie in my own home, staying put.

36
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,710
- God forbid.\N- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,090
...from the BBC in London.\NThe British government...

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
having received no reply\Nto the observations presented...

39
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,100
to the German government...

40
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,270
has declared war on nazi Germany.

41
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,230
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!\N- It is expected that...

42
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,330
...within the next few hours, France\Nwill make a similar declaration.

43
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,910
Poland is no longer alone.

44
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,340
Wonderful, wonderful!

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,970
- Mama, that was a great dinner.\N- It certainly was.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,680
When there's something to celebrate,\Nyou've got to make an effort.

47
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,850
Here's to Great Britain and France!

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,850
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?\NAll will be well.

49
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,310
Five thousand and three.

50
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,640
- Is that all?\N- Yes. It's all we've got left.

51
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,020
- It's 3,003 too much.\N- Look.

52
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,610
"Further restrictions\Nregarding liquid assets.

53
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,030
Jews will be allowed to keep a\Nmaximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

54
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,740
- What do we do with the rest?\N- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

55
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,700
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough\Nto deposit money in a German bank?

56
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,540
We could hide the money. Look here.\NWe can hide it under the flowerpots.

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll tell you what we'll do.\NWe'll use try and tested methods.

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,420
You know what we did\Nin the last war?

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,510
We made a hole in the table leg,\Nand hid the money in there.

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,180
- Suppose they take the table away?\N- What do you mean?

61
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,980
Germans go into Jewish homes and\Ntake furniture, valuables, anything.

62
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,980
- Do they?\N- Why'd they want a table like this?

63
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,230
- What on earth are you doing?\N- Listen. Look.

64
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,530
This is the best place. No-one would\Nthink of looking under the flowerpot.

65
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,870
- No, listen. I've been thinking...\N- Really? That's a change.

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,370
- You know what? We use psychology.\N- We use what?

67
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,500
We leave the money and the watch\Non the table, covered. In full view.

68
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,260
- Are you stupid?\N- The Germans will never notice it.

69
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,390
That's the stupidest thing I've ever\Nseen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

70
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,970
Look here.

71
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,060
Idiot.

72
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,100
- And you call me stupid.\N- Very good. That's the last place...

73
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,400
- This would take hours.\N- We're not in a hurry.

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,820
- It won't take hours.\N- How will you get them out? Tell me.

75
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,070
- How will you get them out?\N- Quiet! Order, please!

76
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,990
- You reach them out individually.\N- No-one listens to me!

77
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,030
Quiet, please, quiet.\NOrder, order, please.

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,500
- The lawyer, she likes order.\N- Listen, just listen. Look.

79
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,290
The watch we put under the flowerpot\Nand the money we stuff in the violin.

80
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,960
- But I'll still be able to play?\N- You'll find out.

81
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,930
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.\N- Wladek, how are you?

82
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,180
We're fine, thank you.\NAnd you?

83
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,640
Fine, under the circumstances.\NI guess I know why you're calling.

84
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,020
There's nothing we can do.\NThey won't reopen the station.

85
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,990
- Yes, I know, but I...\N- No music, no radio for the Polish.

86
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,490
But sure you'll find work.\NA pianist like you.

87
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,120
Maybe, maybe not, but...

88
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,460
don't be offended, but I didn't call\Nto discuss my future carrier.

89
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,880
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,\Nand at last he gave in and said...

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,250
"All right, come with me tomorrow",\Nso I came and...

91
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,840
they bombed the station.

92
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,550
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.\N- Really?

93
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,220
Yes, it was unforgettable.

94
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,020
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.\N- Call me Wladek, please.

95
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,480
- No-one plays Chopin like you.\N- I hope it's a compliment.

96
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,360
- Of course, I mean it.\N- I was... trying to be funny.

97
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,860
- Should we go and have a coffee?\N- I'd like that.

98
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,160
- And you, what do you do?\N- I finished with the conservatoire.

99
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,330
- You're a musician?\N- Yes. But only just.

100
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,120
- What instrument?\N- The cello.

101
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,920
I love to see women\Nplaying the cello.

102
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,340
JEWS FORBIDDEN

103
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,800
This is disgraceful.\NHow dare they?

104
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,850
You know what people are like, they\Nwant to be better nazis than Hitler.

105
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,930
- I'm going in there to complain.\N- It's better not, believe me.

106
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,440
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!\N- Good-bye.

107
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,240
We'll find somewhere else.

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,740
- We can walk in the park.\N- No, we can't.

109
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,280
Official decree.\NNo Jews allowed in the park.

110
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,620
- My God. Are you joking?\N- I'm not joking, it's true.

111
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,710
We could sit in a bench, but\N"no Jews allowed on public benches".

112
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,750
This is absurd.

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,880
We can just stand here and talk.\NI think we're allowed to do that.

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,430
So, you play the cello. That's nice.\NAnd who's your favorite composer?

115
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
Chopin? Really? Well...

116
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,100
you'll have to learn to play\Nhis cello sonata, won't you?

117
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,440
What about you, Wladek?

118
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,610
Perhaps I could accompany.\NMe on the piano, you on the cello.

119
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,160
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,\Nquite wonderful.

120
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,450
Call me Wladek, please.

will have to move to the Jewish\Ndistrict by 31 of October, 1940."

151
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,920
They won't get all of us.\NIt's too small.

152
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,130
There's 400 thousand of us\Nin Warsaw.

153
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,880
No, 360 thousand.\NSo it will be easy.

154
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,970
What am I supposed to do?\NYou tell me.

155
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Mama?

156
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,810
Mama, what is it?

157
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,400
20 zlotys!

158
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,860
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

159
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,620
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

160
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,290
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,\Npotatoes, potatoes.

161
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,970
That's the price.\NThat's what I'm offering.

162
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,890
My advice is to accept.\NYou won't get more from anyone else.

163
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,020
- But it's a Bechstein!\N- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

164
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,230
What are you going to do when\Nyou're hungry? Eat the piano?

165
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,230
- Get out!\N- What's the matter with you?

166
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
- Stop it!\N- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

167
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,740
Haven't you eaten today?\NWhat are you suffering from?

168
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,610
You people are crazy.

169
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,830
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand\Nand I'm paying for the removal.

170
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,620
I'm not even charging\Nfor the removal!

171
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,080
You haven't eaten today.\NYou're crazy.

172
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,130
Take it.

173
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,370
Hello.

174
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,830
Hello. Hi.

175
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,250
I didn't want to come.

176
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,050
I didn't want to see all this, but...\NI couldn't stop myself.

177
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,180
- How are you doing?\N- Fine.

178
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
Good.

179
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,270
No, not really.\NThey arrested my cousin.

180
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,850
Jurek says they'll let him out.

181
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,690
- This is disgraceful.\N- It won't last long. Don't worry.

182
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,860
That's what I said myself.

183
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,740
It's too absurd.

184
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,910
I... I should go.

185
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,710
Well, I'll see you...

186
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,670
soon.

187
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,470
Good-bye.

188
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,780
Well...

189
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,070
to tell you the truth,\NI thought it would be worse.

190
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,710
- Where will we sleep?\N- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

191
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

192
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,470
Look.

193
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,010
Come and look.

194
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,250
Go away.

195
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,710
Go away! Go away!

196
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,970
Papa! Papa!

197
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,280
- Sell anything?\N- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

198
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,120
- 3 zlotys.\N- It's better than yesterday.

199
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,580
Three lousy zlotys. And there are\Npeople there making millions.

200
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,460
- I know.\N- You don't know, believe me.

201
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,080
They bribe the guards,\Nthe guards turn a blind eye.

202
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:48,090
They bring cartloads of food,\Ntobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

203
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,090
And the poor are dying all around\Nand they don't give a damn.

204
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,100
Excuse me, have you seen\Nmy husband, Izaak Szerman?

205
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,520
A tall handsome man,\Nwith a little gray beard.

206
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,270
- I'm afraid not.\N- Excuse me. Good-bye.

207
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,150
Sleep well. But if you see him,\Nwrite to me, yes?

208
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,400
Izaak Szerman.

209
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,630
Why do we have to have a gentile\Nstreet running through our area?

210
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,010
Why can't they go around?

211
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,930
Don't worry. They're about to build\Na bridge. Haven't you heard?

212
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,850
A bridge! Those idiots.

213
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,640
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

214
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,350
But do you know what I think?\NI think they're totally stupid.

215
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,570
I have a family to feed.\NI spend half of my time here...

216
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,030
waiting for them to let us through.

217
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,490
Maybe they think I come here\Nto listen to the music?

218
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,870
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?\N- What's wrong with you?

219
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,370
- Come on, do something.\N- Right. Dance!

220
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,330
- Dance!\N- Dance!

221
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,460
Come on, come on! Dance!

222
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,510
Very well.

223
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
What about you?\NDance with him.

224
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,430
Let's clear the street,\Nso the Jews can dance.

225
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,020
Come on. And you.

226
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,820
Go on.

227
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,330
Faster!

228
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,200
Come on!

229
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,910
Faster!

230
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,500
Come on!

231
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,010
Faster!

232
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,930
Come on, move! I said faster!\NCome on, Jews!

233
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,140
- Keep dancing.\N- Dance.

234
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,660
Good, they're here.

235
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,330
Itzak Heller has been\Nwaiting for you.

236
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,090
- What's this about?\N- Sit down, have tea.

237
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,760
I'll start lunch\Nwhen the girls get here.

238
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,980
- So, what are you doing here?\N- He brought cakes.

239
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,820
His father is back in the jewellery\Nbusiness. He's doing well.

240
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,780
Amazing, jewellery.

241
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,370
- We're recruiting.\N- Who is recruiting?

242
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,040
Don't be clever with me.\NI'm coming as a friend.

243
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,460
They're bringing Jews in\Nfrom all over the country.

244
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,710
Soon there will be half million people\Nin the ghetto.

245
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,880
- We need more Jewish police.\N- More Jewish police!

246
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,590
You want me to beat up Jews\Nand catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

247
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,340
- Someone has got to do it.\N- But why me?

248
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,930
I thought you only recruited boys\Nwith rich fathers.

249
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Look at my father, look at us...

250
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm\Nhere. You can have a better life.

251
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,110
- You want to survive selling books?\N- Yes, please.

252
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,690
I'm doing you people a favor.

253
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,650
What about you?\NYou're a great pianist.

254
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,320
We've got a police jazz band.\NThey'd welcome you with open arms.

255
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,700
- Join us. You've got no work.\N- Thank you, I've got work.

256
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

257
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,880
Who wants me to stop?

258
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,980
I always say,\Nlook on the bright side.

259
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,610
You're in a small ghetto with\Nintellectuals, professional people.

260
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,360
You're better off than us. Here in\Nthe large ghetto it's a cesspool.

261
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,700
- You have to give me something.\N- You're an artist...

262
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,950
you keep peoples' spirits up.\NYou do enough.

263
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,700
- I want to help, do something.\N- You're too well known.

264
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,830
And you know what? You musicians\Ndon't make good conspirators.

265
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,170
You're too... too musical.

266
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,140
- Who is that?\N- Symche.

267
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,510
Majorek.

268
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,730
There are notices going up. City is\Nto be cleansed of the undesirables.

269
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,940
- There's always notices going up.\N- Hello, Symche.

270
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,320
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

271
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,150
Jehuda, working hard?

272
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,320
This is the greatest pianist in\NPoland. Maybe the whole world.

273
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,450
Wladyslaw Szpilman,\Nmeet Majorek.

274
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,500
- How do you do?\N- I know your name.

275
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,210
- I've never heard you play.\N- Majorek used to be in the Army.

276
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,420
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got\Nagainst him is he's not a socialist.

277
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,180
You better go now, Wladek.\NIt's nearly curfew.

278
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,140
You know how many copies\Nwe print of our newspaper?

279
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,350
Five hundred.

280
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,850
You know how many people on\Naverage read one copy? Twenty.

281
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,690
That makes 10 thousand readers.\NThis will start the uprising.

282
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,150
Majorek hides them in his underpants\Nand leaves them in toilets.

283
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,200
- Toilets?\N- As many toilets as I can find.

284
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,950
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

285
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
They're too clean for them.

286
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,920
Please, mister, please.

287
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,490
Hold it!\NYou little bastard!

288
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,460
Take this!

289
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,670
Stop it! Stop it!

290
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,670
Stop it!

291
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,630
Come on, come on.\NCome on, boy.

292
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,640
Stand up! Stand up.

293
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,260
Please, tonight for once, I don't\Nwant anything bad talked about.

294
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,010
- Enjoy your meal.\N- Then I'll tell you something funny.

295
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,230
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?\N- The surgeon.

296
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,270
The Germans allowed him into\Nthe ghetto to perform an operation.

297
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,650
On a Jew? They let a Pole\Nto come in to operate on a Jew?

298
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,280
He got a pass, that's all I know.\NAnyway, so...

299
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,870
he puts the patient to sleep\Nand starts the operation.

300
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,370
He'd just made the first incision\Nwhen the SS burst in...

301
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,160
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja\Nand everybody else who was there.

302
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
Isn't that a laugh?

303
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,090
The patient didn't feel a thing,\Nhe was anesthetized.

304
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,090
I said nothing bad.

305
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,510
What's the matter with you all?\NYou lost your sense of humor?

306
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,390
It's not funny.

307
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,020
You know what's funny? You're\Nfunny, with that ridiculous tie.

308
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
What are you talking about? What's\Nmy tie have to do with anything?

309
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,860
- I need this tie for my work.\N- Your work?

310
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,360
- That's right, I work.\N- Playing the piano for the parasites.

311
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,740
- Parasites...\N- Boys. Boys!

312
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,500
- They don't give a damn.\N- And you blame me for their apathy?

313
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,210
I see it everyday. They don't even\Nnotice what's going around them.

314
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,380
- I blame the Americans.\N- For what? For my tie?

315
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
The American Jews,\Nand there are lots of them.

316
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,050
What do they think they're doing?\NPeople here are dying.

317
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,550
Haven't got a bite to eat.

318
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,060
The Jewish bankers should persuade\NAmerica to declare war on Germany.

319
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,160
The lights! The lights!

320
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,310
Turn on the lights.

321
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,690
Come on!

322
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,950
Open the door!\NWe want to go in!

323
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,780
Open the door!

324
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,670
Stand up!

325
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,430
You, stand up! Come on!

326
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,640
Throw him out!

327
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,990
Mama...

328
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,800
Come on, run!

329
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,040
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.\N- Go in. Not you.

330
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,970
- What?\N- Come. It's terrible.

331
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,310
- What?\N- They're hunting people in the streets.

332
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,770
They've taken Henryk.

333
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,400
Go home, alright? Go home,\NI'll take care of it.

334
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,750
Excuse me. Have you seen\Nmy husband? Izaak Szerman?

335
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,840
- I'm afraid not.\N- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

336
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,760
If you see him, write to me.\NDon't forget. Izaak Szerman.

337
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,520
What happened here?

338
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,480
They've got my grandson. They\Npick them up and take them away.

339
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,400
What they do to them,\NI've stopped believing in God.

340
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,110
Excuse me. Excuse me.

341
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,030
Itzak?

342
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,160
Itzak?

343
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,870
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

344
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,670
- Henryk is in there.\N- I haven't seen him.

345
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,050
Believe me.\NThey picked him up.

346
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,390
- Can you help?\N- Now you need me. Now you need me!

347
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,810
Can you help us?

348
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,190
- It costs.\N- I have no money.

349
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,990
Then there's nothing I can do.\NYou should have joined us.

350
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,610
- They told me you had influence.\N- Who told you?

351
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,370
People I know. They said\Nyou're an important man.

352
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,500
Itzak...

353
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,350
- Hands up.\N- How are you?

354
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,270
- How are you?\N- You, bandit.

355
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,650
Dead! Dead!

356
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,070
- He's crazy.\N- Hands up.

357
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,410
- Want a cigarette?\N- Cigarette?

358
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,910
Thank you.

359
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,580
Everything is alright!

360
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,920
He looks very happy.

361
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,000
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,630
Everything is alright.

363
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,760
Hands up! Hands up!

364
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,640
It's alright.

365
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,640
Help! Help!

366
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,480
Let go! Help!

367
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,240
- Why did they pick you up?\N- So you go to Itzak Heller?

368
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,000
- Did I ask you to talk to him?\N- You're out, aren't you?

369
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,130
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?\N- I asked him to help you.

370
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,010
What did you pay him?

371
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,470
With what could I pay him? Every\Nzloty I earn we spend on food.

372
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,720
- I can look after myself.\N- They were taking you away.

373
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,850
It's got nothing to do with you.\NIt's me they wanted, not you.

374
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,400
Why do you have to interfere\Nwith other people's business?

375
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,730
- You're mad. That's your trouble.\N- That's also my business.

376
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,290
What's the matter?\NAre you sick?

377
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,750
Hungry.

378
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,300
Employment certificate. What's that\Nmean, no employment certificate?

379
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,350
You have to have an\Nemployment certificate...

380
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,140
to work for the Germans\Nin the ghetto, otherwise...

381
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,190
- Otherwise what?\N- You'll be deported.

382
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,730
- So the rumors were true.\N- They're going to resettle us...

383
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,780
and send us to labor camps,\Nin the East.

384
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
- They're closing the small ghetto.\N- Oh, God!

385
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,930
Wladek? Wladek?

386
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,890
I thought you were on tour playing\Nin London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

387
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,890
- Not this week.\N- You look terrible.

388
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,060
Have you heard the rumors? They're\Ngoing to resettle us in the East.

389
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,400
Rumors! You take it all too much\Nto heart. What's the trouble?

390
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,030
I've been trying to get the certificate\Nof employment for my father.

391
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,620
I managed to get one for me and my\Nfamily, but I need one for my father.

392
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,040
- I've been to all the firms and shops...\N- Why didn't you come to me?

393
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,410
I didn't know you were\Nin the certificate business.

394
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm not, but Majorek is.

395
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,380
Can you help?\NI have no money.

396
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,970
Please, don't insult us.\NCan you do something for him?

397
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,590
Be at the Schultz workshop\Ntomorrow, four o'clock.

398
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,550
See what a wonderful piece\Nof luck you've had today?

399
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,640
That's the historical imperative in\Naction! That's why I always say:

400
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,230
- "Look on the bright side!"\N- Yes, I know.

401
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,950
- How's your back?\N- Better.

402
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Better?

403
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,330
Better not ask.

404
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,520
- Thank you.\N- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

405
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,310
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

406
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,340
At least we got work\Nin the ghetto.

407
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,720
At least we are still together.

408
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,410
Everybody out!\NTo the courtyard!

409
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,990
Move, move!

410
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,960
We are workers. We have\Nemployment certification.

411
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,880
Wait.

412
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,630
Here.

413
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,050
Go over there. Hurry.

414
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
You.

415
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,350
You. You.

416
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,930
You.

417
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,560
You.

418
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,150
You.

419
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,410
The others, put your clothes on\Nand come back here.

420
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,830
Bring your things with you.\N15 kilos only.

421
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,960
Where are you taking us?

422
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm sorry, I did my best.

423
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,620
- I thought the certificates'd save us.\N- Stop it, Wladek.

424
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,410
Let's just hope that Henryk\Nand Halina will be better off.

425
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,280
- Where will we be going?\N- You're going to work.

426
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,860
You'll be much better off than\Nin the stinking ghetto. Move.

427
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,450
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

428
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,540
Why did I do it?\NWhy did I do it?

429
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,380
Why did I do it?

430
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,300
Don't you have a bottle of water?\NHe's dying.

431
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,430
My child is dying of thirst.

432
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,520
- I beg you.\N- I'm sorry.

433
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,600
- Don't you have water? I beg you.\N- Can you hear what I'm saying?

434
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,110
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\N- I can hear you.

435
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,650
Letting them take us to our death\Nlike sheep to the slaughter.

436
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,990
- Not so loud.\N- Why don't we attack them?

437
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,360
There's half a million of us here.\NWe can break out of the ghetto.

438
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,280
At least we can die honorably, not\Nas a stain on the face of History.

439
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,200
Why are you so sure they're\Nsending us to our death?

440
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,000
You know why I'm not sure?\NBecause they didn't tell me.

441
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,250
- They're going to wipe us all out.\N- What do you want me to do? Fight?

442
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,090
To fight, we need organization,\Nplans, guns.

443
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,920
He's right. Do you think I'm going\Nto fight with my violin bowl?

444
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,970
The Germans would never squander\Na huge labor force like this.

445
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,600
They're sending us to a labor camp,\Nit's obvious.

446
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,180
Sure.

447
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,770
Look at that cripple, the old people,\Nthe children. They're going to work?

448
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,770
Look at you. You're going to carry\Nlogs on your back?

449
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,070
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

450
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,420
I missed you.\NI wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,760
I wanted to be with you!

452
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,050
Stupid. Stupid.

453
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,680
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

454
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,150
She's getting on my nerves.

455
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,110
- What did she do, for God's sake?\N- She smothered her baby.

456
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,660
They prepared a hiding place\Nand of course they went there.

457
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,750
The baby cried\Njust as the police came.

458
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,130
She smothered the cries with\Nher hands, the baby died.

459
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,170
A policeman heard the death rattle\Nand found where they were hiding.

460
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,620
What are you reading?

461
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,920
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?\NIf you tickle us, do we not laugh?

462
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,340
If you poison us, do we not die?

463
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,670
And, if you wrong us,\Nshall we not revenge?"

464
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,810
- Very appropriate.\N- Yes. That's why I brought it.

465
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,290
Idiot. What does he think\Nhe's gonna do with the money?

466
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,120
Boy, come here.

467
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,670
Come here.

468
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,010
- How much for a caramel?\N- 20 zlotys.

469
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,680
For one caramel? What do you think\Nyou're gonna do with the money?

470
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,180
20 zlotys.

471
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,930
We've got 20 between us.

472
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,690
I've got 10, I think.

473
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,230
5, 10, 20.

474
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,780
- Halina?\N- What?

475
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:28,110
- It's a funny time to say this, but...\N- What?

476
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,660
I wish I knew you better.

477
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,420
Thank you.

478
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,520
Szpilman?

479
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,650
Papa? Papa?

480
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,450
Mama? Halina?

481
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,620
Halina? Mama?

482
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:21,250
What do you think you're doing?\NI've saved your life. Just go! Go!

483
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,170
Don't run!

484
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,840
Anna!

485
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,390
Anna!

486
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,240
Off they go to the melting pot.

487
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:04,040
- This stays.\N- Give it to me!

488
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,890
What are you doing?\NShe's pregnant.

489
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,870
Wladek?

490
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,140
Why are you here, Wladek?

491
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,060
It's like this, I...

492
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,650
We...

493
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,860
All of them, all of them.

494
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,280
All of them.

495
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,370
Perhaps they're lucky.\NThe quicker, the better.

496
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,740
It's not finished yet. We'll stay\Nhere for a couple of days...

497
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,960
until things die down.

498
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,670
I've bribed the policeman,\Nhe'll come when it's over.

499
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,630
Attention!\NOn the march!

500
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,600
Onward!

501
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,110
My God, I haven't been outside in,\Nit must be two years.

502
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Don't get overexcited.

503
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,500
It's gold.\NVery good price.

504
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,530
Someone you know?

505
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,700
A beauty.\NWho is she?

506
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,990
She's a singer. I knew her well.\NHer husband is an actor.

507
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,660
They're good people.\NI'd like to talk to her.

508
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,710
Don't forget, Wladek.\NThey hang them for helping Jews.

509
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,950
Turn left!

510
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,610
On the march!

511
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,580
Stop! Halt!\NAttention!

512
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,840
At ease.

513
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,720
Turn right!

514
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,610
Step forward.

515
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,730
You.

516
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,570
You. You.

517
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,120
You.

518
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,160
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,500
Down on the ground!

520
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,910
Turn left!

521
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,530
On the march.

522
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,830
How long have you been here?

523
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,950
Since last night.

524
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,580
I was pleased to see you.

525
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,840
They're going to start\Nthe final resettlement now.

526
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,010
We know what it means.

527
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,020
We sent someone out.\NZygmund, a good man.

528
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,020
His orders were to follow\Nthe trains out of Warsaw.

529
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,570
He got to Sokolow.

530
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,530
A man told him the tracks divided,\None branch's leading to Treblinka.

531
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,160
He said everyday freight trains\Ncarrying people from Warsaw...

532
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,370
branch off to Treblinka\Nand return empty.

533
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,580
No transports of food\Nare ever seen on that line.

534
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,840
The civilians are forbidden\Nto approach the Treblinka station.

535
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,180
They're exterminating us.

536
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,680
It won't take them long.

537
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,650
We are 60 thousand left,\Nout of half a million.

538
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,030
Mostly young people.

539
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,360
And this time we're gonna fight.

540
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,910
We're in good shape.

541
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,080
Organized.\NWe're prepared.

542
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,130
If you need help, I...

543
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,940
You! Come here!

544
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,780
Shit!

545
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

546
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,870
I don't know what I was thinking.

547
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,550
Take this! Take this!

548
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,030
Take him away.

549
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,340
I hope you play the piano better\Nthan you carry bricks.

550
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,600
He won't last long\Nif he goes on like this.

551
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,720
I'll see if I can get him\Nsomething better.

552
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,160
Trouble.

553
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,880
Round up only the Jews!

554
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,050
Round up!\NOnly the Jews.

555
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,720
The Polish keep working.\NOnly the Jews.

556
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,980
I have good news for you.

557
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,110
There are rumors going around\Nthat we like to...

558
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,230
to resettle you.

559
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:41,200
I promise you that now\Nand in the future...

560
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:45,000
nothing else is planned.

561
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,340
For this reason, we put\Ninformation posters on the wall.

562
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:57,010
To show you our goodwill...

563
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,140
you should vote one of you\Nto be allowed...

564
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,390
to go in town daily...

565
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:10,980
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

566
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,690
and one loaf of bread\Nfor each of your workers.

567
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:21,320
So, why should we do something\Nlike this if we'd resettle you?

568
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:27,910
You can make good business\Nout of the things you don't eat.

569
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:35,090
Isn't that something that you Jews\Nare good in? Making money?

570
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,220
Dismiss them.

571
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:00,530
That one, with the string.\NThe others, tied by wire.

572
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,430
Now!

573
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,970
Majorek.

574
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,640
I have a favor to ask.

575
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,650
I want to get out of here.

576
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,860
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll\Nsurvive on the other side that's hard.

577
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,360
I know.

578
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,040
Last summer, I worked for a day\Nin the Zelazna Brama Square.

579
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,750
I saw someone I knew,\Nshe's an old friend.

580
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,420
A singer, her husband\Nis an actor.

581
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,050
I've filled their names down and\Ntheir address, if they're still there.

582
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:30,180
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej\NBogucki. They're good people.

583
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,140
Would you try to make contact?

584
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:40,980
You go to town everyday. Ask them\Nif they'd help me get out of here.

585
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,640
Have you got any plaster?

586
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,280
What are you up to?

587
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,410
What have you got there?

588
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,580
We are allowed to take\Nfood to the ghetto.

589
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:40,620
Three kilos of potato and bread.

590
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,920
Open it.

591
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:51,680
- It's only potatoes and bread.\N- You're lying. That's not true.

592
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,260
Open it.

593
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,420
Potatoes!

594
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:32,090
You Jews are all alike.

595
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,010
We reach you with a finger...

596
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,220
and you take the whole hand.

597
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:56,910
If you lie to me again,\NI'll kill you. Personally.

598
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,180
I've tried your friends.

599
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,770
- They don't live there anymore.\N- Did you make contact?

600
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,440
- Be ready to leave.\N- When?

601
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,570
- Soon.\N- Halt!

602
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,160
Shit! Shit!

603
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,030
Wait. What's going on here?

604
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,910
Take this! Take this!

605
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:52,210
I'll teach you some discipline,\Nyou dirty Jews.

606
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,930
Do you know why\Nyou're being hit?

607
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,270
- No.\N- Do you know why you're being hit?

608
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:07,020
- Why?\N- To celebrate New Year.

609
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,570
On the march!

610
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,400
March and sing!

611
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,570
Sing something nice!

612
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,280
Loud and clear!

613
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,120
Reunite tonight\NAnd follow the white eagle

614
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,460
Stand up and fight\NOur mortal enemies

615
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:33,510
Rise on the day\NLet's give them fire and brimstone

616
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:37,680
We'll do away\NThe Yoke of slavery

617
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,640
Punish and rout\NThe rapists of our nation

618
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,980
We'll slash them out\NTo save our dignity

619
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,680
Come.

620
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,920
I'm sorry.

621
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,880
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

622
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:08,870
We haven't much time.\NCome on.

623
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,460
We must hurry.

624
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,960
Here. See if this fit.

625
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:25,300
We have to keep moving you. Germans\Nare hunting down indiscriminately.

626
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:28,760
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

627
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,890
You better shave.\NUse my razor on the shelf.

628
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,740
You'll be looked after\Nby Gebczynski.

629
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,000
He's on the other side of town.

630
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,000
You stay there tonight,\Nthen we'll find you somewhere else.

631
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:01,920
- I'll bring you food.\N- Alright, let's go.

632
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,170
I'll show you where\Nyou're going to sleep.

633
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,500
You have to stay here\Nuntil tomorrow afternoon.

634
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,630
We have a flat for you near\Nthe ghetto wall. But it's safe.

635
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,430
It's not going to be very comfortable.

636
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,970
I'll be fine.

637
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,070
Thank you.

638
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,170
Here. Here. Give it to me.

639
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,800
Go as near to the front as possible,\Nto the German section.

640
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,940
DO NOT PASS

641
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,810
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

642
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,070
But you leave them open\Nduring the day. Don't forget.

643
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:19,410
Must feel better on\Nthis side of the wall, eh?

644
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,160
Yes.

645
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:27,000
But sometimes I'm still not sure\Nwhich side of the wall I'm on.

646
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,510
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

647
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,140
I'll come again.\NJanina will visit you twice a week.

648
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,810
To bring more food,\Nsee how you are.

649
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,310
Thank you.

650
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,860
This is very important.\NIn case of emergency...

651
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:51,360
I mean emergency,\Ngo to this address.

652
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,110
What do you mean you forgot?

653
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,280
What do you think I mean?\NI forgot, that's what I mean.

654
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:45,000
- You know, you treat me like dirt.\N- Because you are a dirt.

655
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,670
- Pig! Pig!\N- Bitch!

656
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,670
- Dirty pig!\N- You are a dirty pig!

657
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,590
Takes one to know one. Pig.

658
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,510
- You play like an angel.\N- Then why don't you listen?

659
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,930
- I'm listening.\N- Liar.

660
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,440
You fell asleep. Pig.

661
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:33,840
Spread out!\NWe're being attacked!

662
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,760
Take cover!

663
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,430
Shoot!

664
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,400
Take cover! Fire!

665
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:03,370
Come on, get out!

666
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:33,210
The attack was successful.

667
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,460
That building...

668
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,300
Turn that way!

669
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,940
Shoot!

670
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,170
Thank you.

671
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,550
- I wanted to come earlier, but...\N- No, thank you.

672
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,440
No-one thought\Nthey'd hold out so long.

673
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,150
I never should've come out. I should\Nhave stayed and fought with them.

674
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,820
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

675
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,900
Just be proud of them.

676
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:49,660
- My God, did they put up a fight!\N- Yes.

677
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,540
- So did the Germans.\N- They are in shock!

678
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:00,500
They didn't expect it. Nobody\Nexpected it. Jews fighting back.

679
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:05,510
- Who would have thought?\N- What good did it do?

680
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,720
What good?

681
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,350
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

682
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:15,350
They died with dignity.\NAnd you know something else?

683
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:20,440
Now the Poles will rise.\NWe are ready.

684
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,030
We'll fight too.\NYou'll see.

685
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,960
Get your things together.\NYou have to leave.

686
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,800
What? What's happened?

687
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,510
- I'm on the run.\N- What's happened?

688
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,850
The Gestapo found our weapons.\NThey've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

689
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,600
They're bound to find out about this\Nplace too. You must get away at once.

690
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,230
Where do you want me to go?

691
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,940
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

692
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,400
- Can I take my chances here?\N- That's your decision.

693
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:11,360
But when they storm the flat,\Nthrow yourself out the window...

694
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:13,410
don't let them get you alive.

695
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:16,830
I have poison on me.\NThey won't get me alive either.

696
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,240
Open up!

697
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:42,240
Open the door\Nor we'll call the police!

698
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:14,230
Are you from this flat?\NYou're not registered.

699
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,690
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just\Ncame to visit, but I missed him.

700
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,320
Have you got your identity card?

701
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:23,910
- Let me see your identity card.\N- Yes, of course.

702
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:29,080
- I want to see your identity card!\N- What's happening?

703
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,960
He's a Jew! A Jew!

704
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,040
Stop the Jew!

705
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,760
Don't let him out!\NStop him!

706
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,330
- Yes?\N- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

707
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:05,510
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.\N- Dorota.

708
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,810
Come in.

709
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,400
I'm sorry.

710
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:21,110
I was given this address and\NI'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

711
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,990
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

712
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,910
Come in.

713
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,880
Sit.

714
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,210
I need help.

715
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,930
He'll be back before curfew.

716
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:49,720
I've been in hiding.

717
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:54,430
- I need somewhere to stay.\N- He'll be here soon.

718
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,770
- How long have you been married?\N- Just over a year.

719
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:05,200
And how is Jurek?

720
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,110
Dead.

721
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:17,620
- When is your baby due?\N- Christmas.

722
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:22,090
This is not a good time to\Nhave children, but then...

723
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:27,800
This is my husband.\NWladyslaw Szpilman.

724
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:32,810
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.\N- Yes, I remember.

725
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,390
He said to contact you\Nonly in case of emergency.

726
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,480
Don't worry now.

727
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:52,660
We can't move you tonight.\NYou'll sleep on the sofa.

728
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:59,170
Excuse me.

729
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:06,170
I'm sorry,\Ncould I have a piece of bread?

730
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:09,130
Yes, of course.\NWe will eat.

731
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,430
Sit. Please, sit.

732
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,430
Thank you.

733
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,650
You're on a very German area.

734
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:31,280
On the opposite is a hospital taking\Nwounded from the Russian front.

735
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:36,490
And next door is the\NSchutzpolizei.

736
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:40,240
Safest place to be.

737
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,370
Right at the heart\Nof the lion's den.

738
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,670
I'll be locking you in.

739
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,880
No-one knows you're here,\Nso keep as quiet as possible.

740
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:06,430
All well?

741
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:09,270
Thank you.

742
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,320
This is Antek Szalas.\NHe'll be looking after you.

743
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,320
- How do you do?\N- How do you do?

744
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,320
Thank you.

745
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:26,530
I've given him a second key. He'll\Nbring food, see that you're alright.

746
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,660
He's with the underground,\Nhe's a good man.

747
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:37,960
- You don't remember me?\N- I don't think so.

748
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:41,680
Warsaw Radio.\NI was a technician.

749
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:45,430
I saw you almost everyday.

750
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:49,470
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.\N- It doesn't matter.

751
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:55,440
You've nothing to worry about.\NI'll visit often.

752
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,070
You'll be pleased to hear that\Nthe Allies are bombing Germany...

753
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:01,280
night after night,\Nafter night.

754
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,990
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

755
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:07,530
And the Russians are giving them\Nhell. It's the beginning of the end.

756
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,330
Let's hope so.

757
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:22,420
Come here.

758
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,800
Be careful with it.

759
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,680
That's it. Be careful.

760
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:58,290
Still alive then?

761
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:05,800
Here. Sausage, bread.

762
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:08,220
You still got that vodka?

763
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:26,530
- How long is this meant to last?\N- Not long now.

764
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:30,240
I think I've got jaundice.

765
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:34,290
Don't worry about that.\NIt just makes you look funny.

766
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:39,420
My grandfather was jilted by\Nhis girlfriend when he got jaundice.

767
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,540
Drink up.

768
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:45,420
Why didn't you come sooner?\NIt's been over two weeks...

769
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,430
Problems.

770
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,720
Money.

771
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,760
I've got to raise money\Nto buy the food.

772
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:56,850
I need things to sell,\Nit's not easy.

773
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:03,400
Here. Sell this.

774
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,950
Food is more important than time.

775
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,290
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!\NThe Allies have landed in France.

776
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,790
Russians will be here soon.

777
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:22,250
They'll beat the shit\Nout of the Germans...

778
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,130
any day now.

779
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:11,090
Wladek?

780
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:23,440
I knew it.\NI knew this would happen.

781
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:28,030
- I'll get a doctor.\N- You can't. It's too dangerous.

782
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:31,910
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.\N- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

783
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:34,530
- He's still a doctor.\N- No.

784
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,950
You stay. I'll go.

785
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,910
We came to say goodbye.

786
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:17,120
We're going to stay\Nwith my mother in Otwocks.

787
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:20,660
The baby is already there.\NIt's safer.

788
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:24,960
There's talk that the uprising\Nwill begin any day now.

789
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:29,250
That man Szalas should be shot.

790
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,970
He's been collecting money\Non your behalf all over Warsaw.

791
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,810
Apparently people gave generously,\Nso he collected a tidy sum.

792
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,980
My God.

793
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:55,490
The liver the size of a football.\NInflammation of the gall bladder...

794
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,620
but he'll leave.

795
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:04,910
I'll try to get him some laevulose,\Nbut it's not easy.

796
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,790
- Can you visit him again?\N- Who knows.

797
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,130
- Doctor, thank you.\N- Don't speak, rest.

798
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:19,260
Thank you so much for coming.

799
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,140
We've brought you some food.

800
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:27,190
I'll prepare something now\Nfor you, then we must go.

801
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:11,110
I'll throw a grenade!

802
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,910
There's a wounded man over there!

803
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,950
Come.

804
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,500
Watch out! Watch out!

805
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:31,580
- I'll go get help!\N- Hurry!

806
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:36,260
Come on! Bring the litter!

807
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:42,720
Go back inside!

808
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:34,460
Get out, get out in the streets!

809
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:38,460
Get out now! The Germans\Nhave surrounded the building!

810
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:23,840
Somebody...\NSomebody help me!

811
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:24,900
Are you alright?\NThere's too much dust.

812
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,860
I'll check this side.\NDon't worry.

813
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:32,530
Be careful!

814
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:40,630
- Heinrich?\N- I'm checking!

815
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:45,710
Is there anybody here?

816
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,930
- Come on down!\N- Alright, I'm coming.

817
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,970
Come on, pile them up.

818
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:12,520
Throw it.

819
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:39,730
We have to mark everything.

820
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:41,740
Come on.

821
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:45,330
What are you doing here?

822
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:52,130
Who are you?

823
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:59,840
- Do you understand?\N- Yes.

824
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:04,220
What are you doing?

825
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,980
I was...

826
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:15,190
trying to open this can.

827
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,530
Do you live here?

828
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:22,910
Do you work here?

829
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:24,820
No.

830
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:31,000
What do you do for a living?

831
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:35,840
I am...

832
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:40,470
I was a pianist.

833
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:44,800
Pianist?

834
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:05,570
Come.

835
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,770
Play something.

836
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,760
Are you hiding here?

837
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:01,180
Jew?

838
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,600
Where are you hiding yourself?

839
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:10,230
In the attic.

840
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,820
Show it to me.

841
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,590
Have you got anything to eat?

842
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:33,520
According to them,\Nit's very important that...

843
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:42,030
Attention!

844
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,790
- At ease.\N- At ease.

845
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:54,020
Jew?

846
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:09,910
Please.

847
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:12,370
What does it mean,\Nall that shooting?

848
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:15,670
The Russians,\Non the other side of the river.

849
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:20,500
You just have to hold on\Na couple of weeks, not more.

850
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:54,810
- What's going on?\N- We're leaving.

851
02:13:57,730 --> 02:14:01,060
- Are the Russians here?\N- Not yet.

852
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:07,860
I don't know how to thank you.

853
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,530
Thank God, not me.

854
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:17,580
He wants us to survive. At least,\Nwe have to believe in that.

855
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:30,760
Here. Take it.

856
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,100
- And you?\N- I have another one. Warmer.

857
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:44,110
What are you going to do\Nwhen this is over?

858
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:50,280
I'll play piano again at\Nthe Polish radio station.

859
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,950
Tell me your name.

860
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,830
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

861
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:58,120
Szpilman.

862
02:15:02,330 --> 02:15:05,210
Perfect name for a pianist.

863
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:30,130
German! German!

864
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,950
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

865
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:58,990
I'm Polish!

866
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,490
- Come out with your hands up!\N- Please! I beg of you!

867
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:07,870
Don't shoot, don't shoot.\NI beg you, I'm a Polish.

868
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:10,090
Come down!

869
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:17,760
Please, I'm Polish.\NPlease.

870
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:20,140
He's Polish.

871
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:25,270
Yes, he's Polish.

872
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,980
Why the fucking coat?

873
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:32,320
I'm cold.

874
02:17:51,330 --> 02:17:54,340
Look at them.\NGerman fuckers!

875
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,920
Murderers! Murderers!

876
02:17:58,170 --> 02:18:01,390
- Dirty bastards!\N- Assassins!

877
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:05,060
- Bastards!\N- Look at you now!

878
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:09,190
You took everything I had.\NMe, a musician.

879
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:12,810
You took my violin,\Nyou took my soul.

880
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:19,360
Musician?

881
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:22,530
Are you a musician?

882
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:25,660
Do you know...

883
02:18:25,990 --> 02:18:29,160
a pianist called Szpilman,\Nfrom the Polish radio station?

884
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:34,590
- Of course I know him.\N- I helped him to hide himself.

885
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:37,510
Tell him I'm here.

886
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,470
Ask him to help me.

887
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:46,310
- What's your name?\N- Hosenfeld.

888
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,770
What?

889
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:32,450
It was here, I'm certain of it.

890
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,620
Well, it's not here now.

891
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:40,960
I shouted, abused them. I'm not\Nproud of it, but that's what I did.

892
02:20:41,210 --> 02:20:42,630
I stood where you are now.

893
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:47,180
There was a barbed wire\Nand this German came up to me.

894
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:52,180
- You didn't catch his name?\N- No.

895
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:57,650
I'll ask at the factory.\NThey may know something.
