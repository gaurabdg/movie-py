2
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,000
You want to be Atticus Finch. Good!

3
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,222
- I like him.
- Why?

4
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:35,535
- Well, he's honest.
- Yes.

5
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:38,504
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

6
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,540
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

7
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:43,046
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

8
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,501
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't!

9
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,669
Who was the woman
that came every day?

10
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,381
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

11
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,428
- What about Boo?
- What?

12
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:57,226
<i>Boo's the most interesting character
in To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

13
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,350
Excuse me.

14
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,601
I'm a teacher. "Xmas" isn't
in the English language.

15
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,272
It's either "Merry Christmas"...

16
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,112
...or "Happy Holidays."

17
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,366
Thank you.

18
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:14,027
Sure.

19
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:20,997
Tell me about Livia.

20
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:25,292
She killed everyone so her son
could be king. Like Nixon.

21
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:31,253
Please, please, please.

22
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,885
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

23
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:39,431
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

24
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:43,016
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine.

25
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:45,522
Wait. You've been kissing.

26
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:48,269
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

27
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,200
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

28
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,199
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

29
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,289
What you got under your coat?

30
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:09,797
- Why can't we listen to our music?
- It's about drugs and promiscuous sex.

31
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,836
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

32
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,627
The poetry of drugs
and promiscuous sex.

33
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,258
Honey, they're on pot.

34
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:24,346
First, it was butter.
Then sugar and white flour.

35
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:28,645
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock'n'roll, motorcycles.

36
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,444
Then, it was celebrating
Christmas in September...

37
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:35,326
...when it wouldn't
be commercialized.

38
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:39,485
- What else will you ban?
- You wanna rebel against knowledge.

39
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:44,746
- I give you the Cliffs Notes on life.
- We're like nobody else I know!

40
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,505
I'm a college professor. Why can't
I teach my own kids? Use me.

41
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:53,001
Darryl says you use knowledge
to keep me down.

42
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:58,379
He says I'm a "yes" person and you
are raising us in a "no" environment.

43
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,350
Clearly, Darryl
doesn't hear "no" much.

44
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,849
I can't live here! I hate you!

45
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,055
- William hates you.
- I don't.

46
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:08,479
You don't even know the truth.

47
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,977
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

48
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,985
This is a house of lies!

49
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,573
There it is.

50
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:21,912
- Your sister used the "F" word.
- I think she said "feck."

51
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,533
- What's the difference?
- The letter "U."

52
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,487
Are you really in our grade?

53
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:09,575
Hey, guys! Check it out.
William doesn't have any pubes.

54
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,960
- How old are you, man?
- He's not a man.

55
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,840
- He's a baby.
- Bet he doesn't get zits.

56
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,504
Everyone has hair.
What's wrong?

57
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:22,168
- How old are you, like 2?
- How pathetic!

58
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,962
Where are your pubes?

59
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,675
I had them.

60
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,101
I shaved them off.

61
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,277
He's a funny guy.

62
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,610
See you, pubes.

63
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,451
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.

64
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,665
Put on your seat belt.

65
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:58,166
We got our annuals.

66
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:01,382
- Received your annual.
- Right, received.

67
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,600
I look so much younger
than everyone.

68
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,050
Enjoy it while you can.

69
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,934
Mom, it's time.

70
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,483
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Pull over.

71
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:23,144
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

72
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,452
He knows how old he is.

73
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,997
Kids make fun of him
because he looks young.

74
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,624
Nobody includes him.
They call him "The Narc."

75
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,544
- They do?
- What's a narc?

76
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:45,167
- A narcotics officer.
- What's wrong with that?

77
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,720
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

78
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,593
I'm 12.
She skipped me a grade.

79
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,884
Big deal. I'm a year younger.
They're 13, I'm 12.

80
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:00,179
Aren't I?

81
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:04,444
I put you in first grade when
you were 5 and didn't tell you.

82
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,604
- So I'm how old?
- This will scar him forever.

83
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:12,027
Don't be Cleopatra.
We have to be Mom and Dad.

84
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:16,739
You put too much pressure on him.
When he rebels in some odd way...

85
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,830
...don't blame me.
- How old am I?

86
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,834
You skipped an extra grade.

87
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,794
You're 11.

88
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:27,288
Eleven?

89
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,298
So you skipped fifth grade.

90
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:34,426
- They pad the grades too much.
- Eleven?!

91
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:40,101
You also skipped kindergarten.
I taught it to you when you were 4.

92
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,099
This explains so much.

93
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:53,325
- You've robbed him of an adolescence.
- Adolescence is a marketing tool.

94
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,868
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty...

95
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,825
...but you'll have to
shine it on for a while.

96
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,750
Who needs a crowd?

97
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:06,453
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

98
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:07,910
You're unique.

99
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,005
You're two years ahead.

100
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:13,253
Take those extra years
and do what you want.

101
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,139
Go to Europe. Take a look around.

102
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,180
See what you like.

103
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,975
Follow your dream.

104
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,391
You'll still be the youngest lawyer.
Your dad was proud.

105
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:29,106
He knew you were a predominately
accelerated child.

106
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:31,521
What about me?

107
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:37,023
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

108
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,367
Somebody's gotta be normal
around here.

109
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,075
11.

110
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,873
This song explains why I'm leaving
home to become a stewardess.

111
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:57,296
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

112
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,090
I love you.

113
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:35,829
Man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

114
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,725
One day...

115
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,311
...you'll be cool.

116
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,277
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

117
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:04,152
Watch the plant.

118
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,534
You're 18 and I can't stop you.

119
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,670
She'll be back.

120
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,513
Maybe not soon.

121
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:50,071
<i>Here's a theory
for you to disregard...</i>

122
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:52,988
<i>... completely.</i>

123
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:58,952
Music, you know, true music
not just rock'n'roll, chooses you.

124
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:02,786
It lives in your car, or alone,
on your headphones...

125
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,377
...with vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

126
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,916
It's a place apart...

127
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:12,963
...from the benign lap of America.

128
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:16,425
Did you know
"The Letter" by The Box Tops...

129
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:21,299
...was a minute, 58 seconds long?
It means nothing. Nil.

130
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:24,269
They take two minutes
to accomplish...

131
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:28,558
...what Jethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish.

132
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:32,309
You see, this is fatuous,
pseudo blubber.

133
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:36,146
You know, which is fine...

134
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,404
...but to foist it off as art...

135
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:41,155
The Doors? Jim Morrison?

136
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,243
He's a drunk, posing as a poet.

137
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:46,035
- I like them.
- Give me The Guess Who.

138
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:51,374
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons, which makes them poetic.

139
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:57,003
<i>It's an honour to have the great
rock critic and editor of Creem...</i>

140
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:00,136
...back home in San Diego,
Lester Bangs.

141
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:03,015
<i>Live, "American Woman"?</i>

142
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:07,762
Have you ever...? The most brilliant
piece of gobbledygook ever!

143
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:11,684
Give me some
"White LightlWhite Heat."

144
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,227
Lggy Pop!

145
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:18,442
Amen! Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist.

146
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:21,989
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

147
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:26,780
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom and here is lggy Pop.

148
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,247
So you're the kid sending me those
articles from the school newspaper.

149
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,796
I've done stuff for
a local underground paper.

150
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:47,880
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.

151
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,553
You'll meet again
on their journey to the middle.

152
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,683
Your writing is good. Too bad
you missed rock'n'roll. It's over.

153
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,893
- Over?
- It's over.

154
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:04,354
You got here for the death rattle.
Last gasp. Last grope.

155
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,611
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you use?

156
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,365
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

157
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:12,784
You like Lou Reed?

158
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,368
Early stuff.
Lately, he's trying to be Bowie.

159
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,544
He should just be himself.

160
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,582
But if Bowie's doing Lou...

161
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,085
...and Lou's doing Bowie,
Lou's still doing Lou.

162
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,551
If you like Lou.

163
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,758
- You take drugs?
- No.

164
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,179
Smart kid.

165
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,726
I used to do speed.

166
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,108
And sometimes a little cough syrup.

167
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,562
I'd stay up all night,
writing and writing.

168
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,352
I mean, like 25 pages of dribble.

169
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:48,693
You know, about the Faces,
or Coltrane.

170
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,946
Just to fucking write.

171
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:56,201
All right.
It's been nice to meet you.

172
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,706
Keep sending me your stuff.

173
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,753
I can't spend all day
talking to my many fans.

174
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,542
I understand.

175
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,138
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, goodbye.

176
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,477
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,982
You need a ride?

178
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:35,406
No, man, I took the bus.

179
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:40,781
Once you go to L.A., you'll
have friends like crazy.

180
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:44,667
But they'll be fake friends.
They'll try to corrupt you.

181
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,047
You look honest,
they'll tell you everything.

182
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:52,090
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

183
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,807
- Is it okay if I...
- lf you're to be a rock journalist...

184
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:05,274
You don't get much, but you'll get
free records from the record company.

185
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,782
There's just fucking nothing
about you that is controversial.

186
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,695
God, it'll get ugly.
They'll buy you drinks.

187
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:23,124
You'll meet girls.
They'll fly you places, offer drugs.

188
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:26,121
It sounds great,
but they aren't friends.

189
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:30,549
They want snobbish stories
about the rock stars' genius.

190
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,343
They will ruin rock and strangle
everything we love about it.

191
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,927
They're trying to buy respectability...

192
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,007
...for a forum that's gloriously
and righteously dumb.

193
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,718
You're smart enough to know that.

194
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:49,316
The day it ceases to be dumb
is the day it ceases to be real.

195
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,646
Then it just becomes
an industry of cool.

196
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:57,358
You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.

197
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:01,869
I mean, the war is over. They won.

198
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,164
And 99% of what passes
for rock these days...

199
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:08,210
...silence is more compelling.

200
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:14,050
So I think you should turn around,
go back and be a lawyer or something.

201
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,805
I can tell from your face
that you won't.

202
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,635
I can give you $35.

203
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:27,386
- Give me 1000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

204
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,597
Yeah, yeah.

205
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:44,036
You have to make your reputation
on being honest...

206
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,990
...and...

207
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,665
...you know, unmerciful.

208
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,246
Honest.

209
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,796
Unmerciful.

210
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:59,548
If you get into a jam,
you can call me. I stay up late.

211
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,060
Look, a generation of Cinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

212
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:14,394
You wanted to be Abraham Lincoln.
You wanted to be Atticus Finch.

213
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,350
You want to get high?

214
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,945
I just have to listen.

215
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,200
- That's what Lester said.
- As long as this is just a hobby.

216
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:27,910
I'll pick you up right here
at 11:00 sharp.

217
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,992
If you get lost,
use the family whistle.

218
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,158
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

219
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,510
Don't take drugs!

220
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,880
"Don't take drugs!"

221
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,350
Yes, Mother!

222
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,909
Hi, I'm William Miller.

223
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,829
<i>I'm from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.</i>

224
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,335
Not on the list.

225
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,174
- Sir, I'm a journalist...
- You're not on the list.

226
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,347
Go to the top of the ramp
with the girls.

227
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,980
We won't bite!

228
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,228
What happens after I go to...

229
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,821
Who are you with?

230
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:55,283
Me?

231
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:59,329
- I'm with myself.
- Who are you with? What band?

232
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:04,421
I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

233
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,123
I'm not... Not a... You know.

234
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,759
You're not a what?

235
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,426
You're not a what?

236
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:17,924
I'm not a...

237
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,426
...groupie.

238
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:24,185
We are not groupies.

239
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:27,645
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

240
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:31,646
Groupies sleep with rock stars
because they're famous.

241
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:35,033
We're here for the music.
We are "Band Aids."

242
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:39,786
- She ran a school for Band Aids.
- We don't have intercourse.

243
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:44,043
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.

244
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:47,954
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.

245
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,337
It's a long story.

246
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,342
I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.

247
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,345
She changed everything.

248
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:59,723
She was the one who said,
"No more sex.

249
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,556
No exploiting
our bodies and hearts."

250
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,143
- Right.
- Just blow jobs, that's it.

251
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:09,850
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

252
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:18,903
- It's all happening.
- This is our journalist friend.

253
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,536
Journalist friend,
meet Polexia Aphrodisia...

254
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,622
...Estrella Starr...

255
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,918
...and you are...
- William Miller.

256
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:31,706
- Here comes Sabbath!
- Ozzy, Tony, it's us!

257
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,922
It's me, Polexia!

258
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,016
I think I saw Sapphire.

259
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:48,103
"Does anybody remember laughter?"

260
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:49,478
Sapphire!

261
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:52,395
Come on!

262
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:56,023
Passes, girls!
Come and get them!

263
00:24:57,073 --> 00:25:00,192
- Oh, no, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

264
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:02,036
He's with us.

265
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:06,289
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this if I can.

266
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:27,808
Come on, boys, pick it up!
We're an hour and a half late.

267
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,268
I'm coming, I'm coming.

268
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:43,149
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

269
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:52,959
<i>I'm a journalist for Creem magazine.</i>

270
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,541
Oh, the Enemy. A rock writer.

271
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,922
I'd like to interview you
or your band.

272
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:02,667
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?!

273
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:06,090
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

274
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,885
Russell, Jeff...

275
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:16,646
...Ed, Larry.
I really love your band.

276
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:20,358
The song "Fever Dog"
is a big step forward for you.

277
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,987
And you guys producing it
instead of Glyn Johns...

278
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:29,241
...that was the right thing to do.
And Russell, the guitar sound...

279
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,872
...is incendiary.

280
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,539
Incendiary.

281
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,457
Way to go.

282
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,967
Hey, man! Don't stop there.

283
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,964
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean "fuck off."

284
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,980
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

285
00:26:57,231 --> 00:27:00,730
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who belong.

286
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,282
Hey, Red Dog!

287
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:10,694
We're playing you
tomorrow night, man.

288
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,449
- Yeah?
- How you doing, brother?

289
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,326
Good to see you.

290
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,625
The Allman Brothers Band's
number one roadie.

291
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:22,879
- How are the guys?
- Having a ball, man. Having a ball.

292
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:26,754
We have an Allman Brothers
Band party, man.

293
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:31,009
Everybody's boogying,
getting off. It's like family.

294
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:34,634
We got these now.
Check that out.

295
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:38,519
You can taste the colour
with your mind.

296
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,521
- You'll be in Maryland?
- Yeah.

297
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:46,359
All right. Dickey and Gregg send
you their love.

298
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,488
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy, brother.

299
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:51,240
Good, man.

300
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:59,872
People have a hard time explaining
rock, really explain rock'n'roll.

301
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:03,585
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

302
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:07,580
Rock'n'roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking...

303
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,297
...and it's not about money
and popularity.

304
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:14,218
Although, some money
would be nice.

305
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,761
It's a voice that says,
"Here I am...

306
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:20,468
...and fuck you
if you can't understand me."

307
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:23,687
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

308
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,645
That means rock'n'roll
can save the world...

309
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,774
...all of us together.

310
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:33,524
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that "thing."

311
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:37,946
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

312
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:42,201
- Wait, what am I talking about?
- The buzz.

313
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:46,242
The buzz, and the chicks,
the whatever...

314
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,625
...is an offshoot of the buzz.

315
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,918
Like you saying you liked
"Fever Dog." That is the fucking buzz!

316
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:10,147
Found you a pass.

317
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,484
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

318
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:16,981
Oh, Stillwater.

319
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:39,090
Now you're mysterious.

320
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:44,932
How old are you?

321
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:48,056
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

322
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,438
How old are we really?

323
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:54,354
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

324
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,438
Actually, I'm 16.

325
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,563
Me too.

326
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,819
Isn't it funny?
The truth just sounds different.

327
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm 15.

328
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,994
What's your real name?

329
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,373
I'll never tell.

330
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,086
The Enemy!

331
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:23,255
Russell! Hey.

332
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,215
This is Penny Lane.

333
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,973
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

334
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,350
Pleasure.

335
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:38,108
- Penny Lane, like the song.
- Have we met?

336
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,170
Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

337
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,093
It's...

338
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:13,804
It's not what you put into it.
It's what you leave out.

339
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,804
Listen to Marvin Gaye, a song
like "What's Happening Brother?"

340
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:21,974
There's a single "woo" at the end
of the second verse.

341
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:26,691
- You know that single woo?
- Yeah! I know that woo!

342
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:31,245
Yeah! That's what you remember.
It's the silly things.

343
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:35,499
The mistakes. There's only one
and it makes the song.

344
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:41,213
It's what you leave out. That's
rock'n'roll, what you leave out.

345
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:45,214
- You're the enemy. Are you 18?
- Yes.

346
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:48,380
There you go, still young
enough to be honest.

347
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:51,419
Bring the lights down.

348
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,975
Hey, get the Enemy in here.

349
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,287
- San Diego!
- Ready, baby?

350
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:26,790
<i>Good evening, San Diego!</i>

351
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,841
Stand right over there.

352
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,428
<i>Would you please welcome...</i>

353
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,803
<i>... from Troy, Michigan:</i>

354
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:38,264
Stillwater!

355
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,619
You want to come to L.A?

356
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,960
We'll be at the Riot House all week.

357
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,005
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

358
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:38,506
The Continental Hyatt House.

359
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,630
It's on Sunset Strip.

360
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,295
Oh, yeah, right. Sunset Strip.

361
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:47,466
Well, tell your friend...

362
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,897
...Miss Penny Lane to call me.
Tell her:

363
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:56,856
It ain't California without her.
We want her around, like last summer.

364
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,150
Say it just like that.

365
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:03,109
- Got it.
- I'm under "Harry Houdini."

366
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:06,449
I get it.

367
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,909
- Come on, let's blow this spot!
- Hey, Enemy.

368
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:12,835
Come up to L.A.,
we'll talk some more.

369
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:16,288
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.

370
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:21,173
Scully, Ed. See you, Mick, Gregg.
Later, guys.

371
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:24,804
Bye, Opie.

372
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:28,504
Bye.

373
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:33,008
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see you later, man.

374
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:35,809
The Wheel.
Frosty.

375
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,390
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.

376
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,691
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

377
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:43,820
Penny, you just missed Russell.

378
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:47,483
He's at the Riot House
and said for you to call.

379
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,868
He's under the name Harry Houdini.

380
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:57,579
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

381
00:35:57,837 --> 00:35:59,960
He had a message. He said:

382
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:04,626
"It's not California without you.
We want you around like last summer."

383
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,760
No! He said, "Tell her it ain't
California without..."

384
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,682
- I get the gist.
- Right.

385
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:15,052
So how well do you guys
know each other?

386
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:26,189
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

387
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:30,118
I think I live in a different world.

388
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:33,950
Speaking of the world...

389
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,865
...l've made a decision.

390
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,043
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for one year.

391
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,377
I need a new crowd.

392
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:53,424
Do you want to come?

393
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,976
Yes.

394
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,976
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

395
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:04,267
Do you want to come?

396
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,016
Yes, yes.

397
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:11,354
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.

398
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:15,692
It's all happening.

399
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,745
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

400
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:22,000
You all right?

401
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,707
Yeah, yeah. Great.

402
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:46,390
<i>And it's not about money
and popularity.</i>

403
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,407
<i>And the chicks are great.</i>

404
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:05,709
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey.

405
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:17,051
- So, your sister's a stewardess now.
- Yeah.

406
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:18,805
She and Mom are still...

407
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:23,673
I'd say not speaking,
but I don't know that they ever did.

408
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,302
The things we did
inside these walls.

409
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:28,846
That's okay.
I don't wanna know.

410
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:32,150
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.

411
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,986
Okay, okay.

412
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:38,278
You seem cooler.

413
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,619
I am thinking
about going to Morocco.

414
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:46,039
Tell me if you need
a little help with your mom.

415
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:50,294
- A little may not be enough.
- She still freaks me out.

416
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,626
- She's famous.
- Listen...

417
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:55,675
Go ahead and do
whatever you were doing.

418
00:38:55,884 --> 00:39:00,344
- I'm just gonna hang in here a moment.
- Okay.

419
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:20,903
I worry about drunk drivers.

420
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,359
Mom, I'm 15.

421
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,155
Right?

422
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:28,242
Yes. You're 15.

423
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:31,624
And, here's that money
I owe you.

424
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:35,587
Your father's favourite joke.
I don't do it as well.

425
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:38,466
No, I thought
that was pretty good.

426
00:39:38,674 --> 00:39:41,296
Small bills on the outside.
Call if they're drunk.

427
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:44,838
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

428
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:48,592
- And don't take drugs.
- Very funny.

429
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,094
See? Sense of humour.

430
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:54,973
Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

431
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,771
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

432
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,272
Love you.

433
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:01,733
Goodbye.

434
00:40:16,754 --> 00:40:19,374
I always tell the girls,
"Never take it seriously.

435
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:22,211
Never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

436
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,340
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

437
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:26,883
And if you ever get lonely...

438
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:31,474
...you just go to the record store
and visit your friends."

439
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,684
- So you and Russell...
- No!

440
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:39,898
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

441
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,946
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

442
00:40:56,166 --> 00:41:00,662
These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'll pretend I don't know them.

443
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,002
Does Alice know you're here?

444
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:06,715
I'm just showing my very dear friend
William Miller around.

445
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,465
He's a very good friend
of Lester Bangs.

446
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,049
I'm responsible for his moral conduct.

447
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:16,052
Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock'n'roll.

448
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:18,891
I'm retired.
And don't argue with me!

449
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:24,390
- Retired? Again?
- It's Reg. Humble Pie's road manager.

450
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,727
Penny, come to Portland with us.

451
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:29,986
- Have we met?
- Have we met?!

452
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,149
I've made a decision.
I'm going travelling to India.

453
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,695
And then, I'll learn to play
the violin.

454
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,615
Then, I'll go to college
for one year.

455
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:44,168
There's nothing they can teach you
in college.

456
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,921
Call Alice, under the name
Bob Hope.

457
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:51,676
- I heard you were with Russell.
- Please, I throw the little ones back!

458
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,381
I lost my head!

459
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:58,258
Martin Bell's a fucking asshole.
And I'm in love with Jeff.

460
00:41:58,477 --> 00:41:59,591
Polexia!

461
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,769
Harry Houdini, please.

462
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,192
- Houdini. Harry Houdini!
- It was Sable.

463
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:13,689
- Who's Sable?
- We had this really great night.

464
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:18,907
And he said it was going to mean
something. And I'm in love with Jeff!

465
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,791
I saw them on the 7th floor.

466
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,917
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. John Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

467
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,631
Mr. Robert Plant signed...

468
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:40,756
...my T-shirt five minutes ago.

469
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,137
Dude, please don't smear it.

470
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,187
He touched this pen.

471
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,895
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

472
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,646
He tours with them,
but not "with" them.

473
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,691
Yeah, they're on the 12th floor now.

474
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,190
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

475
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:06,409
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

476
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,911
William Miller.

477
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,335
Hey, you're that comedian.

478
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,998
- Leonard!
- Blow me!

479
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,919
Okay, time to put on
the lampshade.

480
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,431
Ladies and gentlemen!

481
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,061
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

482
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:34,934
...for the captain has turned on
the "No Smoking" sign.

483
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,895
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

484
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:41,565
...and in their full
upright position.

485
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,835
The hell with it.

486
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,961
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

487
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:58,669
Thank you. Thank you.

488
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:08,475
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

489
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:10,561
...about him.

490
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:18,273
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

491
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:21,192
...but he goes right for her.

492
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,614
Act Three, in which it all plays out
the way she planned it.

493
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,497
She'll eat him alive.

494
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:34,955
We've gotta stop them.

495
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:36,829
Stop them?

496
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:42,546
You were her excuse for coming here.

497
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,508
I need ice.

498
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:04,114
I'm worried about people
using her.

499
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:09,858
She brings out the good in everybody
else, but what do they do for her?

500
00:45:10,578 --> 00:45:14,363
It kills me.
Do you have any pot?

501
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:18,203
No. Not on me.

502
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:22,498
- Do you smoke?
- No.

503
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:26,748
But I grow it.

504
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,294
Yeah.

505
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:32,760
- Grow it.
- You're funny.

506
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:38,770
Funny. If you were only taller and
English and rich and a guitar player.

507
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,306
And older.

508
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,228
I'd...
I'd be somebody else.

509
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:48,482
Yeah, good point.

510
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:52,486
The Enemy.

511
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:56,699
I'm always around if
you wanna talk more.

512
00:45:56,915 --> 00:45:58,658
- Okay.
- All right.

513
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:03,125
Bless me, Father,
for I may sin tonight.

514
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,393
How does it end?

515
00:46:30,614 --> 00:46:31,693
What?

516
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:36,951
The story about the girl who dumps the
guy who has the ex, ex-wife.

517
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:40,778
Calls her a hundred, okay...

518
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:46,420
...five times and doesn't even leave
a pass in San Diego.

519
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,422
Wake up.

520
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:51,174
I'm retired.

521
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:57,545
I never believed you anyway.
You're too good-looking and talented.

522
00:46:57,766 --> 00:47:01,265
You're retired like Frank Sinatra
is retired.

523
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:06,224
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell
you what rock'n'roll will miss.

524
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:09,353
The day that you truly retire.

525
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:15,190
The way you turn a hotel room
into a home.

526
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:18,112
The way you pick up strays
wherever you go.

527
00:47:19,828 --> 00:47:23,613
The way you know the words
to every song.

528
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,406
Every song.
Especially the bad ones.

529
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:29,200
Mostly the bad ones.

530
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:33,503
That green coat
in the middle of summer.

531
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:38,379
The real name
that you won't reveal.

532
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:45,514
I could keep going,
but my glass is full.

533
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,938
Damn.

534
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:10,534
Come to Arizona?

535
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:12,743
Never.

536
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:17,624
We leave Thursday morning at 9 a.m.,
and pack light this time. Jesus.

537
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,937
<i>- William Miller?
- This is he.</i>

538
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,524
<i>This is Ben Fong-Torres.
I'm the music editor at Rolling Stone.</i>

539
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,689
<i>We got some copies of your stories
from the San Diego Door.</i>

540
00:48:41,074 --> 00:48:43,861
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

541
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:47,783
<i>"Voice of God," "Howling Dogs,"
"The Spirit of Rock'n'roll."</i>

542
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:50,245
<i>- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.</i>

543
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,874
Thanks. Thanks.

544
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:55,499
I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

545
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,795
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

546
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:06,337
"Hardworking band makes good."
New album out, their third.

547
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,840
Starting to do something. Crazy.

548
00:49:09,184 --> 00:49:12,600
<i>Let's do 3000 words.
We'll join the band on the road.</i>

549
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:14,597
Don't let the band pay for anything.

550
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,815
We can only pay, let me see,
3000 words...

551
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,733
$700.

552
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:25,772
All right, a grand.

553
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:29,870
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?

554
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:33,494
<i>- Yeah.
- What college?</i>

555
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:37,076
<i>I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.</i>

556
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:47,045
I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

557
00:49:47,597 --> 00:49:49,884
<i>- Crazy.
- Crazy.</i>

558
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,048
<i>Stillwater?</i>

559
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,935
<i>Beware, beware...</i>

560
00:49:54,144 --> 00:49:56,717
<i>...of Rolling Stone.
They'll change your story...</i>

561
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:01,648
...they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill.

562
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,440
Besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

563
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:08,865
You got starry eyes, my friend.

564
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:12,612
Look, do the story.

565
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,157
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for you.

566
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:19,198
Remember this: Don't do it...

567
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,745
...to make friends with people
who are trying to use you...

568
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:27,169
...to further
the big-business desire...

569
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:30,760
<i>... to glorify worthless rock stars
like Stillwater.</i>

570
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,890
<i>Don't let those
swill merchants rewrite you.</i>

571
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:37,726
<i>- "Swill merchants." That's good.
- Yeah, swill merchants.</i>

572
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,268
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.

573
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:45,561
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

574
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:49,231
No, no, no, no.

575
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:53,066
No more than four days and I want
a phone number where you are.

576
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:57,538
Call me twice a day, and do not
miss more than one test!

577
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,785
And no drugs.

578
00:51:04,379 --> 00:51:07,333
Oh, this is a big mistake.

579
00:51:28,444 --> 00:51:31,279
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

580
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:47,246
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

581
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:51,081
I was wondering if we could
talk when we get to Phoenix.

582
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:54,924
I want to interview everybody
and want to start with...

583
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:57,461
...just you and me.
- Absolutely.

584
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:00,338
I've got a thing in a couple days.

585
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:04,258
- What?
- Oh, it's a thing.

586
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:07,095
Where you go there
to graduate.

587
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:09,806
School.

588
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:14,184
I never graduated.
Look what happened.

589
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:17,191
You're here interviewing me.

590
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:21,864
No, no, no, no.

591
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:27,955
<i>Don't put that in Rolling Stone.
In our bios, we all graduated.</i>

592
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:29,959
Him with honours.

593
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:32,958
We'll figure out something
later, okay?

594
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:36,006
Just enjoy the ride.

595
00:52:36,258 --> 00:52:39,095
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

596
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,779
I need to stay in your room.
Russell's in a bad mood.

597
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:06,037
<i>He's very Bob Dylan in Don't
Look Back. He's trying to write.</i>

598
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:09,081
Yeah, sure.

599
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,749
- Yeah?
- Sure.

600
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,703
You okay?

601
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:14,877
Yeah.

602
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,394
Come by in a few minutes
for that interview.

603
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,067
Sure.

604
00:53:39,904 --> 00:53:41,813
Is this Mr. Miller?

605
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:43,110
Yeah.

606
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,525
You have a message from Elaine.

607
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,065
Your mother.

608
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:49,369
She's a handful.

609
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:53,661
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

610
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:56,877
Tell her to stop.

611
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,386
I'm worried, man.

612
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:11,758
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

613
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:13,803
<i>But it's Rolling Stone.</i>

614
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:18,273
He looks harmless, but he represents
the magazine that trashed "Layla"...

615
00:54:18,524 --> 00:54:21,976
...broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

616
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:26,448
Don't forget the rules. He is
the Enemy. He writes what he sees.

617
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:30,282
If I don't get into a room
and take a Valium...

618
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:33,448
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

619
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:36,161
You're gonna get me in trouble.

620
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:40,211
You're so trying to get
me into so much trouble.

621
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:43,788
Oh, my God.

622
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:47,752
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

623
00:54:58,063 --> 00:54:59,641
Housekeeping.

624
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:02,233
Housekeeping.

625
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:04,813
Go away!

626
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:07,819
Should I come by later?

627
00:55:08,198 --> 00:55:11,781
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood!

628
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:14,490
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

629
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,828
You okay?

630
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,412
Yeah.

631
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,241
Go away!

632
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:25,665
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

633
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,085
Go away!

634
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:29,629
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

635
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:34,310
The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

636
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:39,952
Vocal stylings of
Jeff "Bebay." Jeff "Babey." "Babay."

637
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,039
- "Bebe."
- Bebe.

638
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:45,328
"Fever Dog."

639
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,701
The band is Stillwater.

640
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:51,583
Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

641
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:02,048
Look at the dogs wearing the funny
hats juggling just for you...

642
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:05,220
...freaks and family.

643
00:57:05,437 --> 00:57:06,764
It's Quince...

644
00:57:07,146 --> 00:57:10,764
...with Stillwater, here, live.
It's the Night Circus.

645
00:57:12,735 --> 00:57:15,688
Every minute a baby
is born somewhere.

646
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:18,193
Life. Death.

647
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,945
Hermetically sealed bags
of human emotion.

648
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:23,610
Bags of love.

649
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:25,905
Bags of kindness.

650
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,369
How'd y'all get together?

651
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:41,297
Not to get into a me thing,
but I did start the band...

652
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:46,424
<i>...sometime ago and I placed
an ad in a magazine called Peaches.</i>

653
00:57:46,642 --> 00:57:49,014
And Russell Hammond answered.

654
00:57:49,478 --> 00:57:50,509
<i>Peaches.</i>

655
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:54,145
It was a gift from God.
Nobody plays like Russell.

656
00:57:55,025 --> 00:57:57,695
Shit, man. Thank you.

657
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:03,900
You might wanna hit
that delay button, Quincy.

658
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:16,250
Quince?

659
00:58:20,258 --> 00:58:22,464
Now we're talking, right?

660
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:25,596
Right?

661
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:30,136
Why the fuck wait for an interview
to say something nice about me?

662
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:35,511
Why not say it to my fucking face? I
tell you every time you nail something.

663
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:37,890
Everybody pays you compliments.

664
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:43,863
It's not my fucking job
to kiss your fucking ass.

665
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:48,901
Whose fucking job is it?
Because my ass is dying for a kiss.

666
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,112
I know yours is too.

667
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:53,536
It's my fucking job.
I think you're all geniuses.

668
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:57,331
And to all the folks out there:
Smegma.

669
00:58:57,544 --> 00:58:58,575
Nice.

670
00:58:58,795 --> 00:58:59,993
Fellas.

671
00:59:00,422 --> 00:59:01,964
Feces.

672
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,376
The song is "Love Thing."

673
00:59:06,636 --> 00:59:09,209
Your mind is starting
to take effect.

674
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,302
They've come to watch you
swallow fire.

675
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:13,797
You scream...

676
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,892
...soundlessly...

677
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:18,601
...on the Night Circus.

678
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:26,068
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

679
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:30,940
<i>Pronto.</i>

680
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,280
<i>- May I speak with William?
- He's in the bar with the band.</i>

681
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:38,239
They're back from the radio station.
Is this Maryann with the pot?

682
00:59:41,086 --> 00:59:42,117
Hello?

683
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,592
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

684
00:59:47,843 --> 00:59:49,965
This is Elaine, his mother.

685
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,802
Could you give William
a message, please?

686
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,636
<i>Tell him to call home immediately.
And also tell him...</i>

687
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:02,807
...I know what's going on.

688
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:06,849
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

689
01:00:07,111 --> 01:00:09,400
You should be really proud of him.

690
01:00:09,655 --> 01:00:12,276
Because I know men,
and I'll bet you do too.

691
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:15,404
<i>He respects women,
and he likes women.</i>

692
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,739
<i>And let's just pause
and appreciate a man like that.</i>

693
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:22,118
You created him out of thin air.
You raised him right.

694
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:24,831
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.

695
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:29,749
<i>Don't worry, he's still a virgin,
and we're all looking out for him.</i>

696
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:33,424
You know? That's more than I've
ever said to my own parents.

697
01:00:34,804 --> 01:00:36,133
<i>So there you go.</i>

698
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,966
<i>This is a maid speaking,
by the way.</i>

699
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,436
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

700
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:55,032
Russell. So, what is it
you love about music?

701
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:58,776
Shut that thing off and I'll tell you
the truth, all right?

702
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,624
Look. Fuck, I trust you, so I'm
just gonna lay this right on you.

703
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:10,502
Just make us look cool.

704
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:17,335
I will quote you
warmly and accurately.

705
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:20,881
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

706
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:26,430
You see, some of us have girlfriends
back home, you know?

707
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,847
Some of us have wives.

708
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:33,981
And some of the people
that you meet on the road...

709
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,026
...are really amazing people.

710
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:44,568
Like you.

711
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:50,336
Some of the stuff that happens,
it's good for...

712
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:53,422
...a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

713
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,039
...a million people.

714
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:01,339
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

715
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:05,970
They say you're dangerous.

716
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:09,597
You see everything.
Most people...

717
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:12,019
...are just waiting to talk.

718
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:14,309
But you listen.

719
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:19,853
I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

720
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:23,195
I'm past them, as musicians, but...

721
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:26,743
...the more popular we get,
the bigger their houses get...

722
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:29,243
...the more responsibilities,
the pressure.

723
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:33,283
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

724
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:35,162
Then you forget.

725
01:02:35,379 --> 01:02:39,543
Forget what it's like
to be a fan.

726
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:43,505
It doesn't sound like music anymore.

727
01:02:43,721 --> 01:02:45,180
It sounds like...

728
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:49,343
...lifestyle maintenance,
or something.

729
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,895
"Lifestyle maintenance."
That's...

730
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:58,307
I used to be able to hear...

731
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:02,979
...the sounds of the world.

732
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,284
To me, it sounded like music.

733
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,196
Now, I don't hear it...

734
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:12,701
...anymore.

735
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:23,671
Do you understand what I'm saying?

736
01:03:23,927 --> 01:03:26,381
Yeah.

737
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:32,430
What am I doing?

738
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:38,189
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

739
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,640
No.

740
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,613
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

741
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,152
- Okay.
- Okay.

742
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,153
So tonight it's...

743
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,944
Well, friends.

744
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,738
- Yeah, right.
- We trust you.

745
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,791
Larry Fellows...

746
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,044
What is your role in Stillwater?

747
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:06,294
What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

748
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,303
I'm the bass player.

749
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,010
Right.

750
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,352
And when you take that away...

751
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,681
...what would be missing,
stylistically?

752
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,181
What chemical?

753
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,396
A bass?

754
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,522
Okay.

755
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:21,870
- What's going on?
- Russell got electrocuted!

756
01:05:25,752 --> 01:05:27,829
Okay, everybody be cool!

757
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:32,248
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

758
01:05:32,509 --> 01:05:35,759
Who's taking care of us?
What about the gear?

759
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:37,762
I'll deal with it. Get on the bus!

760
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,588
- Come on! Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

761
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:42,766
- You the manager?
- That and more.

762
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:44,810
You didn't finish your full set, man.

763
01:05:45,063 --> 01:05:48,728
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

764
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:52,151
You trashed my dressing room
and didn't do 25 minutes!

765
01:05:52,404 --> 01:05:55,155
- Don't fuck with my band's safety!
- Fuck you, man!

766
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:57,571
I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

767
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:01,240
- I'll call Frank Barcelona!
- You don't know him!

768
01:06:01,453 --> 01:06:03,197
You're all amateurs!

769
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:05,617
- Come on!
- You want it?

770
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:07,868
What do you got?

771
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,664
Watch the shirt, fuck!

772
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:15,088
I'm gonna kick your ass.

773
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:17,170
Take it easy, man.

774
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:19,425
I hope you got a lawyer.

775
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,300
Make a live album!
This is your last tour!

776
01:06:23,516 --> 01:06:27,099
What? What? What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

777
01:06:27,312 --> 01:06:28,936
Come on.

778
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:32,810
Take it easy.

779
01:06:33,568 --> 01:06:35,062
Lock the gates!

780
01:06:36,154 --> 01:06:39,403
Go through the fucking gate.

781
01:06:39,616 --> 01:06:41,691
Lock the gates on these fuckheads!

782
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:44,365
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

783
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,043
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

784
01:06:51,252 --> 01:06:53,578
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

785
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:57,295
And she says to tell you,
"I know what's going on."

786
01:06:57,507 --> 01:07:00,675
So I'll see you guys in Topeka, okay?

787
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:08,806
Amateurs! You don't know
who you're dealing with!

788
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:10,050
Lock the gates!

789
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:18,773
- You want to buy a gate?
- Yeah!

790
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:24,907
<i>You just bought a gate!</i>

791
01:07:46,722 --> 01:07:49,177
Hey. Give that to me, William.

792
01:07:53,686 --> 01:07:56,309
Give me that.

793
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:05,813
Russell, wake up.

794
01:08:06,825 --> 01:08:09,991
Wake up. It's a girls' running team.

795
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:12,572
Goddamn!

796
01:08:12,914 --> 01:08:15,287
Let it go, fellas. Let it go, buddy.

797
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,539
When are we getting to Topeka, man?

798
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:20,788
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

799
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,297
Look at all the tasty-looking
high school girls.

800
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:27,959
We can't stop the bus
for every girl in shorts.

801
01:08:28,178 --> 01:08:30,586
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

802
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,261
...we should wear
completely different clothes...

803
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,598
...and be completely different people.

804
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:38,102
What will our names be?

805
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:49,322
What do you think of Russell?

806
01:08:52,118 --> 01:08:53,494
I like him.

807
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:57,244
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

808
01:08:57,915 --> 01:09:01,581
Give them a break.
There are problems in the band.

809
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,537
- Off the record.
- What problems?

810
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,007
Okay, I got it.

811
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:12,837
Your name should be Spencer,
and mine will be Jane.

812
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:19,516
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.

813
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:26,394
You're coming to Cleveland, right?

814
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:31,189
Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no, no, no.

815
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:34,906
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

816
01:09:35,327 --> 01:09:40,285
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

817
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:41,827
He's my last project.

818
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:46,538
I only do this for a very few people,
and I think we should do it together.

819
01:09:46,755 --> 01:09:50,455
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

820
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:55,672
What's your real name?

821
01:10:01,394 --> 01:10:03,387
All right, let's go.

822
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:11,275
Oh, it's okay. I'm easy to forget.

823
01:10:11,486 --> 01:10:13,028
Just leave me behind!

824
01:10:13,238 --> 01:10:17,022
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

825
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:24,578
So, Ed Vallencourt,
what do you love about music?

826
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,552
<i>You said you'd tell me where you were.</i>

827
01:10:42,809 --> 01:10:44,967
<i>- And call twice a day.
- I know!</i>

828
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:48,766
<i>- You said you wouldn't miss any tests.
- I'll be home for graduation.</i>

829
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:50,642
<i>- Mom...
- Where are you?</i>

830
01:10:50,858 --> 01:10:53,776
Right now, Topeka,
then Greenville, then home.

831
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,857
<i>What about graduation?
We had an agreement.</i>

832
01:10:57,072 --> 01:10:59,398
I'm sorry I didn't call
you yesterday.

833
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:03,531
I miss you and I don't understand
why I've driven my kids so far away.

834
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:06,533
<i>By all rules, don't I
get you for another three years?</i>

835
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,909
Was I not fun?

836
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,534
<i>Yes.</i>

837
01:11:12,504 --> 01:11:14,330
This is Beth from Denver.

838
01:11:14,547 --> 01:11:17,419
She's one of the legendary
original Band Aids.

839
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:20,837
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

840
01:11:21,054 --> 01:11:23,924
<i>I mean, I pick up things
here and there.</i>

841
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:25,468
Estrella says hi.

842
01:11:25,683 --> 01:11:29,551
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

843
01:11:29,854 --> 01:11:32,012
<i>Great! I've got some...</i>

844
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,396
...hydroponic pot!

845
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:37,858
Wow, your aura is really fantastic!

846
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,107
<i>- It's this beautiful purple colour.
- I love you.</i>

847
01:11:41,324 --> 01:11:43,281
I missed the last thing you said.

848
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:45,900
<i>- Your aura is purple!
- I love you.</i>

849
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,492
<i>- What?
- Purple! It's purple!</i>

850
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:51,660
<i>- Mom, what?
- Your aura is purple!</i>

851
01:11:51,876 --> 01:11:54,283
I miss you and I love you!

852
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:56,460
I love you.

853
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:27,273
All right.

854
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:30,072
Fire away. I'm ready.

855
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:32,660
Do you have to be sad
to write a sad song...

856
01:12:32,873 --> 01:12:34,746
...and in love to write a love song?

857
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:38,126
Is a song better
if it really happened to you?

858
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:42,999
Like "Love Thing." Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

859
01:12:44,635 --> 01:12:46,543
When did you get so professional?

860
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:53,344
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

861
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:17,369
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

862
01:13:18,876 --> 01:13:22,126
T-shirts are gone... band happy.
All right?

863
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:28,510
Can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this?

864
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,750
Yeah, okay.

865
01:13:30,096 --> 01:13:32,336
I can see you want to get into it.

866
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:36,636
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

867
01:13:37,269 --> 01:13:38,597
Here.

868
01:13:39,897 --> 01:13:42,269
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

869
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:46,065
See, you love this T-shirt.

870
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:48,436
It lets you say
everything you want.

871
01:13:49,114 --> 01:13:51,272
Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

872
01:13:51,492 --> 01:13:54,160
It's a T-shirt.

873
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:57,451
Do you give a shit about a T-shirt?

874
01:13:57,664 --> 01:14:01,281
I'm just hungry. Let's just go
find some barbecue or something.

875
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,125
I'll always tell you the truth.

876
01:14:03,336 --> 01:14:04,878
You doing coke again?

877
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:07,456
Oh, yeah, all the time.

878
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,047
This is big stuff, man.

879
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:13,129
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

880
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:15,718
...and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

881
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:17,970
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

882
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,470
Page, Plant. Mick, Keith.

883
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,930
Blackmore, Gillan.

884
01:14:24,188 --> 01:14:26,348
But somehow it's all turning around.

885
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,057
We have got to control
what's happening!

886
01:14:29,444 --> 01:14:32,445
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

887
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:36,107
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

888
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:39,078
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

889
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:42,825
Trust him. Say what you want.

890
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:47,668
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

891
01:14:48,463 --> 01:14:51,380
You know what I do? I connect.

892
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:54,001
I get people off!

893
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,177
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

894
01:14:57,388 --> 01:14:59,714
...and I make him get off.

895
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:01,759
Actually, that you can print!

896
01:15:03,685 --> 01:15:07,683
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

897
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,474
You want to pretend this won't be
a very big band? Well, it is!

898
01:15:12,695 --> 01:15:14,900
You call yourself
a leader of this band...

899
01:15:15,447 --> 01:15:17,689
...but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...

900
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:22,617
...when you allowed Dick to manage us.
Because he's your friend!

901
01:15:22,829 --> 01:15:26,079
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

902
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:30,829
Is it my turn now? I think we should,
for once, say what we really mean.

903
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:34,710
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right, I'm so predictable.

904
01:15:34,924 --> 01:15:36,418
Deal with it.

905
01:15:36,634 --> 01:15:39,125
- I'll say what nobody else will say.
- What?!

906
01:15:39,346 --> 01:15:42,050
Your looks have become a problem!

907
01:15:42,598 --> 01:15:44,841
All right, okay, enough! Break it up.

908
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:47,680
Everyone out of the room
for five minutes.

909
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,222
Hey!

910
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:54,350
Yeah. William. Sorry.

911
01:15:56,613 --> 01:15:58,604
Come on, man. Come on.

912
01:15:58,822 --> 01:16:01,859
Let's go find something real.

913
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:11,167
From here on out, I'm only
interested in what is real.

914
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:13,084
Real people, real feelings.

915
01:16:13,295 --> 01:16:16,129
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

916
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:19,258
You're real.

917
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:22,587
- Thanks.
- You know...

918
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:26,132
...you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

919
01:16:28,809 --> 01:16:30,767
Tell me, what's your family like?

920
01:16:33,564 --> 01:16:35,521
My dad died of a heart attack.

921
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:38,271
My sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

922
01:16:38,485 --> 01:16:40,609
...that she had to escape our family.

923
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:43,526
They can't find a way
to get through it.

924
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,567
They don't even speak anymore.

925
01:16:45,784 --> 01:16:49,782
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess.

926
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:55,452
It's good to talk about.

927
01:16:56,669 --> 01:16:59,920
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

928
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:03,500
...to the one guy you're not supposed
to tell your secrets to.

929
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,471
You're Russell from Stillwater.

930
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:14,641
Well, yeah, on my better days
I am Russell from Stillwater.

931
01:17:14,853 --> 01:17:17,061
Want to go to my friend Aaron's party?

932
01:17:17,273 --> 01:17:19,099
I know you're
a big rock star and all...

933
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,650
...but want to hang with good people
and have a good time?

934
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:27,570
We're just real Topeka people, man.

935
01:17:49,513 --> 01:17:52,929
Oh, my God. Holy shit. Fuck!

936
01:17:53,433 --> 01:17:55,389
I grew up with that lampshade.

937
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:59,429
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

938
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:09,728
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

939
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:16,281
You, Aaron, are what it's all about.

940
01:18:17,164 --> 01:18:18,622
You're real.

941
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,744
Your room is real.

942
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:23,326
Your friends are real.

943
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:27,378
Real, man, real. You know? Real.

944
01:18:30,802 --> 01:18:32,594
Real, you know?

945
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:41,349
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

946
01:18:42,356 --> 01:18:44,348
Silly machinery. And you know it!

947
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:49,310
In 11 years, it's gonna be 1984, man.
Think about that.

948
01:18:50,613 --> 01:18:52,736
Want to see me feed
a mouse to my snake?

949
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,189
Yes.

950
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:56,650
Can I have that bitchin' belt?

951
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:58,535
Take it.

952
01:18:59,997 --> 01:19:03,829
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, brother.

953
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,171
We should probably get back
with the others.

954
01:19:13,427 --> 01:19:15,466
- Oh, it's over.
- Hey...

955
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:19,631
...there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

956
01:19:22,186 --> 01:19:23,597
That's mine.

957
01:19:25,772 --> 01:19:27,564
Topeka. Check it out.

958
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:32,103
Please, don't give him
any more acid. Thank you.

959
01:19:40,787 --> 01:19:42,826
Dick? Dick, I got him.

960
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:45,034
He's okay.

961
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,041
He is on acid, though.

962
01:19:47,585 --> 01:19:52,412
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?

963
01:19:52,924 --> 01:19:56,008
I am a golden god!

964
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:58,256
Yes, you are!

965
01:19:59,346 --> 01:20:02,265
I am a golden god!

966
01:20:02,475 --> 01:20:03,506
Hey, Russell.

967
01:20:04,268 --> 01:20:05,382
Don't jump.

968
01:20:07,061 --> 01:20:09,470
<i>And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...</i>

969
01:20:09,982 --> 01:20:12,686
...that my last words...

970
01:20:13,444 --> 01:20:14,475
...were:

971
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:20,563
"I'm on drugs."

972
01:20:30,752 --> 01:20:33,503
I think we should work
on those last words!

973
01:20:33,713 --> 01:20:35,920
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

974
01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:39,628
I got it. I got it. This is better.

975
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:41,879
Last words:

976
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,007
"I dig music."

977
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:49,769
"I'm on drugs!"

978
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:55,889
Just come on down...

979
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:58,779
...and we'll go back to the hotel.

980
01:20:59,197 --> 01:21:00,275
Okay.

981
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:01,900
- Jump.
- Jump!

982
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,208
Somebody help him.

983
01:21:19,423 --> 01:21:21,166
I'll save you, Russell!

984
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:31,844
<i>They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.</i>

985
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:33,341
<i>Oh, the band's over.</i>

986
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:36,274
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

987
01:21:36,482 --> 01:21:38,390
- Right.
- Definitely. It's over.

988
01:21:38,608 --> 01:21:41,894
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just go to Greenville.

989
01:21:42,112 --> 01:21:45,446
We'll listen to some great music,
we'll finish the tour...

990
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:48,528
...and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

991
01:21:48,785 --> 01:21:51,359
Then we'll come back here,
where you'll live.

992
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:54,415
- That sounds good.
- He can stay in our basement.

993
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:58,456
- I see what you're doing. I like it.
- Okay, good.

994
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:00,375
Come on.

995
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,710
I got it, man, I got it.

996
01:22:03,967 --> 01:22:06,006
That felt kind of good, though.

997
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:08,801
Excuse me, kids.

998
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:12,473
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

999
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:15,091
How do we know you're not a cop? Huh?

1000
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:18,561
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

1001
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:20,564
He's your guardian angel.

1002
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:24,060
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.

1003
01:22:24,277 --> 01:22:25,393
Which half?

1004
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:27,522
Just help me get my interview.

1005
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,313
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

1006
01:22:30,577 --> 01:22:32,367
- I have to go home.
- Look.

1007
01:22:32,578 --> 01:22:36,029
You saved the tour.
That's good enough for now, okay?

1008
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,666
- Come on, big fella, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

1009
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:44,373
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

1010
01:22:50,094 --> 01:22:53,629
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

1011
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:59,603
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves,
and we'll see you all again in 1974.

1012
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,478
Good evening!

1013
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,665
I have to go home.

1014
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:00,129
You are home.

1015
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:17,441
<i>In Carl Jung's opinion...</i>

1016
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,571
...we all have
a sixth sense, intuition.

1017
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:23,783
When you feel you can't live
without someone you just met...

1018
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:28,288
...this could be the memory of a past
love from the collective unconscious.

1019
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,039
Or it could just be hormones.

1020
01:25:34,837 --> 01:25:37,043
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

1021
01:25:38,173 --> 01:25:41,258
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

1022
01:25:49,434 --> 01:25:52,684
<i>Most of the fuckups in the world...</i>

1023
01:25:52,938 --> 01:25:56,023
<i>... come from the brain,
not the instincts.</i>

1024
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:59,015
My whole thing is to try and...

1025
01:25:59,277 --> 01:26:02,113
My thing is to make
my brain go away.

1026
01:26:02,364 --> 01:26:05,068
But I can't, except on stage.

1027
01:26:05,367 --> 01:26:09,495
The brain should be a softening
influence on the instincts...

1028
01:26:09,704 --> 01:26:12,704
...but the instincts should drive.

1029
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:17,784
Trying to reconcile the brain
with ancient urges.

1030
01:26:18,045 --> 01:26:21,082
The way the brain interprets
these instincts...

1031
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,799
...is a heavy trip.

1032
01:26:23,008 --> 01:26:26,460
Vallencourt, are you getting
on the bus or what?

1033
01:26:28,472 --> 01:26:31,675
Come on, let's get on the bus.

1034
01:26:36,855 --> 01:26:38,848
<i>U sually I'm brain...</i>

1035
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:41,896
<i>... and Russell is instinct.</i>

1036
01:26:43,988 --> 01:26:46,692
<i>But when we're both instinct...</i>

1037
01:26:46,948 --> 01:26:50,815
<i>... that's when we make
the most memorable music...</i>

1038
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:52,820
<i>... because it's the best.</i>

1039
01:26:57,583 --> 01:27:01,284
Show me any guy who said
he didn't want popularity...

1040
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:06,331
...and I'll show you a scared guy.
I've studied the history of music.

1041
01:27:06,551 --> 01:27:10,051
Most of the time, the best stuff
is the popular stuff.

1042
01:27:10,638 --> 01:27:13,592
It's safe to say popularity sucks.

1043
01:27:13,849 --> 01:27:17,634
It allows you to forgive yourself
if you suck.

1044
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:21,520
And I don't forgive myself.
Do you?

1045
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:26,481
<i>Lester, Rolling Stone
is calling me.</i>

1046
01:27:26,695 --> 01:27:28,439
I don't have my key interview.

1047
01:27:30,115 --> 01:27:32,357
- Days are going by.
- You're flipping.

1048
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:34,901
That's good. All right.

1049
01:27:35,788 --> 01:27:38,623
This is how you blow their minds.
He'll ask you...

1050
01:27:38,832 --> 01:27:41,323
<i>- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah.</i>

1051
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:45,125
He'll ask you how the story's going,
and this is what you do.

1052
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:46,796
Tell him...

1053
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:50,967
...you know, it's a...
It's a "think piece"...

1054
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:53,670
Think piece.

1055
01:27:54,305 --> 01:27:56,713
<i>... about a mid-level band...</i>

1056
01:27:56,933 --> 01:28:00,847
...struggling with their own
limitations in the, you know...

1057
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:02,342
...harsh face of stardom.

1058
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:04,888
Harsh face.

1059
01:28:05,107 --> 01:28:07,230
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

1060
01:28:12,614 --> 01:28:15,569
All dressed up and no place to go.

1061
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:16,982
Greenville.

1062
01:28:17,202 --> 01:28:18,863
I'm bored.

1063
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,830
Who hid the Quaaludes from me?

1064
01:28:28,796 --> 01:28:30,078
I have to pee.

1065
01:28:31,008 --> 01:28:33,249
Wow! Cute.

1066
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:37,634
Let's deflower the kid.

1067
01:28:46,063 --> 01:28:48,898
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

1068
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:51,184
Wait. I should leave.

1069
01:28:51,401 --> 01:28:53,940
I think things are going
backwards for me.

1070
01:28:54,155 --> 01:28:56,728
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just...

1071
01:28:56,991 --> 01:29:01,451
I thought maybe we could hang out.
You know, do some stuff back home...

1072
01:29:01,662 --> 01:29:03,286
...like regular stuff.

1073
01:29:03,496 --> 01:29:07,494
Get to know each other a little
bit better, and then I'd see you pee.

1074
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:11,292
I mean, you know, that's just
the way I usually do it.

1075
01:29:11,505 --> 01:29:13,414
You're one of us.

1076
01:29:13,798 --> 01:29:15,257
If you come to Cleveland...

1077
01:29:15,508 --> 01:29:18,082
...Bowie will be at Swingo's,
America's greatest hotel.

1078
01:29:18,303 --> 01:29:22,170
I'll introduce you to him,
and his security guard, Dennis.

1079
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,011
Don't you have any regular friends?

1080
01:29:25,518 --> 01:29:28,188
Famous people are
just more interesting.

1081
01:29:29,272 --> 01:29:32,272
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

1082
01:29:34,152 --> 01:29:36,642
Boy, if this was the real world...

1083
01:29:36,862 --> 01:29:38,820
Not that anybody's using you!

1084
01:29:39,032 --> 01:29:40,490
No. Hold on.

1085
01:29:43,243 --> 01:29:45,866
I'm not famous. But...

1086
01:29:46,997 --> 01:29:49,748
- Your time has come.
- Did Russell call?

1087
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:52,035
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

1088
01:29:53,879 --> 01:29:56,714
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

1089
01:29:56,923 --> 01:29:58,548
Opie must die.

1090
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:03,251
- No. Okay, this isn't funny.
- No, come on!

1091
01:30:05,932 --> 01:30:07,427
- Up!
- Please.

1092
01:30:08,394 --> 01:30:10,681
Guys, come on. I have to write.

1093
01:30:36,963 --> 01:30:39,287
Come on, Penny, join us.

1094
01:30:57,857 --> 01:31:01,440
<i>Take a vacation from yourself.
Leave this up to professionals.</i>

1095
01:31:01,652 --> 01:31:03,063
<i>Don't worry, William.</i>

1096
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:07,822
<i>I've seen the future, and this
all works out reasonably well.</i>

1097
01:31:08,409 --> 01:31:10,034
<i>Reasonably?</i>

1098
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,833
Hello?

1099
01:31:18,752 --> 01:31:22,667
<i>Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres
calling from Rolling Stone.</i>

1100
01:31:22,923 --> 01:31:25,331
<i>Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from Rolling Stone.</i>

1101
01:31:25,592 --> 01:31:27,965
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

1102
01:31:30,013 --> 01:31:31,045
Hello, Ben.

1103
01:31:31,265 --> 01:31:36,342
<i>William Miller, this is your editor
at Rolling Stone. How's the story?</i>

1104
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,978
I'm getting good stuff out here.

1105
01:31:39,189 --> 01:31:41,146
Yeah, it sounds like it.

1106
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:43,603
Man, I need some...

1107
01:31:47,447 --> 01:31:50,484
Now, listen. Get it together, man.

1108
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,618
We're professionals.
I don't need to tell you this.

1109
01:31:53,828 --> 01:31:57,197
<i>You're not there to party.
We already have Hunter Thompson.</i>

1110
01:31:57,415 --> 01:32:00,036
<i>You're out there
to interview and to report.</i>

1111
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,956
<i>Now, this isn't Creem.
This is Rolling Stone.</i>

1112
01:32:03,171 --> 01:32:06,421
This story is due in four days.
How is it shaping up?

1113
01:32:11,386 --> 01:32:14,008
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

1114
01:32:14,223 --> 01:32:18,302
...struggling with their limitations
in the harsh face of stardom.

1115
01:32:18,728 --> 01:32:19,759
That's great.

1116
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:26,727
I like what we're saying. Let me try
and get you 1000 more words.

1117
01:32:26,943 --> 01:32:29,434
<i>Now, it's in consideration
for the cover...</i>

1118
01:32:29,653 --> 01:32:32,062
<i>... but don't tell the band.</i>

1119
01:32:33,116 --> 01:32:35,025
<i>The cover.</i>

1120
01:32:35,284 --> 01:32:36,827
<i>Crazy.</i>

1121
01:32:37,037 --> 01:32:38,531
Crazy.

1122
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:40,818
Some coffee.

1123
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,499
Me too.

1124
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:45,076
Greenville is so boring.

1125
01:32:45,295 --> 01:32:49,873
You know, any other city in the world,
and you'd still be a virgin.

1126
01:32:50,508 --> 01:32:53,379
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

1127
01:32:53,594 --> 01:32:57,461
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

1128
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:01,097
- Don't worry, baby, you will.
- I gotta find Russell.

1129
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:04,726
- I gotta find Russell.
- Oh, will you take the laundry?

1130
01:33:06,357 --> 01:33:07,554
Take the laundry?

1131
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,605
What am I to you? Huh? Tell me.

1132
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:13,404
Tell me right now.

1133
01:33:13,613 --> 01:33:16,485
What am I to you?

1134
01:33:26,751 --> 01:33:28,625
Excuse me, sir,
will you sign for this?

1135
01:33:28,878 --> 01:33:31,203
Good morning.

1136
01:33:45,477 --> 01:33:47,554
Please go the fuck away!

1137
01:34:42,658 --> 01:34:45,694
We'll do the interview in Cleveland.

1138
01:34:46,536 --> 01:34:49,491
No, I can't go to Cleveland.

1139
01:34:49,748 --> 01:34:53,200
Come on, man, we'll have
more time there.

1140
01:34:53,585 --> 01:34:54,830
Don't be tense.

1141
01:34:57,588 --> 01:34:58,965
Come to Cleveland.

1142
01:34:59,216 --> 01:35:00,924
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

1143
01:35:01,176 --> 01:35:05,921
- Come to Cleveland.
- I can't go to Cleveland.

1144
01:35:06,181 --> 01:35:08,932
Can we help it if we like
having you around?

1145
01:35:09,184 --> 01:35:11,390
Come to Cleveland.

1146
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:15,725
I don't want to go to Cleveland, okay?

1147
01:35:16,023 --> 01:35:19,060
I want to go home.

1148
01:35:20,611 --> 01:35:22,936
I like it when you yell.

1149
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:28,031
I'm not gonna let you miss out
on the rock mecca of the Midwest.

1150
01:35:28,286 --> 01:35:29,744
You're with us.

1151
01:35:30,245 --> 01:35:34,954
- Rock'n'roll.
- Rock'n'roll.

1152
01:35:36,418 --> 01:35:40,463
I know, I know.
"It's all happening."

1153
01:35:54,810 --> 01:35:56,804
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

1154
01:35:58,981 --> 01:36:00,807
- It's Stillwater!
- Oh, my God!

1155
01:36:01,025 --> 01:36:03,777
Hi, welcome to Swingo's.
You must be Stillwater.

1156
01:36:03,986 --> 01:36:08,280
"Memory of a Free Festival,"
that's vintage Bowie.

1157
01:36:08,532 --> 01:36:13,954
<i>Ziggy Stardust is mass media.
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.</i>

1158
01:36:16,874 --> 01:36:18,249
It's Bowie!

1159
01:36:52,618 --> 01:36:56,032
Jeff and Russell are
the band's figureheads...

1160
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:59,448
...but the true Stillwater fan...

1161
01:36:59,707 --> 01:37:05,128
...knows that the purity, the core of
Stillwater, comes from Ed Vallencourt.

1162
01:37:05,713 --> 01:37:09,164
Hi, Mom. I'm gonna
fly back Monday morning.

1163
01:37:10,509 --> 01:37:13,924
No, I'll only miss one test.
I'll make graduation.

1164
01:37:14,137 --> 01:37:16,843
<i>Tell her you're a slave
to the groove.</i>

1165
01:37:22,897 --> 01:37:26,395
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

1166
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:31,150
How does it feel to be the mother
of the best rock journalist we've met?

1167
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:34,693
<i>Hello?</i>

1168
01:37:37,827 --> 01:37:40,365
You got a great kid here.
Don't worry.

1169
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:44,322
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show...

1170
01:37:44,584 --> 01:37:46,872
<i>...and join the circus.
- Listen, mister.</i>

1171
01:37:47,503 --> 01:37:50,041
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

1172
01:37:50,256 --> 01:37:52,130
Oh, of course you like him.

1173
01:37:52,883 --> 01:37:54,294
Well, yeah.

1174
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:59,217
He worships you people. That's fine
as long as he helps make you rich.

1175
01:37:59,806 --> 01:38:03,507
<i>- Rich? I don't think so. We sit...
- Listen to me.</i>

1176
01:38:03,727 --> 01:38:06,812
He's a smart, goodhearted
15-year-old kid...

1177
01:38:07,023 --> 01:38:08,397
<i>... with infinite potential.</i>

1178
01:38:09,983 --> 01:38:12,557
<i>You're not talking
to some apron-wearing mom.</i>

1179
01:38:12,777 --> 01:38:15,814
<i>I know about your decadence.
I shouldn't have let him go.</i>

1180
01:38:16,364 --> 01:38:21,275
He's not ready for your world of
compromise and diminished brain cells.

1181
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:22,657
Am I clear?

1182
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:25,321
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- lf you break his spirit...</i>

1183
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,117
<i>... harm him in any way...</i>

1184
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,165
...keep him from his chosen profession,
which is law, something I value...

1185
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:34,122
<i>... you'll meet this voice in person...</i>

1186
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:37,875
...and it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

1187
01:38:38,594 --> 01:38:40,919
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- I didn't ask for this role...</i>

1188
01:38:41,138 --> 01:38:42,680
...but I'll play it.

1189
01:38:44,516 --> 01:38:46,389
Now go do your best.

1190
01:38:46,853 --> 01:38:49,805
"Be bold, and mighty forces
will come to your aid."

1191
01:38:50,022 --> 01:38:51,646
Goethe said that.

1192
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:57,149
It's not too late for you
to become a person of substance.

1193
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:00,406
<i>Please get my son home safely.</i>

1194
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:03,529
<i>You know, I'm glad we spoke.</i>

1195
01:39:23,345 --> 01:39:25,255
- All right, boys.
- All right.

1196
01:39:29,434 --> 01:39:31,925
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

1197
01:39:33,564 --> 01:39:35,272
She means well.

1198
01:39:39,112 --> 01:39:42,776
<i>From Troy, Michigan...</i>

1199
01:39:43,448 --> 01:39:47,362
<i>... would you please
welcome to Cleveland...</i>

1200
01:39:48,495 --> 01:39:50,618
...Stillwater!

1201
01:41:23,879 --> 01:41:26,834
When you play a great show
like tonight...

1202
01:41:27,049 --> 01:41:29,337
I need everyone's attention, please.

1203
01:41:29,551 --> 01:41:32,587
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

1204
01:41:32,847 --> 01:41:36,760
Right. Well, it seems
the rumours are true.

1205
01:41:37,683 --> 01:41:40,602
The record company's sent
a big-time manager here...

1206
01:41:40,812 --> 01:41:43,481
...to try and talk you
into replacing me.

1207
01:41:43,689 --> 01:41:46,097
It's Dennis Hope.
You've all heard of him.

1208
01:41:46,317 --> 01:41:49,900
He has all the big bands,
and he wants five minutes with you.

1209
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,396
Well, I think we've gotta do this.

1210
01:41:55,785 --> 01:41:57,196
- Send him in.
- Bring him in.

1211
01:41:57,411 --> 01:42:00,614
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

1212
01:42:00,872 --> 01:42:05,036
We'll do the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from there.

1213
01:42:09,506 --> 01:42:12,210
We got a manager
who's been with us all along.

1214
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:14,549
Respectfully. We all have our roots.

1215
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,837
Bands should hold on to their roots.

1216
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:19,850
Those roots need to be augmented.

1217
01:42:20,058 --> 01:42:23,012
I'll tell you the truth.
I may enrage some...

1218
01:42:23,854 --> 01:42:27,388
...and enthral others.
I don't give a fuck.

1219
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:30,774
Your manager here
needs a manager.

1220
01:42:30,985 --> 01:42:34,105
Example: If you hadn't
run out in Phoenix...

1221
01:42:34,322 --> 01:42:36,695
...we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

1222
01:42:36,908 --> 01:42:40,442
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

1223
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:45,370
You travelled a long way to pay
that promoter to electrocute you.

1224
01:42:45,582 --> 01:42:47,955
Your damages have put you in the hole.

1225
01:42:48,169 --> 01:42:50,790
You owe the record company
more than you got.

1226
01:42:51,087 --> 01:42:53,046
But there's money to be made.

1227
01:42:53,257 --> 01:42:56,507
I brought a plane.
More shows to make up the difference.

1228
01:42:56,718 --> 01:42:59,257
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

1229
01:42:59,513 --> 01:43:02,134
Doris is the soul of this band.

1230
01:43:02,348 --> 01:43:05,883
That bus has been our home
since we were the Jeff Bebe band.

1231
01:43:06,103 --> 01:43:09,186
I'd travel on a pogo stick
to make more money.

1232
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:10,975
You could play more dates.

1233
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:15,022
It's not about money. It's about
the music and turning people on.

1234
01:43:15,236 --> 01:43:16,612
Clearly. Respectfully.

1235
01:43:16,821 --> 01:43:19,490
But on the distasteful
subject of money...

1236
01:43:19,698 --> 01:43:23,910
...just know that you're all
making it, right now...

1237
01:43:24,328 --> 01:43:26,202
...and it's all out there.

1238
01:43:26,455 --> 01:43:30,074
I'm just talking about
bringing it back here.

1239
01:43:31,127 --> 01:43:33,832
Why pay for something we can do?

1240
01:43:34,046 --> 01:43:38,293
You know how not to get charged
for the ice below Chicago Stadium?

1241
01:43:39,218 --> 01:43:40,961
You know how to do a headlining tour?

1242
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:46,426
Do you know Claire Rothman in L.A?
Know Bobby Cowan, Danny Marcus...

1243
01:43:46,642 --> 01:43:48,515
...Lisa Robinson?

1244
01:43:48,768 --> 01:43:50,595
Know Frank Barcelona?

1245
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:54,598
This is Cleveland!
Where's Kid Leo? Where is he?

1246
01:43:54,816 --> 01:43:57,901
You know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

1247
01:43:58,153 --> 01:44:02,613
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

1248
01:44:02,825 --> 01:44:06,656
You may believe this will
last forever. It does not.

1249
01:44:06,911 --> 01:44:10,695
Your biggest fan right now...
Your biggest fan...

1250
01:44:10,915 --> 01:44:16,336
...is gonna go to college, buy
clothes, spend that money elsewhere.

1251
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:22,422
And you know what? They'll tape
your record from a friend.

1252
01:44:22,718 --> 01:44:26,419
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can...

1253
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,423
...and you gotta do it now.

1254
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,218
That's what the big boys do.

1255
01:44:30,435 --> 01:44:32,592
If you think Mick Jagger'll
still be there...

1256
01:44:32,853 --> 01:44:37,265
...trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly mistaken.

1257
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,022
Well, thank you, Dennis.

1258
01:44:41,278 --> 01:44:45,322
- We'll think about what you said.
- Oh, no...

1259
01:44:46,324 --> 01:44:50,322
...l'll think about it.
I'm not auditioning.

1260
01:44:50,537 --> 01:44:54,368
I came here to decide
if I want to represent you.

1261
01:44:54,583 --> 01:45:00,003
So I'll stand outside and think
about whether I wanna stay.

1262
01:45:01,673 --> 01:45:03,416
It was a good show.

1263
01:45:15,186 --> 01:45:17,641
I miss him already.

1264
01:45:18,689 --> 01:45:22,687
<i>You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.</i>

1265
01:45:22,901 --> 01:45:25,059
<i>The war is over. They won.</i>

1266
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,277
<i>They will ruin rock'n'roll...</i>

1267
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:31,189
<i>... and strangle everything
we love about it.</i>

1268
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,237
- Put them up.
- I don't know what that was.

1269
01:46:54,449 --> 01:46:56,736
Donkey dick, man!

1270
01:46:56,992 --> 01:46:59,946
A donkey dick is funny everywhere.

1271
01:47:02,289 --> 01:47:03,617
Is Russell here?

1272
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:06,993
Hey, the Enemy! Come on in, son.

1273
01:47:09,505 --> 01:47:12,042
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1274
01:47:12,298 --> 01:47:16,166
This game's been going on for
two years. Come on, find a spot.

1275
01:47:16,887 --> 01:47:18,962
- Mick's with The Who.
- How you doing?

1276
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:22,514
Raymond's with the Eagles.
Reg is with Humble Pie.

1277
01:47:22,725 --> 01:47:24,932
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

1278
01:47:25,144 --> 01:47:27,636
We developed this system
of poker over time...

1279
01:47:27,855 --> 01:47:30,726
...to play in any condition,
which helps.

1280
01:47:30,983 --> 01:47:33,735
We let Russell in because
he brought hash.

1281
01:47:33,944 --> 01:47:37,776
- The press is here.
- Don't mention me, or The Eagles.

1282
01:47:38,866 --> 01:47:41,155
- I'm done.
- I'm out.

1283
01:47:42,411 --> 01:47:44,285
- I'm in.
- All right.

1284
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:49,704
Side proposition to the winner:
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

1285
01:47:49,919 --> 01:47:51,827
...l'll throw in three ladies...

1286
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:54,957
...including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

1287
01:47:55,174 --> 01:47:58,921
...who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1288
01:48:00,011 --> 01:48:02,633
- Okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft.

1289
01:48:04,807 --> 01:48:07,559
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

1290
01:48:07,811 --> 01:48:09,186
It's a deal.

1291
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:10,854
Show them.

1292
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:14,518
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

1293
01:48:14,818 --> 01:48:19,065
- Be good to them, Reg.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.

1294
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,394
All right.

1295
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:23,867
- Joint?
- Know how I know this is good stuff?

1296
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:25,357
- How?
- It's from Crosby.

1297
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:28,033
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- It's from Crosby.

1298
01:48:28,246 --> 01:48:31,284
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1299
01:48:33,335 --> 01:48:35,079
Give me a light. I want fire.

1300
01:48:35,296 --> 01:48:38,664
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1301
01:48:38,882 --> 01:48:42,962
She knows Leslie's coming to New York
tomorrow. Everyone understands.

1302
01:48:43,345 --> 01:48:46,298
It's the circus.
Everyone's trying not to go home.

1303
01:48:46,724 --> 01:48:48,799
Nobody's saying goodbye.

1304
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:54,561
Quit looking at me like that.

1305
01:49:31,558 --> 01:49:33,302
I'm making a wish.

1306
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:43,730
So...

1307
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:47,691
<i>Penny, our friend
Has gained another year</i>

1308
01:49:47,949 --> 01:49:50,619
<i>But long ago she threw it in gear</i>

1309
01:49:50,868 --> 01:49:55,496
<i>She rocked the south
The east, the west</i>

1310
01:49:56,207 --> 01:49:57,914
<i>Could we get off this tour</i>

1311
01:49:58,167 --> 01:50:00,740
<i>As Black Sabbath's special guests</i>

1312
01:50:03,005 --> 01:50:07,584
<i>She says she's retired
But we've heard that before</i>

1313
01:50:07,802 --> 01:50:12,547
<i>She chose us
In Penny Lane we trust</i>

1314
01:50:12,807 --> 01:50:16,258
<i>She is a fan of this band</i>

1315
01:50:17,394 --> 01:50:19,601
<i>Much more so than us</i>

1316
01:50:47,424 --> 01:50:49,215
Thank you, baby.

1317
01:50:55,681 --> 01:50:58,089
Who wants the "P" in Penny?

1318
01:50:58,476 --> 01:51:00,764
Happy birthday.

1319
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:04,021
- Thank you.
- Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

1320
01:51:06,691 --> 01:51:08,565
I'll take a piece.

1321
01:51:35,386 --> 01:51:37,592
Who didn't get cake?

1322
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:50,098
Any extra plates?

1323
01:51:51,277 --> 01:51:52,556
Anybody?

1324
01:51:55,197 --> 01:51:57,237
<i>You think you can fool me.</i>

1325
01:51:57,616 --> 01:52:00,701
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

1326
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:05,741
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

1327
01:52:08,752 --> 01:52:11,159
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1328
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:13,463
You're so sweet.

1329
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:17,839
God, if there was more of you in him.

1330
01:52:18,053 --> 01:52:21,836
Don't tell me this stuff.
I want to like him.

1331
01:52:24,976 --> 01:52:27,015
Did you miss a test or something?

1332
01:52:28,437 --> 01:52:32,435
- You have no idea.
- I know I'm not on the plane.

1333
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:34,357
I won't go with another band.

1334
01:52:34,568 --> 01:52:37,403
I could go with the crew,
but that'd be pathetic...

1335
01:52:37,613 --> 01:52:40,151
...and the girls are all
going with Humble Pie.

1336
01:52:40,574 --> 01:52:44,108
So if you could find out
from Russell...

1337
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:47,989
Forget it, I'll fly myself.
I have lots of partial tickets.

1338
01:52:48,207 --> 01:52:51,076
I know his ex-wife-
current-girlfriend thing will be...

1339
01:52:51,293 --> 01:52:52,917
That's not a good idea.

1340
01:52:53,129 --> 01:52:56,746
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?

1341
01:52:58,259 --> 01:53:01,342
- I don't know anything.
- I know he wants me there.

1342
01:53:01,803 --> 01:53:03,630
Wake up!

1343
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:05,341
Don't go to New York.

1344
01:53:06,266 --> 01:53:09,470
- Why are you yelling?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1345
01:53:09,686 --> 01:53:12,686
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1346
01:53:12,897 --> 01:53:15,222
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1347
01:53:15,567 --> 01:53:17,891
I don't even know your real name.

1348
01:53:18,652 --> 01:53:22,354
If I met a man in the real world
who looked at me the way you...

1349
01:53:22,573 --> 01:53:26,321
When and where
does this "real world" occur?

1350
01:53:26,535 --> 01:53:30,532
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

1351
01:53:30,747 --> 01:53:32,871
...and all these sayings
and nicknames.

1352
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:37,211
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock'n'roll.

1353
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,295
Sweet?

1354
01:53:39,965 --> 01:53:41,756
Where do you get off?

1355
01:53:41,966 --> 01:53:43,545
Where do you get "sweet"?

1356
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,333
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!

1357
01:53:46,555 --> 01:53:49,225
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

1358
01:53:49,433 --> 01:53:51,425
I am not sweet.

1359
01:53:51,643 --> 01:53:55,771
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

1360
01:53:55,981 --> 01:53:57,854
You should be happy for me.

1361
01:53:58,066 --> 01:54:00,735
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

1362
01:54:00,944 --> 01:54:04,063
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody...

1363
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:07,898
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

1364
01:54:08,952 --> 01:54:10,575
I was there.

1365
01:54:11,369 --> 01:54:13,280
I was there!

1366
01:54:20,045 --> 01:54:21,208
Oh, God.

1367
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,383
I'm sorry.

1368
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:43,522
What kind of beer?

1369
01:55:00,751 --> 01:55:03,076
<i>Welcome to New York!
You can be nervous.</i>

1370
01:55:03,337 --> 01:55:08,462
You should be. Just be yourself and
leave a pint of blood on the stage.

1371
01:55:08,675 --> 01:55:09,874
Hey, William.

1372
01:55:10,094 --> 01:55:13,260
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.

1373
01:55:26,527 --> 01:55:27,937
No. Yeah?

1374
01:55:47,296 --> 01:55:50,961
I'm from the Church of Lenny.
We bow to his will.

1375
01:55:51,216 --> 01:55:53,707
He is the king of kings.

1376
01:55:53,968 --> 01:55:56,923
- Can I get an autograph?
- Made out to who?

1377
01:55:57,139 --> 01:55:59,095
- She's here.
- To Lenny.

1378
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,726
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.

1379
01:56:06,857 --> 01:56:07,889
Leslie!

1380
01:56:11,152 --> 01:56:13,726
Room's fully stocked.
Air conditioning's on.

1381
01:56:13,989 --> 01:56:16,313
- You look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.

1382
01:56:16,574 --> 01:56:18,532
All right, bags in five!

1383
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:21,116
Cars leave for the party at 6.

1384
01:56:21,579 --> 01:56:23,286
Oh, God.

1385
01:56:27,334 --> 01:56:30,420
There are lighter souvenirs,
you know.

1386
01:56:30,672 --> 01:56:34,586
I kept thinking I was gonna
go home the next day.

1387
01:56:34,842 --> 01:56:37,380
So did I, 15 years ago.

1388
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:40,585
That's the wrong bag, you idiot!

1389
01:56:40,807 --> 01:56:42,051
William?

1390
01:56:42,392 --> 01:56:43,422
Vic!

1391
01:56:43,642 --> 01:56:46,679
It's all happening.
They're here.

1392
01:56:46,896 --> 01:56:50,679
Zeppelin are here. They are here.
They're at the Plaza.

1393
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:55,603
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

1394
01:56:55,862 --> 01:56:59,480
They're all staying under the name
"Emily Rugburn."

1395
01:56:59,991 --> 01:57:03,076
- Wait. Penny Lane is here?
- Emily Rugburn.

1396
01:57:03,745 --> 01:57:04,777
William Miller?

1397
01:57:05,247 --> 01:57:07,203
Sir, you have an urgent call.

1398
01:57:09,334 --> 01:57:10,365
Hello?

1399
01:57:10,585 --> 01:57:13,420
<i>This is Jann Wenner,
publisher of Rolling Stone.</i>

1400
01:57:13,671 --> 01:57:15,415
Congratulations, it's a cover.

1401
01:57:16,257 --> 01:57:18,131
<i>Leibovitz will shoot them in L.A...</i>

1402
01:57:18,384 --> 01:57:20,293
...but we need you
in San Francisco...

1403
01:57:20,554 --> 01:57:24,052
<i>... tomorrow. You can finish
the story here. Talk to Ben.</i>

1404
01:57:24,724 --> 01:57:28,009
You can tell the band. Alison, our
fact-checker, needs you...

1405
01:57:28,269 --> 01:57:31,434
<i>... to transmit whatever you have
of the story tonight.</i>

1406
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:34,103
<i>There's a mojo at the Daily News
you can use.</i>

1407
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:35,472
A mojo?

1408
01:57:35,734 --> 01:57:40,479
A mojo. It's a modern machine that
transmits pages over the telephone.

1409
01:57:40,739 --> 01:57:43,276
It only takes 18 minutes a page.

1410
01:57:44,743 --> 01:57:47,530
As soon as people leave,
I'll fit you in.

1411
01:57:47,745 --> 01:57:50,866
- Excuse me. Got an I. D?
- No.

1412
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:53,166
Hey, man, he's cool.

1413
01:57:53,376 --> 01:57:56,211
- Dennis, how's it going?
- Great.

1414
01:57:56,462 --> 01:57:58,122
Well, enjoy.

1415
01:58:14,313 --> 01:58:15,890
Opie.

1416
01:58:16,315 --> 01:58:19,934
I'm going to England with Deep Purple
in an hour.

1417
01:58:22,779 --> 01:58:24,855
Don't forget me, okay?

1418
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:31,069
It's all happening.
I must vamoosh.

1419
01:58:51,432 --> 01:58:52,891
Hey, the Enemy.

1420
01:58:53,142 --> 01:58:57,388
We got a table back there.
They're all looking for you.

1421
01:59:01,442 --> 01:59:02,473
Guys.

1422
01:59:04,278 --> 01:59:05,820
Guys!

1423
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:11,861
<i>You're gonna be on the cover
of Rolling Stone.</i>

1424
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,573
Are you serious?

1425
01:59:17,082 --> 01:59:19,786
<i>The cover of Rolling Stone.</i>

1426
01:59:20,794 --> 01:59:22,537
And we made it together.

1427
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,373
And they don't just put somebody...

1428
01:59:26,633 --> 01:59:30,583
<i>...with one little hit on
the cover of Rolling Stone...</i>

1429
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:33,592
...fucking magazine, man!

1430
01:59:33,848 --> 01:59:36,090
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1431
01:59:36,308 --> 01:59:38,765
When I first bought the magazine...

1432
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:41,427
...The Beatles were on the cover.

1433
01:59:41,689 --> 01:59:42,720
The Beatles.

1434
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:46,144
Four of them, four of us.

1435
02:00:16,389 --> 02:00:17,635
Thank you!

1436
02:00:20,727 --> 02:00:22,186
Who is that girl?

1437
02:00:22,437 --> 02:00:24,346
She's creeping me out.

1438
02:00:24,689 --> 02:00:26,266
She's not with any of you, is she?

1439
02:00:26,525 --> 02:00:28,268
Yeah, she's with me.

1440
02:00:38,869 --> 02:00:41,076
So, who's gonna shoot it?

1441
02:00:42,706 --> 02:00:44,616
I want Annie Leibovitz.

1442
02:00:44,875 --> 02:00:47,117
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

1443
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:31,720
I am no good at goodbyes.

1444
02:02:33,063 --> 02:02:34,094
And you...

1445
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,980
...are the last...

1446
02:02:37,234 --> 02:02:41,528
...of my old-time friends.

1447
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:45,066
Polexia...

1448
02:02:45,282 --> 02:02:48,818
Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

1449
02:02:49,287 --> 02:02:51,327
Can you believe that?

1450
02:02:51,622 --> 02:02:54,493
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1451
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:57,835
All she left was her Quaaludes.

1452
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,505
Oh, wonderful.

1453
02:03:02,174 --> 02:03:03,669
Where's Beth?

1454
02:03:03,885 --> 02:03:08,261
Where's my friends?
Where are all my friends?

1455
02:03:08,513 --> 02:03:12,179
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

1456
02:03:12,893 --> 02:03:14,351
Room 537.

1457
02:03:14,603 --> 02:03:16,181
Penny, get up!

1458
02:03:16,772 --> 02:03:17,803
I'm up.

1459
02:03:18,523 --> 02:03:22,224
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

1460
02:03:22,486 --> 02:03:26,187
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

1461
02:03:26,741 --> 02:03:29,195
Penny, get up. Get up.

1462
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:32,867
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.

1463
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:39,782
I've always been.
I'm retired, and I'm tired.

1464
02:03:40,044 --> 02:03:43,912
- Jane Abbott.
- Miss Jane Abbott.

1465
02:03:50,013 --> 02:03:52,218
Miss Judy Stanton.

1466
02:03:57,061 --> 02:04:00,975
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

1467
02:04:02,275 --> 02:04:03,519
<i>Seats and tray tables.</i>

1468
02:04:03,776 --> 02:04:07,359
Seat back and tables locked.

1469
02:04:07,613 --> 02:04:08,988
<i>And our pending graduate...</i>

1470
02:04:09,823 --> 02:04:12,943
...William Miller, not present.

1471
02:04:21,418 --> 02:04:23,292
Why doesn't he love me?

1472
02:04:33,221 --> 02:04:36,008
<i>And to the class of 1973...</i>

1473
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:41,597
<i>... we say, don't forget to remember
yourselves as you are today:</i>

1474
02:04:41,855 --> 02:04:46,896
Full of hope, and the dream that
everything is possible.

1475
02:04:47,151 --> 02:04:49,938
And remember this,
20 years from now...

1476
02:04:50,195 --> 02:04:52,651
...when we all own home computers...

1477
02:04:52,907 --> 02:04:55,907
...and we all travel
in electrical cars...

1478
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:59,410
...that move swiftly,
high above our city...

1479
02:04:59,663 --> 02:05:04,409
...that the key to the future,
is keeping today alive...

1480
02:05:04,668 --> 02:05:06,079
...forever!

1481
02:05:06,795 --> 02:05:09,001
Forever! Forever!

1482
02:05:09,214 --> 02:05:12,582
Penny, no! Wake up!

1483
02:05:16,305 --> 02:05:17,335
Well...

1484
02:05:18,056 --> 02:05:20,594
...now that I have your attention...

1485
02:05:22,059 --> 02:05:26,271
...I know you've heard this before,
and I've never said this to anybody.

1486
02:05:27,106 --> 02:05:31,234
Nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me.

1487
02:05:31,737 --> 02:05:32,934
But...

1488
02:05:33,696 --> 02:05:35,854
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

1489
02:05:36,115 --> 02:05:38,155
You'll never remember this.

1490
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:40,446
I love you.

1491
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:45,204
And I'm about to boldly go where...

1492
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:49,169
...many men have gone before.

1493
02:05:58,595 --> 02:05:59,757
Who do we got here?

1494
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:01,170
- What's her name?
- Emily.

1495
02:06:01,431 --> 02:06:03,258
Okay, sweetheart,
sit up, sit up, sit up.

1496
02:06:03,474 --> 02:06:05,965
- Good girl. What'd you take?
- I'll get her legs.

1497
02:06:06,187 --> 02:06:07,680
- What did you take?
- Okay.

1498
02:06:07,938 --> 02:06:10,095
- What did you take?
- I don't know.

1499
02:06:10,356 --> 02:06:12,645
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.

1500
02:06:13,526 --> 02:06:15,815
Emily, we have
to pump your stomach, okay?

1501
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:20,863
- Emily, wake up.
- Got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

1502
02:06:21,117 --> 02:06:23,525
All right, you'll
have to swallow this tube.

1503
02:06:23,786 --> 02:06:26,028
All right? Open, open, open.

1504
02:06:26,288 --> 02:06:28,910
- Come on.
- Don't fight us, we're trying to help.

1505
02:06:29,166 --> 02:06:32,416
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.

1506
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:33,706
I know. I know.

1507
02:06:33,962 --> 02:06:36,085
Swallow this now.
No, don't bite on it.

1508
02:06:36,339 --> 02:06:38,416
Swallow. Emily, come on, swallow.

1509
02:06:38,675 --> 02:06:41,249
- Just relax. Got it.
- Very good.

1510
02:06:41,511 --> 02:06:43,469
There we go.
All done. All done.

1511
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,721
Feed some liquid into your stomach.

1512
02:07:20,173 --> 02:07:22,546
<i>You never did half
of what you said.</i>

1513
02:07:24,011 --> 02:07:27,047
It was in the middle of
"Midnight Rambler."

1514
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:31,054
Keith Richards saw me...

1515
02:07:31,309 --> 02:07:35,603
...and came to the front
of the stage. He pulled me out...

1516
02:07:35,856 --> 02:07:38,810
...and he took me backstage...

1517
02:07:39,067 --> 02:07:42,815
...and gave me a Coke, ice...

1518
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:45,193
...and a lemon.

1519
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:48,946
And I never went home.

1520
02:07:49,577 --> 02:07:53,160
I've done twice the things
I said I did.

1521
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:56,283
What about your mom?

1522
02:07:58,961 --> 02:08:01,714
She always said, "Marry up.

1523
02:08:01,923 --> 02:08:04,591
Marry someone grand."

1524
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,552
And that's why she named me "Lady."

1525
02:08:09,722 --> 02:08:12,130
She named you "Lady"?

1526
02:08:13,267 --> 02:08:15,093
Lady Goodman.

1527
02:08:16,936 --> 02:08:18,645
Lady Goodman.

1528
02:08:18,981 --> 02:08:20,309
That's great.

1529
02:08:20,523 --> 02:08:22,599
Now you know all my secrets.

1530
02:08:23,067 --> 02:08:24,692
You've got me.

1531
02:08:27,739 --> 02:08:29,613
See you back in the real world.

1532
02:08:30,908 --> 02:08:32,367
Thank you...

1533
02:08:33,286 --> 02:08:35,113
...William Miller.

1534
02:09:05,776 --> 02:09:07,981
Hey, Lady!

1535
02:09:11,281 --> 02:09:14,864
<i>Welcome to Eastern Airlines
nonstop...</i>

1536
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:16,660
<i>... to San Diego.</i>

1537
02:09:16,912 --> 02:09:19,153
<i>In preparation
for our departure today...</i>

1538
02:09:19,414 --> 02:09:23,541
<i>... we'd like to ask, please, that
you extinguish all flammable items...</i>

1539
02:09:23,793 --> 02:09:26,463
<i>... and return all seats
and tray tables to their full...</i>

1540
02:09:33,636 --> 02:09:36,043
<i>- that your seat belts
are securely fastened.</i>

1541
02:09:36,305 --> 02:09:39,923
<i>And do make note
of the emergency exits.</i>

1542
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:39,696
<i>Why didn't you come to the party?
Bob Dylan came.</i>

1543
02:10:39,949 --> 02:10:42,571
He was at our table for
an hour or so, right?

1544
02:10:42,827 --> 02:10:44,026
- Yeah.
- Just rapping.

1545
02:10:44,329 --> 02:10:48,872
Bob Dylan at our fucking table. I was
looking for you to introduce you.

1546
02:10:49,126 --> 02:10:51,118
What happened to you last night?

1547
02:10:51,377 --> 02:10:53,169
It's a long story.

1548
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:05,717
<i>Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.</i>

1549
02:11:05,975 --> 02:11:08,051
<i>We've caught the edge of
an electrical storm.</i>

1550
02:11:08,269 --> 02:11:09,301
Oh, my God.

1551
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,560
<i>- Electrical storm?
- Buckle up tight.</i>

1552
02:11:12,273 --> 02:11:15,025
- Rock and roll.
- We shouldn't be here.

1553
02:11:16,235 --> 02:11:18,607
- My God!
- Whoa, baby!

1554
02:11:22,449 --> 02:11:23,991
<i>Doris, we miss you!</i>

1555
02:11:26,662 --> 02:11:29,995
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

1556
02:11:30,248 --> 02:11:32,954
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1557
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:34,408
I can't breathe, man.

1558
02:11:34,670 --> 02:11:37,505
It'll be a rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

1559
02:11:37,923 --> 02:11:40,675
Just hang in there,
and we'll get you out of this.

1560
02:11:45,638 --> 02:11:48,759
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

1561
02:11:49,017 --> 02:11:51,638
He just said we're gonna die.

1562
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:58,181
Oh, my God!

1563
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:05,280
If something should happen...
Maybe I never said this enough.

1564
02:12:06,868 --> 02:12:08,112
I love all of you.

1565
02:12:15,041 --> 02:12:18,791
I once hit a man in Dearborn,
Michigan. A hit-and-run.

1566
02:12:19,046 --> 02:12:23,792
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...

1567
02:12:24,051 --> 02:12:25,461
...but I'm sorry.

1568
02:12:25,719 --> 02:12:28,388
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

1569
02:12:28,596 --> 02:12:31,170
Oh, my God!

1570
02:12:31,933 --> 02:12:35,184
Look, I love you all too.
You're like family to me!

1571
02:12:35,437 --> 02:12:37,061
Especially since Marna left me.

1572
02:12:37,313 --> 02:12:41,063
I want you to know, if I took
an extra dollar here and there...

1573
02:12:41,318 --> 02:12:43,310
...it's because I knew I'd earned it.

1574
02:12:43,527 --> 02:12:45,900
- I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

1575
02:12:46,906 --> 02:12:49,693
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

1576
02:12:52,287 --> 02:12:55,203
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

1577
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:58,863
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

1578
02:12:59,127 --> 02:13:01,699
It was the summer we were
free of all rules.

1579
02:13:02,879 --> 02:13:06,580
- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.

1580
02:13:07,259 --> 02:13:08,884
None of us love you.

1581
02:13:09,136 --> 02:13:13,299
- You act above us. You always have.
- Finally, the truth.

1582
02:13:13,556 --> 02:13:16,343
You just held it over us,
like you might leave.

1583
02:13:16,602 --> 02:13:20,302
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

1584
02:13:20,898 --> 02:13:22,391
I had to live with you...

1585
02:13:22,649 --> 02:13:26,267
...and now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair!

1586
02:13:26,486 --> 02:13:27,649
Please, enough!

1587
02:13:31,866 --> 02:13:33,610
I'm still in love with you, Leslie.

1588
02:13:33,868 --> 02:13:36,537
I don't want to hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!

1589
02:13:37,705 --> 02:13:39,034
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

1590
02:13:39,290 --> 02:13:43,288
- Whatever happens, you're dead!
- Don't be self-righteous.

1591
02:13:43,544 --> 02:13:44,789
Not now, man.

1592
02:13:45,046 --> 02:13:48,296
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

1593
02:13:48,549 --> 02:13:50,092
...last summer up until yesterday.

1594
02:13:50,343 --> 02:13:51,753
Tell Leslie that!

1595
02:13:52,011 --> 02:13:53,420
- Shut up!
- I quit!

1596
02:13:53,595 --> 02:13:56,169
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

1597
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:57,932
"That groupie"?!

1598
02:13:58,684 --> 02:14:02,551
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

1599
02:14:03,146 --> 02:14:04,604
And you all used her.

1600
02:14:04,856 --> 02:14:08,059
All of you.
You used her and threw her away!

1601
02:14:08,318 --> 02:14:12,316
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan.

1602
02:14:12,573 --> 02:14:16,237
You're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1603
02:14:16,492 --> 02:14:20,572
She was your biggest fan,
and you threw her away!

1604
02:14:20,830 --> 02:14:25,159
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1605
02:14:25,418 --> 02:14:27,706
And I love her! I love her!

1606
02:14:37,387 --> 02:14:38,929
Fuck it!

1607
02:14:39,931 --> 02:14:42,767
I'm... I'm gay!

1608
02:14:57,366 --> 02:15:01,197
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1609
02:16:14,231 --> 02:16:15,809
Write what you want.

1610
02:16:51,183 --> 02:16:53,591
Leave your package on the desk.

1611
02:16:53,853 --> 02:16:57,139
I'm not a messenger,
I'm one of your writers...

1612
02:16:57,357 --> 02:16:59,479
...William H. Miller.

1613
02:17:06,824 --> 02:17:08,817
He's just a kid.

1614
02:17:12,204 --> 02:17:13,995
Go right on in.

1615
02:17:38,146 --> 02:17:40,054
You're William Miller?

1616
02:17:41,941 --> 02:17:46,270
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1617
02:17:46,529 --> 02:17:50,360
Did anything happen?
After $600 in room-service bills?

1618
02:17:50,617 --> 02:17:52,407
Did you tape Hammond?

1619
02:17:52,659 --> 02:17:54,902
Where were you?
What did you want to write?

1620
02:17:55,163 --> 02:17:56,822
This reads like their version.

1621
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,788
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1622
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,125
- Something must've happened.
- Push up Flippo's Who cover.

1623
02:18:02,377 --> 02:18:05,081
Good. It'll take me three
days to do this.

1624
02:18:05,338 --> 02:18:06,833
It's all handwritten...

1625
02:18:07,049 --> 02:18:08,757
...on little bits of paper.

1626
02:18:08,967 --> 02:18:11,589
- It's a puff piece.
- They call women "chicks."

1627
02:18:11,845 --> 02:18:14,881
- I have a problem with that.
- You want them to like you.

1628
02:18:15,389 --> 02:18:19,222
Ben, you told me to send what I had!

1629
02:18:19,477 --> 02:18:22,680
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1630
02:18:56,972 --> 02:18:58,881
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1631
02:18:59,766 --> 02:19:01,308
<i>You made friends with them.</i>

1632
02:19:02,811 --> 02:19:05,384
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

1633
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,732
...to get you drunk
and feel like you belong.

1634
02:19:08,984 --> 02:19:11,605
<i>Well, it was fun.</i>

1635
02:19:11,986 --> 02:19:14,145
Because they make you feel cool.

1636
02:19:15,032 --> 02:19:20,072
<i>- Hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.</i>

1637
02:19:21,246 --> 02:19:23,570
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1638
02:19:23,831 --> 02:19:26,203
Because we are uncool.

1639
02:19:27,127 --> 02:19:30,791
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

1640
02:19:31,046 --> 02:19:34,545
...most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1641
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:38,505
Good-looking people,
they got no spine.

1642
02:19:39,180 --> 02:19:41,634
Their art never lasts.

1643
02:19:42,265 --> 02:19:44,389
They get the girls, but we're smarter.

1644
02:19:46,394 --> 02:19:50,475
<i>- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Because great art is about...</i>

1645
02:19:50,732 --> 02:19:53,767
...guilt and longing...

1646
02:19:54,027 --> 02:19:57,645
...and love disguised as sex,
and sex disguised as love.

1647
02:19:57,905 --> 02:20:02,069
<i>Hey, let's face it,
you got a big head start.</i>

1648
02:20:02,285 --> 02:20:03,530
I'm glad you were home.

1649
02:20:03,786 --> 02:20:06,491
I'm always home. I'm uncool.

1650
02:20:07,165 --> 02:20:09,833
<i>- Me too.
- You're doing great, you know?</i>

1651
02:20:10,459 --> 02:20:12,832
The only true currency in
this bankrupt world...

1652
02:20:13,087 --> 02:20:16,290
...is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

1653
02:20:17,508 --> 02:20:19,667
<i>Listen, my advice to you...</i>

1654
02:20:19,927 --> 02:20:22,500
<i>... I know you think
these guys are your friends...</i>

1655
02:20:23,389 --> 02:20:27,552
...if you want to be a true friend to
them, be honest...

1656
02:20:27,809 --> 02:20:30,431
...and unmerciful.

1657
02:20:31,729 --> 02:20:36,475
"I'm flying over Tupelo, Mississippi,
with America's hottest band...

1658
02:20:36,735 --> 02:20:39,307
...and we're all about to die."

1659
02:20:40,238 --> 02:20:43,441
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

1660
02:20:43,658 --> 02:20:47,952
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll check the quotes.

1661
02:20:51,625 --> 02:20:54,790
<i>I just got off the phone
with Rolling Stone.</i>

1662
02:20:55,002 --> 02:20:58,453
- Me too. What's he using?
- He's using it all.

1663
02:20:58,673 --> 02:21:00,499
This according to the fact checker.

1664
02:21:00,716 --> 02:21:03,290
- So what.
- "So what"?

1665
02:21:03,511 --> 02:21:05,504
We come off like amateurs.

1666
02:21:05,721 --> 02:21:09,933
Some average band trying to
come to grips with success.

1667
02:21:10,142 --> 02:21:12,597
Jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

1668
02:21:12,811 --> 02:21:17,520
We're buffoons!
"Rock'n'roll can save the world"?

1669
02:21:17,733 --> 02:21:21,102
"The chicks are great"?
I sound like a dick.

1670
02:21:21,361 --> 02:21:23,484
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

1671
02:21:23,739 --> 02:21:26,312
Maybe we don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

1672
02:21:26,908 --> 02:21:30,028
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1673
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:34,453
He has you on acid, screaming,
"I'm a golden god."

1674
02:21:34,708 --> 02:21:38,787
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

1675
02:21:39,046 --> 02:21:41,251
Wait. I never said,
"I'm a golden god."

1676
02:21:43,966 --> 02:21:45,295
Or did I?

1677
02:21:45,551 --> 02:21:48,172
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

1678
02:21:48,597 --> 02:21:50,054
I liked him as a person.

1679
02:21:50,265 --> 02:21:54,179
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

1680
02:21:54,519 --> 02:21:58,183
You had the right idea
all along.

1681
02:21:58,772 --> 02:22:01,690
- How about the flight?
- It's all there.

1682
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,309
It's unspecific who says what.

1683
02:22:04,569 --> 02:22:07,571
No names are noted in
the embarrassing sequences.

1684
02:22:07,781 --> 02:22:10,568
It's just obvious who's who
and we're fucked!

1685
02:22:10,783 --> 02:22:14,568
I told him he could write
what he wanted.

1686
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,992
They haven't talked to Russell.

1687
02:22:20,251 --> 02:22:24,997
Deny it to the fact checker.
One call. Then they can't print it.

1688
02:22:25,256 --> 02:22:28,210
- Is that true?
- This is war, my friend.

1689
02:22:28,427 --> 02:22:31,712
If you'd met me earlier,
he'd have never been here.

1690
02:22:31,929 --> 02:22:35,594
He'll live.
Let's identify the goals here:

1691
02:22:36,350 --> 02:22:40,562
T-shirts, foreign markets, your
contract, merchandising...

1692
02:22:40,771 --> 02:22:42,728
...happiness...

1693
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:46,724
...realizing your dreams,
money, cool...

1694
02:22:47,027 --> 02:22:48,985
...meeting the Beatles.

1695
02:22:49,196 --> 02:22:54,735
Let's put all of it in the pot.
It all depends on mystique.

1696
02:22:55,202 --> 02:22:57,954
Not giving too much away.

1697
02:22:58,331 --> 02:23:00,618
I'm going to L.A.
Call if you need me.

1698
02:23:00,832 --> 02:23:05,126
Before I go,
let me give you a lesson in mystique.

1699
02:23:05,337 --> 02:23:08,955
You can only have one.
Which one do you want?

1700
02:23:09,174 --> 02:23:11,747
Which one are you gonna choose?

1701
02:23:13,386 --> 02:23:16,256
As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

1702
02:23:17,765 --> 02:23:20,339
...you'll always want it more.

1703
02:23:24,062 --> 02:23:26,021
It's phenomenal,
to be honest with you.

1704
02:23:26,274 --> 02:23:29,394
Sophisticated, intelligent.
We only cut out a couple of graphs.

1705
02:23:29,652 --> 02:23:32,653
Jeff Bebe's mom sent over
a shoebox full of childhood photos.

1706
02:23:32,906 --> 02:23:34,862
- She did?
- It's gonna look fantastic.

1707
02:23:35,115 --> 02:23:39,409
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

1708
02:23:40,287 --> 02:23:43,703
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1709
02:23:45,334 --> 02:23:47,706
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1710
02:23:48,086 --> 02:23:49,913
He's the one who denied it.

1711
02:23:50,172 --> 02:23:52,129
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

1712
02:23:53,717 --> 02:23:56,919
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

1713
02:23:57,137 --> 02:23:59,889
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

1714
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,259
Ben! Wait!

1715
02:24:28,042 --> 02:24:29,999
You guys, this is my brother.

1716
02:24:30,586 --> 02:24:33,621
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

1717
02:24:34,966 --> 02:24:36,792
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

1718
02:24:37,509 --> 02:24:38,967
I think I'm needed.

1719
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:42,459
See you.

1720
02:24:49,103 --> 02:24:51,179
You look awful.

1721
02:24:52,441 --> 02:24:53,720
But it's great.

1722
02:24:53,942 --> 02:24:55,851
You're living your life.

1723
02:24:56,110 --> 02:24:58,518
You're free of Mom.

1724
02:25:02,491 --> 02:25:05,824
Hey, I'll take off work.

1725
02:25:06,078 --> 02:25:09,744
Let's have an adventure together.
You and me, finally.

1726
02:25:10,458 --> 02:25:15,368
Anywhere you want to go.
Anywhere in the world.

1727
02:25:17,005 --> 02:25:19,128
This isn't my idea of a good time.

1728
02:25:20,426 --> 02:25:22,667
- Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1729
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:08,971
I forgive you.

1730
02:26:11,266 --> 02:26:13,343
I didn't apologize.

1731
02:26:46,717 --> 02:26:47,962
Hey, Sapphire.

1732
02:26:48,177 --> 02:26:49,671
Hey, boy.

1733
02:26:51,181 --> 02:26:54,429
- I hate goodbyes.
- Me too.

1734
02:26:55,892 --> 02:26:58,301
All right, so I didn't like you much.

1735
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:00,809
Do we have to like each other?

1736
02:27:01,523 --> 02:27:04,559
I sort of thought so.

1737
02:27:04,859 --> 02:27:08,774
I think it would've worked
against us, I really do.

1738
02:27:08,989 --> 02:27:13,282
You know what they say: All the
great partnerships hated each other.

1739
02:27:13,994 --> 02:27:16,283
We didn't hate
each other that much, did we?

1740
02:27:16,496 --> 02:27:18,204
No, maybe not.

1741
02:27:18,665 --> 02:27:21,120
I could work on it, though.

1742
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:30,542
I just can't picture you
with Leslie.

1743
02:27:31,386 --> 02:27:35,465
I'm the you they get,
when they can't get you.

1744
02:27:48,735 --> 02:27:51,107
- Sorry.
- Forget it. It's cool.

1745
02:27:51,321 --> 02:27:54,737
- I'll see you later on.
- All right. See you.

1746
02:28:05,586 --> 02:28:07,377
Is Penny okay?

1747
02:28:08,546 --> 02:28:10,206
The Quaaludes incident?

1748
02:28:10,965 --> 02:28:13,042
Well, it wasn't pretty.

1749
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:15,009
She could've died.

1750
02:28:16,345 --> 02:28:20,556
I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1751
02:28:20,767 --> 02:28:23,554
Guess I was wrong.
One of them saved her life.

1752
02:28:25,313 --> 02:28:26,343
William?

1753
02:28:26,605 --> 02:28:30,306
What do you care? I mean,
we all know what you did to him.

1754
02:28:30,568 --> 02:28:33,141
I mean, everybody knows.

1755
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:36,695
Even Penny Lane.

1756
02:28:43,037 --> 02:28:46,075
Something tells me,
20 years from now...

1757
02:28:46,625 --> 02:28:49,246
...we'll remember her.

1758
02:28:49,794 --> 02:28:52,630
And not much else.

1759
02:28:59,512 --> 02:29:01,469
Can you believe these girls?

1760
02:29:01,764 --> 02:29:05,133
None of them use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

1761
02:29:06,143 --> 02:29:10,058
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

1762
02:29:10,774 --> 02:29:14,936
You know, to truly love some
silly little piece of music...

1763
02:29:15,195 --> 02:29:19,143
...or some band so much...

1764
02:29:19,365 --> 02:29:20,823
...that it hurts.

1765
02:29:28,082 --> 02:29:29,113
Hello, Penny?

1766
02:29:29,374 --> 02:29:31,414
<i>It's Russell. Don't hang up.</i>

1767
02:29:31,669 --> 02:29:34,752
<i>I can't really talk now.
I'm in a roomful of people.</i>

1768
02:29:43,263 --> 02:29:45,136
Actually, I'm alone.

1769
02:29:47,683 --> 02:29:49,095
I won't call again, I promise.

1770
02:29:50,311 --> 02:29:54,060
<i>But I need to see you face to face...</i>

1771
02:29:54,274 --> 02:29:57,477
<i>... because I'm never
as good as when you're there...</i>

1772
02:29:57,693 --> 02:30:02,189
<i>... and I can see myself
the way you look at me.</i>

1773
02:30:02,406 --> 02:30:06,903
<i>And I'm sorry. If we could
just get together and talk...</i>

1774
02:30:12,499 --> 02:30:14,576
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1775
02:30:18,964 --> 02:30:20,209
<i>Give me your address.</i>

1776
02:30:22,843 --> 02:30:24,634
I'm coming to you...

1777
02:30:25,553 --> 02:30:27,131
...this time.

1778
02:30:41,486 --> 02:30:43,312
<i>Got a pen?</i>

1779
02:31:02,214 --> 02:31:03,709
Hello, Penny.

1780
02:31:03,966 --> 02:31:05,757
Hello, Penny.

1781
02:31:17,687 --> 02:31:19,514
I'm Russell Hammond.

1782
02:31:20,941 --> 02:31:24,724
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

1783
02:31:30,825 --> 02:31:32,023
Come in.

1784
02:31:38,123 --> 02:31:41,824
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1785
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:51,386
- Where am I?
- Hello?

1786
02:31:52,221 --> 02:31:53,251
Hi.

1787
02:31:53,931 --> 02:31:57,382
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1788
02:32:20,623 --> 02:32:22,912
Oh, man...

1789
02:32:30,716 --> 02:32:33,253
My son is very important to me too.

1790
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:36,132
And I do think you owe him
an apology.

1791
02:32:37,264 --> 02:32:40,431
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree.

1792
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:48,558
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

1793
02:33:03,624 --> 02:33:04,821
Well...

1794
02:33:10,963 --> 02:33:12,077
Hi.

1795
02:33:13,424 --> 02:33:15,251
So this is...

1796
02:33:17,219 --> 02:33:18,927
...where the Enemy sleeps.

1797
02:33:25,353 --> 02:33:28,804
You know, I think we both
wanted to be with her.

1798
02:33:33,694 --> 02:33:36,100
And she wanted us to be together.

1799
02:33:51,419 --> 02:33:53,292
You should give her a call.

1800
02:33:54,130 --> 02:33:55,838
You both live in the same city.

1801
02:34:01,178 --> 02:34:03,467
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1802
02:34:06,809 --> 02:34:09,264
That girl really cares about you.

1803
02:34:12,189 --> 02:34:14,062
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1804
02:34:21,156 --> 02:34:24,276
Oh, I called your magazine...

1805
02:34:24,993 --> 02:34:26,985
...and told them the truth.

1806
02:34:29,331 --> 02:34:33,245
I don't know what they'll do, but I
said every word you wrote was true.

1807
02:34:40,633 --> 02:34:44,713
We are gonna do this one more time.

1808
02:34:56,816 --> 02:34:57,847
So, Russell...

1809
02:35:00,861 --> 02:35:03,269
...what do you love about music?

1810
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:15,576
To begin with...

1811
02:35:17,001 --> 02:35:18,282
...everything.

1812
02:35:26,678 --> 02:35:28,717
- Tickets!
- How much?

1813
02:35:45,154 --> 02:35:47,360
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
