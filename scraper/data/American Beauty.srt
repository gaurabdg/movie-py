in front of your eyes
the second before you die.

First of all,
that one second...

1286
01:53:07,327 --> 01:53:10,091
isn't a second at all.

1287
01:53:10,163 --> 01:53:12,256
It stretches on forever,

1288

like an ocean of time.

1289
01:53:17,104 --> 01:53:20,130
For me, it was
lying on my back...

at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.

to relax...

and stop trying
to hold on to it.

And then it flows
through me like rain,

but gratitude...
