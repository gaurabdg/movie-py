00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,677
Oh-ho.

3
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,820
Whoo.

4
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,635
Oh!

5
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,813
Whoo.

6
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,718
All right, Curly,
enough's enough.

7
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,450
You can't eat
the venetian blinds.

8
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,617
I just had them
installed on Wednesday.

9
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,499
Whoo.

10
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,303
Down the hatch.

11
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,374
Oh.

12
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,788
She's no good.

13
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,758
What can I say?
You're right.

14
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,260
When you're right,
you're right,

15
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,761
and you're right.

16
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:19,265
I'll pay you
the rest next week.

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,767
We only caught
60 ton of skipjack.

18
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,770
They don't pay
for skipjack

19
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,271
as they do albacore.

20
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,772
Forget it, Curly.

21
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,775
I was only
illustrating a point.

22
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:30,777
I don't want
your last dime.

23
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,779
Who do you think I am?

24
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:34,280
Thank you, Mr. Gittes.

25
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,781
Call me Jake.

26
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,408
Careful driving home,
Curl, huh?

27
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,179
A Mrs. Mulwray's
waiting for you

28
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,414
with Mr. Walsh
and Mr. Duffy.

29
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,921
[Door Opens]

30
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,016
Mrs. Mulwray,
may I present Mr. Gittes.

31
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,391
Mrs. Mulwray,
how do you do?

32
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,123
Mr. Gittes.

33
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:54,190
Now, uh, what seems
to be the problem?

34
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,395
My husband,

35
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,995
I believe, is seeing
another woman.

36
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,166
No. Really?

37
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,904
I'm afraid so.

38
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,536
I am sorry.

39
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,046
Mr. Gittes, please,

40
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,207
could we
discuss this alone?

41
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,319
I'm afraid not,
Mrs. Mulwray.

42
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,820
These are my operatives.

43
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,086
At some point,
they'll have to assist me.

44
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,183
I can't do
everything myself.

45
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,922
Of course not.

46
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,258
Now...

47
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:31,398
what makes you certain
that your husband is, uh...

48
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,099
involved with someone?

49
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,606
A wife can tell.

50
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:40,045
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

51
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,638
Yes, of course.

52
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,240
Then go home
and forget everything.

53
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,253
I'm sure he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.

54
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,882
Do you know the expression
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

55
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,950
You're... you're
better off not knowing.

56
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,518
I have to know.

57
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,663
Very well.

58
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,671
What is your husband's
first name?

59
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,036
Hollis.

60
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,335
Hollis Mulwray.

61
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,176
Water and Power?

62
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,712
He's chief engineer.

63
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,045
Chief engineer?

64
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,491
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

65
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,992
this type of investigation

66
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,996
can be hard
on your pocketbook.

67
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,191
It takes time...

68
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,757
Money doesn't matter
to me, Mr. Gittes.

69
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,039
O.K., we'll, uh...

70
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,542
we'll see what we can do.

71
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,543
Gentlemen, today you
can walk out that door,

72
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,046
hop a streetcar,

73
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,548
and within 25 minutes

74
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,641
end up
in the Pacific Ocean.

75
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,153
You can swim
and fish in it,

76
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,155
but you can't drink it,

77
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,158
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

78
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,093
Now remember, we live
next door to the ocean,

79
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,097
but we also
live next to a desert.

80
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,861
Los Angeles
is a desert community.

81
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,368
Beneath this building,

82
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,734
beneath our streets
is a desert.

83
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,740
Without water, the dust
will rise and cover us

84
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,173
as though
we never existed.

85
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,679
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

86
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:23,410
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

87
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,418
is a fair price to pay

88
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,920
to keep the desert
from our streets

89
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,819
and not on top of them.

90
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,120
[Applause]

91
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:38,425
Mayor Bagby, let's hear from
all the departments again.

92
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,559
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.

93
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,795
Mr. Mulwray?

94
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,582
In case you've forgotten,
gentlemen,

95
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,584
over 500 lives were lost

96
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,382
when the Van der Lip Dam
gave way.

97
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,219
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

98
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,226
is shale similar
to the permeable shale

99
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,229
in the Van der Lip
disaster.

100
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,232
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

101
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,736
Now you propose yet another
dirt-banked terminus dam

102
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,238
with slopes of 21/2 to 1,

103
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,739
112 feet high,

104
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,709
and a 12,000-acre
water surface.

105
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,836
Well, it won't hold.

106
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,473
I won't build it.
It's that simple.

107
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:32,383
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

Where should I take them?

115
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:53,540
You don't have an answer
for that so quick, do you?

116
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,973
You steal water
from the valley,

117
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,637
ruin the grazing,

118
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,737
starve the livestock.

119
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,214
Who's paying you
to do that, Mr. Mulwray?

120
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,251
That's what
I want to know!

00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,597
O.K., pal,

167
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,438
let's have us
a big smile.

168
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,450
You'll love it.

169
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,952
No mires para atras.

170
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,455
Cubrete los ojos.

171
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,089
Te gusta?

172
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,997
Estas bonita.

173
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,002
Oh, here. Let me...

174
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,699
[Crash]

175
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,883
When you get
so much publicity,

176
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,385
you got to get
blasé about it.

177
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,887
Let's face it, Jake,

178
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,388
you're practically
a movie star.

179

[Horn Honks]

180
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,327
Look at that, Barn.

181
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,057
Yeah, the heat's murder.

182
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,325
Sure is.

183
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,061
Fools' names
and fools' faces.

184
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,535
What's that, pal?

185
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,041
Nothing. You got
a hell of a way

186
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,542
to make a living.

187
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,546
Oh? What do you do
to make ends meet?

00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,378
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.

189
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,384
Tell me,
did you foreclose

190
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,317
on many families
this week?

191
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,049
We don't publish
a record in the paper.

192
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,556
Neither do I.

193
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,684
No, your
press agent does it.

194
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,193
Who is this bimbo,
Barney?

195
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,696
Is he a regular
customer or what?

196
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,698
I make
an honest living.

197
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,200
People come to me when
they're desperate.

198
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,204
I don't kick families
out of their houses

199
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,706
like you bums
at the bank do.

200
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,709
Maybe you'd like
to go outside and discuss it.

201
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,210
What do you think?

202
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,214
I don't know how it got
in the newspaper.

203
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,217
It was so quick,
I didn't know it myself.

204
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,718
Make an honest
living.

205
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,219
Of course you do.

206
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,223
Anyway, this guy got tired
of screwing his wife...

207
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,486
An honest living,
understand?

208
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,494
Do what the Chinese do.

209
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,995
He says, "What's that?"

210
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,928
The Chinese
screw a little...

211
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,301
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

212
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,805
Sophie, go to
the little girl's room, O.K.?

213
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,533
But, Mr. Gittes...

214
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,734
Sophie...

215
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,242
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

216
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,677
I want to tell you
a story.

217
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,681
There's this guy,
Walsh, understand?

218
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,183
He's tired of
screwing his wife.

219
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,343
Jake...

220
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,353
You're always
in such a hurry.

221
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,854
So his friend says,

222
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,357
"Do it like
the Chinese do."

223
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,222
How do the Chinese
do it?

224
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,229
The guy says,
"First they screw a little,

225
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,232
"then they stop
and read a little Confucius.

226
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,997
Then they screw a little more,
then stop again..."

227
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,298
Jake.

228
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,169
Walsh, just listen
to me for a second.

229
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,175
I mean,
you'll love this.

230
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,473
"Then they screw
a little more,

231
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,480
then they contemplate
the moon or something..."

232
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,981
Makes it more exciting.

233
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,984
Now the guy goes home

234
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,316
and starts screwing
his own wife.

235
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,821
He screws a little,
then stops.

236
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,324
He goes and reads
Life magazine,

237
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,826
then he returns
and starts screwing again.

238
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,331
He says, "Excuse me, honey,"
and smokes a cigarette.

239
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,332
Now his wife
is getting sore.

240
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,834
He comes back,
starts screwing again,

241
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,837
gets up to leave again.

242
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,600
She says,
"What's the matter?

243
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,107
You're screwing
just like a Chinaman!"

244
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,273
Jesus!

245
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,075
That Barney!

246
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,948
Mr. Gittes.

247
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,315
Yes.

248
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,824
Do you know me?

249
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,821
Well, uh...

250
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,456
I think
I would have remembered.

251
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,397
Have we ever met?

252
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,236
Well, no.

253
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,795
Never?

254
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,534
Never.

255
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,041
That's what I thought.

256
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,135
You see,
I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray,

257
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,702
Mr. Mulwray's wife.

258
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,472
Not, uh...

259
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,279
that Mulwray?

260
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes, Mr. Gittes,
that Mulwray.

261
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,648
And since
you agree with me

262
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,157
that we've
never met before,

263
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,659
you must also agree

264
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,661
that I've
never hired you,

265
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,163
certainly not to spy
on my husband.

266
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,861
I see you like
publicity, Mr. Gittes.

267
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,166
Well, you're
going to get it.

268
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,672
Wait a minute,
Mrs. Mulwray.

269
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,173
There's been some
misunderstanding here.

270
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,676
There's no point
in getting tough...

271
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,838
I don't get tough
with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

272
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,506
My lawyer does.

273
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,018
Uh, here's something
for you, Mr. Gittes.

274
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,349
Uh...

275
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,858
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

276
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,774
Mr. Mulwray.

277
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,208
He's not in, Mr...

278
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,370
Gittes.

279
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,879
What is this
regarding?

280
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,380
It's
a personal matter.

281
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,882
Has he
been gone long?

282
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,212
Since lunch.

283
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,219
Gee whiz,
and I'm late.

284
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,379
He was expecting you?

285
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,652
15 minutes ago.
I'll just go in and wait.

286
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,688
Sir?

287
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,931
Is Mr. Yelburton
there?

288
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,658
He's still
in the building?

289
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,694
Very well.
Thank you.

290
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,187
Can I help you?

291
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,917
Russ Yelburton,
deputy chief of the department.

292
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,253
J.J. Gittes.

293
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,261
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

294
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,763
Would you care to wait
in my office?

295
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,094
Certainly.

296
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,599
We're nervous
around here

297
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,102
with all this business
in the papers

298
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,933
about Mr. Mulwray.

299
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,438
Uh, right this way.

300
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,247
After you've worked
with a man

301
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,749
for a certain
length of time,

302
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,377
you come to know
his habits, his values.

303
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,943
You come to know him.

304
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,388
Either he's the kind
who chases women or he isn't.

305
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,891
And Mulwray isn't?

306
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,155
He never even kids
about it.

307
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,164
Well, maybe he takes it
very seriously.

308
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,667
Uh, sit down.

309
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,168
Uh, no, thank you.

310
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,831
Do you know where
Mulwray's having lunch?

311
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,340
No, I'm sorry,
I don't.

312
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,343
Well, uh, tell him
I'll be back.

313
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,673
I will.

314
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,681
Do you mind
if I take your card?

315
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,683
In case
I need you again.

316
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,184
No, help yourself.

317
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,688
Mulvihill,
what are you doing here?

318
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,694
They shut my water off.

319
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,196
How'd you find out
about it?

320
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,697
You don't drink it.

321
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,700
You don't
take a bath in it.

322
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,702
They wrote you
a letter.

323
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,637
But then you'd have to
be able to read.

324
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,775
Relax, Mulvihill.
Glad to see you.

325
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,470
You know Claude
Mulvihill here?

326
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,979
I hope so.
He's working for us.

327
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,309
Doing what?

328
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,815
There have been
some threats

329
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,818
to blow up
the city reservoirs.

330
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,319
Any particular
reason?

331
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,322
It's this drought.
We rationed water in the valley.

332
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,823
The farmers
are desperate,

333
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,826
but the city
needs drinking water.

334
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,828
Well, you're in luck,
Mr. Yelburton.

335
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,124
How's that?

336
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,495
When Mulvihill
was sheriff of Ventura County,

337
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,002
the rum runners
landed tons of booze on the beach

338
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,003
and never lost
a drop.

339
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,504
He ought to hold on

340
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,507
to your water
for you.

341
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,625
[Ring]

342
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,203
J.J. Gittes
to see Mr. Mulwray.

343
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,290
Please.

344
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,307
You wait.

345
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,791
Oh.

346
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,645
Heh.

347
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,408
Bad for glass.

348
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,309
Yeah, sure.

349
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,506
Bad for the glass.

350
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,280
Mr. Gittes.

351
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,446
Actually, I came
to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

352
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,125
Would you like
something to drink?

353
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,626
What are you having?

354
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,821
Iced tea.

355
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,830
That'll be fine,
thank you.

356
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,331
Two iced teas,
Khan, please?

357
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,492
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,962
My husband's
at the office.

359
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,973
Actually, he's not,
Mrs. Mulwray,

360
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,475
and he's checked out
of his apartment

361
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,976
at the El Macondo.

362
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,275
That's not
his apartment.

363
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,381
Anyway, I, uh...

364
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,886
The point is,
I'm not in business to be loved,

365
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,887
but I am in business.

366
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,924
Whoever set your husband up
set me up.

367
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,392
L.A.'s a small town.
People talk.

368
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,396
I don't want to become
a local joke.

369
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,898
Mr. Gittes, you've
talked me into it.

370
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,399
I'll drop the lawsuit.

371
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,560
What?

372
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,069
I'll drop the lawsuit.

373
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,832
Let's drop
the whole thing.

374
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,271
Sugar, lemon, or both?

375
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,140
Both. Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't want to drop it.

376
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,581
I better talk
to your husband about this.

377
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,015
Why? What on earth for?

378
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,054
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

379
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,022
I've been accused
of a lot of things before,

380
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,025
Mrs. Mulwray,
but never that.

381
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,028
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

382
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,030
and I intend to find out.

383
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,033
I'm not supposed to be caught
with my pants down.

384
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,036
Unless it's a problem,
I'll talk to your husband.

385
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,038
Why should it
be a problem?

386
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,539
May I speak frankly?

387
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,542
You may if you can,
Mr. Gittes.

388
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,544
Well, that little
girlfriend was pretty

389
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,547
in a cheap
sort of a way, of course.

390
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,980
She's disappeared.

391
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,813
Maybe they disappeared
together.

392
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,318
Suppose they did.

393
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,320
How does that
affect you?

394
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,379
It's nothing personal,
Mrs. Mulwray.

395
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,822
It's very personal.

396
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,826
It couldn't
be more personal.

397
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,988
Is this a business or
an obsession with you?

398
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,464
Let's look at it this way.

399
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,900
Now, this phony broad...
excuse the language...

400
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,403
she tells me she's you.

401
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,904
She hires me.

402
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,407
Whoever's behind it
has nothing against me.

403
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,908
They're after
your husband.

404
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,912
If I can see him,
I can help him.

405
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,212
Did you talk to him
this morning?

406
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,718
No, uh...

407
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,720
I went riding
rather early.

408
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,484
Looks like you went
quite a distance.

409
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,025
I was riding bareback.

410
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,123
You, um...

411
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,130
you might try
the Oak Pass

412
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,631
or the Stone Canyon
Reservoir.

413
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,360
Frequently Hollis
walks around them.

414
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,527
Otherwise, he'll
be home by 6:30.

415
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,195
I'll stop by.

416
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,705
Please call first.

417
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,019
Sorry, closed
to the public, sir.

418
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:04,324
Oh, uh, that's
all right, officer.

419
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,658
Russ Yelburton,

420
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,325
deputy chief
of the department.

421
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,867
Sorry, Mr. Yelburton.

422
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,334
Go on down.

423
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,495
That's O.K.

424
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,862
Gittes!
For Christ's sake.

425
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,023
Loach.

426
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,032
Get out before
he sees you.

427
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,590
What's going on here?

428
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,727
Loach!

429
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,769
Hello, Jake.

430
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,672
Lou. How are you?

431
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,176
Lousy cold
I can't seem to shake,

432
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,043
but otherwise,
uh, I'm O.K.

433
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,049
Yeah, summer colds
are the worst.

434
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,482
Yeah, they are.

435
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,985
There's no smoking...

436
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,487
That's all right, officer.

437
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,988
We'll make an exception.

438
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,992
I'll see he's careful
and doesn't burn himself.

439
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,322
Thanks, Lou.

440
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,828
How'd you get
past the guard?

441
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:16,501
To tell you the truth,
I lied a little.

442
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,731
You look like you've
done well by yourself.

443
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,238
I get by.

444
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,739
Sometimes
it takes a while

445
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,742
for a man
to find himself.

446
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,243
Maybe you have.

447
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,007
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

448
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,514
Yeah. Tell me,

449
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,016
you still putting
Chinamen in jail

450
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:36,020
for spitting
in the laundry?

451
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,522
You're a little
behind the times, Jake.

452
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,717
They use steam irons now,

453
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,522
and I'm out of Chinatown.

454
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,324
Since when?

455
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,194
Since I made lieutenant.

456
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,066
Congratulations.

457
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,263
Mmm. What are you
doing around here?

458
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,771
I'm looking
for somebody.

459
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,432
Who?

460
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,443
Hollis Mulwray.
You seen him?

461
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,138
Yeah.

462
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,647
I'd like
to talk to him.

463
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,683
You'd like
to talk to him.

464
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,311
You're welcome to try.

465
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,988
There he is.

466
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,508
Looks like
he was washed down

467
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,342
the entire length
of the runoff channel.

468
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:36,847
Could he swim?

469
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,507
Of course.

470
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,677
Obviously the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

471
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,523
Mrs. Mulwray,

472
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,527
this alleged affair your
husband was having...

473
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,529
the publicity...

474
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:56,533
didn't make him
morose or unhappy?

475
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,968
It didn't
make him happy.

476
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,471
There is no possibility

477
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,303
that he would have
taken his own life?

478
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,467
No.

479
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,979
Mrs. Mulwray...

480
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,981
Do you happen
to know the name

481
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,483
of the young lady
in question?

482
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,985
No.

483
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,315
Or where
she might be?

484
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,480
Certainly not.

485
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,992
You and your husband
never discussed her?

486
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,493
He...

487
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,995
We... we did.

488
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,499
He... he wouldn't
tell me her name.

489
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,660
We quarreled over her,
of course.

490
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,000
It came as a complete
surprise to me.

491
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,504
A complete surprise?

492
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,508
I thought you hired

662

663
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,033
Sure.

664
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,041
How do you like
them apples?

665
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,003
Madam.

666
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,006
Thank you for coming.

667
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,019
Yes, sir?

668

Drink?

669
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,456
Tom Collins with lime,
not lemon, please.

670
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,958
Tom Collins
with lime.

671
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:09,298
I got your check
in the mail.

672
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,460
Yes. As I said,
I was very grateful.

673
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:16,267
Uh, Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

674
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,978
How much
would you like?

675
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:24,480
Oh, stop it.
The money's fine.

676
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,483
It's generous,
but, uh...

677
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:31,487
I think you shortchanged me
on the story.

678
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,487
I have?

679
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,148
I think so.

680
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,490
Something besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

681
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,995
You were upset,
but not that upset.

682
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:43,090
Mr. Gittes, don't
tell me how I feel.

683
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,002
Sorry.

684
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,507
Look, you sue me,
your husband dies,

685
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,009
you drop the lawsuit
like a hot potato...

686
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,514
All of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

687
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,014
Excuse me.

688
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:02,280
Then you ask me
to lie to the police.

689
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,287
It wasn't much
of a lie.

690
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,949
If your husband
was killed, it was.

691
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,458
This could look
like you paid me off

692
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:10,960
to withhold evidence.

693
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,461
But he wasn't
killed.

694
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,593
Mrs. Mulwray, I think
you're hiding something.

695
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,234
Well...

696
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,977
I suppose I am.

697
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,344
Actually, I knew
about the affair.

698
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:34,111
How did you find out?

699
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,482
My husband.

700
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,487
He told you?

701
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,490
And you weren't
the least bit upset?

702
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,219
I was grateful.

703
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,496
Mrs. Mulwray, you'll
have to explain that.

704
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:47,826
Why?

705
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,832
Look, I do
matrimonial work.

706
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,333
It's my metier.

707
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,994
When a wife says
she's happy

708
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,004
that her husband's
cheating on her,

709
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,506
it runs contrary
to my experience.

710
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:58,507
Unless what?

711
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,275
She was
cheating on him.

712
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:06,948
Were you?

713
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,457
I dislike
the word "cheat."

714
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:16,959
Did you
have affairs?

715
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,119
Mr. Gittes...

716
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,959
Did he know
about it?

717
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,464
I wouldn't tell him

718
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,127
every time I went
to bed with someone,

719
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,635
if that's
what you mean.

720
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,639
Anything else you want
to know about me?

721
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,642
Where were you
when your husband died?

722
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,473
I can't tell you.

723
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,479
You mean
you don't know?

724
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,481
I mean
I can't tell you.

725
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,983
You were seeing
someone, too.

726
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,484
For very long?

727
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:46,489
I don't see anyone for
very long, Mr. Gittes.

728
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,491
It's difficult for me.

729
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,996
Now, I think you know

730
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,498
all you need know
about me.

731
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,000
I didn't want publicity.

732
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,935
I didn't want to go
into any of this

733
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,438
then or now.

734
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,030
Is that all?

735
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,445
Oh, by the way,

736
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,482
what does this "C"
stand for?

737
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,948
Cu...

738
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:14,950
Uh, Cross.

739
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,113
That's your
maiden name?

740
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,451
Yes.

741
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,821
Why?

742
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,122
No reason.

743
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,889
You must've had
a reason to ask.

744
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,397
No. I'm just a snoop.

745
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:35,972
Oh, no. I have
my own car.

746
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,972
The Packard.

747
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,474
Wait a minute,
sonny.

748
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,477
I think you better
come with me.

749
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,477
But why?

750
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,138
There's nothing
more to say.

751
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,478
Will you get
my car, please?

752
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,486
O.K., go home.

753
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,488
But in case
you're interested,

754
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,989
your husband
was murdered.

755
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:56,652
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tons of water

756
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,490
from the city's
reservoirs,

757
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,497
and we're supposed
to be in the middle of a drought.

758
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,499
He found out
and was killed.

759
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,501
A waterlogged drunk's
in the morgue...

760
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,661
Involuntary
manslaughter

761
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,500
if anybody wants
to take the trouble,

762
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:09,834
which they don't.

763
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,501
Half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

764
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,510
which is fine by me.

765
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,011
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

766
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,844
I goddamn near
lost my nose,

767
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,178
and I like it.

768
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,013
I like breathing
through it.

769
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:25,522
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

J.J. Gittes
to see Mr. Yelburton.

772
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,010
Mr. Yelburton will
be busy for some time.

00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,512
Well, it's
my lunch hour.

774

I can wait.

775

He's liable to be
tied up indefinitely.

776
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,520
I take a long
lunch hour.

Yes... no.

Well, did he
or didn't he?

783
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,626
He owned it.

He owned it.

the water department?

Yes.

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,534

the entire water supply

for the city?

Yes.

00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,476
How did they
get it away from him?

791
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:05,946
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

Mr. Mulwray?

00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,485
I thought you said
Cross owned it.

794
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:12,817
Along with
Mr. Mulwray.

795

Mr. Gittes, sorry
to keep you waiting.

These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,480
Yeah. Must be
especially tough

to take over
under these circumstances.

00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,477
Oh, yes. Hollis was
the best department chief

what happened to your nose?

Cut myself shaving.

You ought
to be more careful.

you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray.

Neither do I,

You hired me,

or you hired
that chippy to hire me.

Mr. Gittes, you're not
making a bit of sense.

Well, let's
look at it this way...

to build a dam.

00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:01,792
that was hard
to get around.

823
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,457
You decided
to ruin it.

824
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,625
Then he found out

825
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,135
you were dumping water
at night.

826
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,400
Then he was, uh...
drowned.

827
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,374
Mr. Gittes, that's
an outrageous accusation.

828
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,139
I don't know what
you're talking about.

829
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:20,148
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

830
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,480
Dumping thousands
of gallons of water

831
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,816
down the toilet
during a drought...

832
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,549
That's, uh, news.

833
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:30,491
Mr. Gittes, uh...

834
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,993
we're...

835
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:34,996
we're not anxious
for this to get around,

836
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,498
but we have been
diverting a little water

837
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,001
to irrigate orange groves
in the northwest valley.

838
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:43,505
The farmers there
have no legal right to our water.

839
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,007
We've been helping
some of them out.

840
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,009
Naturally,
when you divert water,

841
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,341
there's
a little runoff.

842
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,005
Yeah.
A little runoff.

843
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,675
Where'd you say
those groves were?

844
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,514
In the northwest
valley.

845
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,020
That's like saying
they're in Arizona.

846
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:01,955
Mr. Gittes,
my field men are out.

847
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,619
I can't give you
the exact location.

848
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,685
You're a married man,
aren't you?

849
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:07,889
Yes.

850
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,397
Hard-working?

851
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:11,456
Wife? Kids?

852
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,831
Yes.

853
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,132
I don't want
to nail you.

854
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,307
I want to find out
who put you up to it.

855
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:25,472
I'll give you a few days
to think about it.

856
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,482
Call me. I can help.

857
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,574
Who knows?

858
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,482
Maybe we can put
the whole thing off

859
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,487
on a few big shots,

860
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,648
and you can stay
head of the department

861
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,817
for the next 20 years.

862
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:07,383
[Door Closes]

863
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,525
Drink?

864
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,501
No, thank you.

865
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,935
What is
your usual salary?

866
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,377
$35 a day,

867
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:33,006
plus 20
to my associates,

868
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,949
plus expenses,

869
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,750
plus a bonus
if I show results.

870
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:42,290
Whoever is behind
my husband's death,

871
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,293
why have they gone
to all of this trouble?

872
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,385
Money.

873
00:57:46,462 --> 00:57:48,726
How they
planned to make it

874
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,231
out of
emptying reservoirs,

875
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,562
that I don't know.

876
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,730
I'll pay your salary
plus $5,000

877
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,706
if you find out
what happened to Hollis

878
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,299
and who is involved.

879
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:08,684
Sophie, draw up one of
our standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.

880
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,309
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

881
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,384
Tell me something, uh...

882
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,393
did you get married
before or after

883
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,328
Mulwray and your father
sold the water department?

884
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,662
Noah Cross is
your father, isn't he?

885
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,438
Yes, of course.

886
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:30,938
It was sometime after.

887
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:35,740
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

888
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,839
Then you married
your father's business partner?

889
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:47,183
You've already got
one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

890
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:48,280
Oh.

891
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,689
Does, uh...

892
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,694
my talking about
your father upset you?

893
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,957
Why, no.

894
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,464
Yes. A little.

895
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:57,464
You see,

896
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,467
Hollis and my f-f...

897
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:04,666
my father had
a falling-out finally.

898
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,677
Over you or over
the water department?

899
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,872
Why should it
be over me?

900
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,381
Then it was over
the water department.

901
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,882
Yes. Hollis felt

902
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,385
that the water should
belong to the public,

903
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,287
and I don't think
my father felt that way.

904
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,292
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

905
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,385
You know,
the dam that broke.

906
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:27,394
Oh, yeah?

907
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,897
Yes. Hollis never
forgave him for it.

908
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,900
Never forgave him
for what?

909
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,902
For talking him
into building it.

910
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,905
They never spoke
from that time on.

911
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:42,038
You sure about that?

912
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,443
Of course
I'm sure.

913
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:51,249
Sign here.

914
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,280
The copy's
for you.

915
01:00:56,785 --> 01:00:58,047
Mr. Gitts?

916
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,280
Gittes.

917
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,287
Oh.

918
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,187
How do you do?

919
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:05,192
You've got a nasty
reputation, Mr. Gitts.

920
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,693
I like that.

921
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:07,751
Thanks.

922
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,229
If you were
a bank president,

923
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,856
that would
be one thing,

924
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,867
but in your business,
it's admirable,

925
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,368
and it's
good advertising.

926
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:15,869
It doesn't hurt.

927
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:19,396
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

928
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,567
Probably.

929
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:23,577
But I'm surprised you're
still working for her,

930
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:26,580
unless she's come up
with another husband.

931
01:01:26,648 --> 01:01:30,277
No. She thinks the
last one was murdered.

932
01:01:30,352 --> 01:01:33,947
Uh... how'd
she get that idea?

933
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,958
I think
I gave it to her.

934
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,462
I believe they
should be served with the head.

935
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:44,465
Fine. Long as you
don't serve chicken that way.

936
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,763
Ha ha ha ha.

937
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:47,767
Tell me,

938
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:49,770
what do
the police say?

939
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:52,170
They're calling it
an accident.

940
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:55,368
Who's the investigating
officer?

941
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,376
Lou Escobar.

942
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:57,878
He's a lieutenant.

943
01:01:57,946 --> 01:01:59,379
Do you know him?

944
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:00,380
Oh, yeah.

945
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,848
Where from?

946
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:04,852
We used
to work together.

947
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,887
In Chinatown.

948
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,624
Would you call him
a capable man?

949
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:12,216
Very.

950
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:14,228
Honest?

951
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,230
As far as it goes.

952
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:20,735
He has to swim
in the same water we all do.

953
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:24,034
But you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

954
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:25,038
None.

955
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:26,369
That's too bad.

956
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:27,466
Too bad?

957
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:28,805
It disturbs me.

958
01:02:28,877 --> 01:02:32,278
Makes me think you're taking
my daughter for a ride.

959
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,781
Financially speaking,
of course.

960
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,876
What are you
charging her?

961
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:40,921
My usual fee,

962
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:43,924
plus a bonus
if I get results.

963
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:46,324
Are you, uh,
sleeping with her?

964
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:52,399
You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?

965
01:02:53,902 --> 01:02:57,838
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

966
01:02:57,906 --> 01:03:01,501
I'll put one
of my men on the job.

967
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,509
Good afternoon.

968
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,510
Mr. Gitts...

969
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,671
Gittes.

970
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:07,010
Gittes. You're dealing
with a disturbed woman

971
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:09,016
who just lost her husband.

972
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:12,019
I don't want her
taken advantage of.

973
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,019
Sit down.

974
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:14,020
What for?

975
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,494
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

976
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:22,029
but believe me,
you don't.

977
01:03:23,098 --> 01:03:24,531
Why is that funny?

978
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,534
It's what
the district attorney

979
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,036
used to tell me
in Chinatown.

980
01:03:29,104 --> 01:03:30,537
Yeah? Was he right?

981
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:33,541
Exactly what
do you know about me?

982
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:34,541
Sit down.

983
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:41,214
Mainly
that you're rich

984
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:44,878
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

985
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:46,818
Of course
I'm respectable.

986
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,356
I'm old.

987
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,786
Politicians, ugly
buildings, and whores

988
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,829
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

989
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,331
I'll double
whatever your fee is

990
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:58,832
and pay you $10,000

991
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,028
if you find
Hollis' girlfriend.

992
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,695
Girlfriend?

993
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:04,204
Disappeared,
hasn't she?

994
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,740
Yeah.

995
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:08,742
Wouldn't it be useful
to talk to her?

996
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,868
Maybe.

997
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:12,345
If Mulwray was murdered,

998
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:16,350
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

999
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:19,353
When's the last time
you saw Mulwray?

1000
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:22,189
Sheriff's gold posse.

1001
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:23,690
Bunch of damn fools.

1002
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,695
They paid $5,000 apiece towards
the sheriff's re-election.

1003
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:31,062
I let them practice up
out here.

1004
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,363
Yeah.

1005
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:36,893
Do you remember the last
time you saw Mulwray?

1006
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,907
At my age,
you tend to forget.

1007
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:42,910
Five days ago outside
the Pig 'n Whistle,

1008
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:45,913
and you had one hell
of an argument.

1009
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,848
I got the pictures
in my office

1010
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:50,851
if that'll
help you remember.

1011
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,823
What was
the argument about?

1012
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:57,085
My daughter.

1013
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,893
What about her?

1014
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:04,729
Just find the girl,
Mr. Gitts.

1015
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:11,899
I happen to know
Hollis was... fond of her.

1016
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:14,909
I'd like
to help her if I can.

1017
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,410
I had no idea

1018
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:19,914
you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

1019
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,109
Hollis Mulwray
made this city,

1020
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,709
and he made me
a fortune.

1021
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:30,081
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

1022
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:34,328
If you
want to hire me,

1023
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:35,829
I still have to know

1024
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:37,831
what the argument
was about.

1025
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:41,335
My daughter's
a very jealous woman.

1026
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:44,372
I didn't want her
to find out about the girl.

1027
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:46,304
How did you
find out?

1028
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,811
I still got a few teeth
left in my head

1029
01:05:49,878 --> 01:05:53,211
and a few friends
in town.

1030
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,340
O.K.

1031
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,416
I'll, uh...

1032
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:01,815
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

1033
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,323
Tell me, uh...

1034
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:05,986
are you frightened
for the girl

1035
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:09,030
or what Evelyn
might do to her?

1036
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:11,088
Just find the girl.

1037
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,667
I'll look into it

1038
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:17,535
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

1039
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:20,504
Orange groves?

1040
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:23,009
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Cross.

1041
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,350
I'm a little lost.
Could you tell me

1042
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,354
where the plat books for
the northwest valley are?

1043
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,856
Part of it's
in Ventura County.

1044
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,357
We don't have
Ventura County

1045
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,360
in our
Hall of Records.

1046
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:42,397
I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

1047
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:45,592
Row 23, Section "C."

1048
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:50,837
Weasel.

1049
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:47,818
Say, uh... sonny,

1050
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:48,954
uh...

1051
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:51,692
why do they have
all those names

1052
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:53,495
pasted in
the plat books?

1053
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:55,502
Land sales
out of escrow

1054
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,094
are recorded
within the week.

1055
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:59,606
Then these
are all new owners?

1056
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:00,663
That's right.

1057
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:03,643
Well, that means
most of the valley's sold

1058
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,646
in the last few months.

1059
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,648
If that's
what it says.

1060
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:11,618
Can I check one
of these volumes out?

1061
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:14,621
Sir, this is not
a lending library.

1062
01:08:14,689 --> 01:08:16,623
It's
the Hall of Records.

1063
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:18,716
Oh. How about
a ruler?

1064
01:08:18,793 --> 01:08:19,919
A ruler?

1065
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,929
Yeah.
The print's real fine.

1066
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,931
I left my glasses home.

1067
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,832
I'd like to be able
to read across.

1068
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:39,677
Why, thank you.

1069
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,690
[Coughs]

1070
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:44,570
[Gunshot]

1071
01:09:47,482 --> 01:09:49,416
Hold it right there!

1072
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:59,479
All right.
Quit it now!

1073
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:02,489
Search the man.
See if he's armed.

1074
01:11:15,203 --> 01:11:19,139
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

1075
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:20,765
Search him.
Search him.

1076
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,036
He ain't armed.

1077
01:11:24,112 --> 01:11:25,204
Who you with,

1078
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,544
the water department
or the real estate office?

1079
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,783
Get away from me!

1080
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,649
Come near me
with that again,

1081
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,654
you'll need
a pair of them.

1082
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,883
Pick on somebody
your own size.

1083
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:40,894
Cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

1084
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:44,731
The name's Gittes.

1085
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:46,164
I'm a private
investigator.

1086
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:49,169
I'm not with
either one of them.

1087
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:52,172
What you doing
out here, mister?

1088
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,004
A client hired me to see

1089
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:58,773
if the water department
was irrigating your land.

1090
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,212
Irrigating my land?

1091
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:02,215
The water department's
sending you people

1092
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:04,217
to blow up
my water tanks.

1093
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:07,254
They put poison
down three of my wells.

1094
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,291
Who'd hire you
for a thing like that?

1095
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:16,262
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

1096
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:18,765
Mulwray's the one
who's done it to us.

1097
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:19,891
Mulwray's dead.

1098
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,766
You don't know what
you're talking about,

1099
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:24,065
you dumb Okie.

1100
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:33,878
Well, uh, that's that.

1101
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:01,937
What's going on?

1102
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,944
You didn't look too good,

1103
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,708
so we thought we better
call your employer.

1104
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,521
Thanks for coming.

1105
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,660
That dam's a con job.

1106
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,820
What dam?

1107
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,659
The one
your husband opposed.

1108
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,824
They're conning L.A.
Into building it,

1109
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,595
but the water's
not going to L.A.

1110
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,101
It's coming right here.

1111
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,603
To the valley?

1112
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,605
Everything you see.
Everything around us.

1113
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,608
I was at the Hall
of Records today.

1114
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,183
In the last three months,

1115
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,185
Robert Knox
has bought 7,000 acres,

1116
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,686
Emma Dill, 12,000,

1117
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,881
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

1118
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,119
and Jasper Lamar Crabb,
25,000 acres.

1119
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,626
Jasper Lamar Crabb?

1120
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,127
You know him?

1121
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,130
I think I would've
remembered.

1122
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,133
Yeah. They're blowing
these farmers out of their land,

1123
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,135
then picking it up
for peanuts.

1124
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,639
You have any idea
what this land would be worth

1125
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,139
with a steady
water supply?

1126
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,644
About 30 million more
than they paid for it.

1127
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,145
Hollis knew
about this?

1128
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:14,148
That's why he was killed.

1129
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:18,213
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

1130
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,414
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

1131
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,081
We got it.

1132
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,090
What?

1133
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,592
We got it.

1134
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,650
What is it?

1135
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,162
"A memorial service
was held today

1136
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,528
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb.

1137
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,033
He passed away
two weeks ago."

1138
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,534
Well,
is that unusual?

1139
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,037
He passed away
two weeks ago,

1140
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,040
and one week ago
he bought the land.

1141
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,473
That's unusual.

1142
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,654
Hello.
I'm Mr. Palmer.

1143
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,656
Can I
help you folks?

1144
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,318
Yes, uh, I hope so.

1145
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,827
It's Dad, uh...

1146
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,831
I can't seem
to handle him anymore.

1147
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:37,991
My goodness.

1148
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,830
It's nothing with Dad.
It's, uh, it's me.

1149
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,837
Dad is
an absolute angel.

1150
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,703
It's just that
he and my hu...

1151
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:46,934
Oh, I don't know.

1152
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,876
I'm anxious for him
to have the best.

1153
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,378
Money is no object.

1154
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,381
Perhaps if we met
with your father...

1155
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:55,882
Uh... there
is one question.

1156
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,111
Of course.

1157
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,120
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

1158
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,622
I'm sorry,
but, uh, we don't.

1159
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,125
Don't be sorry.
Neither does Dad.

1160
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:08,128
We wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

1161
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:13,133
Would it be possible for me
to see a list of your patients?

1162
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,136
We never reveal
the names of our guests.

1163
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,637
You would
appreciate that

1164
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,230
if your father
came to live with us.

1165
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,970
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear you say.

1166
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,306
Good.

1167
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:26,245
Is it too late
for us to look around?

1168
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,146
No. Allow me
to show you.

1169
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:31,014
May we take a stroll
on our own?

1170
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,145
If you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

1171
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,813
It's almost bedtime.

1172
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:35,879
We understand.

1173
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,051
Come, my sweet.

1174
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,907
Charley, you ought
to know better than that.

1175
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,068
Sit down. Have a chair.

1176
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,087
They're all there.

1177
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,291
Every goddamn name.

1178
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:25,639
You're looking
at the owners

1179
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,641
of a 50,000-acre
empire.

1180
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,199
They can't be.

1181
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,772
They may
not know it,

1182
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,215
but they are.

1183
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:38,885
Hello, girls.

1184
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,387
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

1185
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,219
Are any of you
Emma Dill?

1186
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,223
Yes?

1187
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,657
Are you Emma?

1188
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:46,751
Yes.

1189
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,092
I've wanted to meet you
for a long time.

1190
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,461
Why?

1191
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,932
Did you know you
were a wealthy woman?

1192
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,298
Oh, I'm not.

1193
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,461
Yes, you are.

1194
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,937
You own
a lot of land.

1195
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:58,938
No more.

1196
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,440
Some time ago,

1197
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,945
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property

1198
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,445
at Long Beach,

1199
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,209
but we lost it.

1200
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,681
That's very beautiful.

1201
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,739
Thanks.

1202
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,719
Where did you get
this piece of material?

1203
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,221
At the Albacore Club.

1204
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,221
Abbacore?

1205
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,222
Uh, no.

1206
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,282
The Albacore.

1207
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,692
It's a fish.

1208
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,627
My grandson
is a member.

1209
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,893
They take very
nice care of us.

1210
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,900
How do they do that?

1211
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:28,401
Oh, give us things,

1212
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,405
not just like this
old flag, but...

1213
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:32,872
But what?

1214
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:37,037
We're an unofficial
charity of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

1215
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,046
Would you come
with me, please?

1216
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,548
Someone wants
to talk with you.

1217
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,118
Good-bye, ladies.

1218
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,586
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.

1219
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,964
I want you to meet
someone, Gittes.

1220
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,967
Can we leave the lady
out of this?

1221
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,468
Yeah. Why not?

1222
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,834
I'd like to see her
to the car.

1223
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,338
She knows
where it's at.

1224
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,669
I'll stay.

1225
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,175
Get in the car.

1226
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,789
Maid's night off?

1227
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:32,791
Why?

1228
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,794
What do you mean, why?

1229
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:36,295
Nobody's here,
that's why.

1230
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,798
I gave everyone
the night off.

1231
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:40,800
Easy. It's
an innocent question.

1232
01:20:40,868 --> 01:20:44,895
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

1233
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,565
I guess you're right.

1234
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:51,401
To you, Mrs. Mulwray.

1235
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:55,613
Frankly, tonight
you saved my as...

1236
01:20:55,683 --> 01:20:57,776
You saved my neck.

1237
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,553
Tell me, Mr. Gittes...

1238
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,485
does this often
happen to you?

1239
01:21:07,895 --> 01:21:08,827
What's that?

1240
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:11,160
I'm judging
only on the basis

1241
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:13,166
of one afternoon
and an evening,

1242
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:17,170
but if this is how
you go about your work,

1243
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:21,140
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a day.

1244
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,178
This hasn't happened
to me for a long time.

1245
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:26,179
When was
the last time?

1246
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:27,544
Why?

1247
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:30,743
It's an
innocent question.

1248
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,412
In Chinatown.

1249
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:38,857
What were
you doing there?

1250
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,529
Working for
the district attorney.

1251
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:43,723
Doing what?

1252
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:46,323
As little as possible.

1253
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:50,531
The district attorney
gives his men advice like that?

1254
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:52,402
They do in Chinatown.

1255
01:21:52,473 --> 01:21:56,409
Why did you leave
the police force?

1256
01:21:58,646 --> 01:21:59,578
Uh...

1257
01:21:59,647 --> 01:22:01,581
Do you have any, uh...

1258
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,674
peroxide, or, uh...

1259
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:05,685
anything like that?

1260
01:22:05,753 --> 01:22:06,685
Surely.

1261
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:08,688
Will you
come this way?

1262
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,437
My God!

1263
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:32,607
It's a nasty cut.

1264
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,115
I had no idea...

1265
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:41,988
Oh! Sorry!

1266
01:22:43,524 --> 01:22:45,355
There.

1267
01:22:45,426 --> 01:22:46,984
Is it painful?

1268
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,397
It must be painful.

1269
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:55,860
What's wrong?

1270
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,096
Your eye.

1271
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,670
What about it? What?

1272
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:07,441
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

1273
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,415
Oh, that.

1274
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,416
It's, uh...

1275
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,417
it's...

1276
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,386
a flaw...

1277
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:15,081
in the iris.

1278
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,748
A flaw?

1279
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:18,985
Yes, uh...

1280
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,051
it's a sort
of birthmark.

1281
01:23:56,797 --> 01:23:58,731
Did you wear
a uniform?

1282
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:01,930
Sometimes.

1283
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:06,166
Must have looked
cute in blue.

1284
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:11,209
Give me a break,
will ya?

1285
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,611
I don't know you.

1286
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:17,208
I want to know
more about you.

1287
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,217
Not now.

1288
01:24:20,154 --> 01:24:24,090
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

1289
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:28,619
I'm tired.

1290
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,632
No. Why does it bother
you to talk about it?

1291
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,134
It bothers everybody
that works there.

1292
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,261
Where?

1293
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:37,429
Chinatown.

1294
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,733
Everybody.

1295
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,832
To me, it was
just bad luck.

1296
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:43,842
Why?

1297
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,215
You can't always tell
what's going on.

1298
01:24:51,285 --> 01:24:52,775
Like with you.

1299
01:25:02,496 --> 01:25:03,986
Why was, um...

1300
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,226
why was it bad luck?

1301
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:14,232
I was trying
to keep someone

1302
01:25:14,308 --> 01:25:16,071
from being hurt.

1303
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:19,579
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1304
01:25:22,216 --> 01:25:23,945
Cherchez la femme.

1305
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:30,418
Was there
a woman involved?

1306
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,285

01:42:00,146 --> 01:42:02,080
I don't think
about it much.

1472
01:42:02,148 --> 01:42:03,581
Give me a few days.

1473
01:42:03,649 --> 01:42:05,082
I'll get
back to you.

1474
01:42:05,151 --> 01:42:06,584
I'd like to go home.

1475
01:42:06,652 --> 01:42:08,586
I want the other
pictures, Gittes.

1476
01:42:08,654 --> 01:42:10,144
What pictures?

1477
01:42:10,223 --> 01:42:12,748
This broad hired you,

1478
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:14,417
not Evelyn Mulwray.

1479
01:42:14,494 --> 01:42:15,426
Yeah?

1480
01:42:15,495 --> 01:42:16,587
Yeah.

1481
01:42:16,662 --> 01:42:18,926
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down.

1482
01:42:18,998 --> 01:42:20,260
She hired you.

1483
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:23,268
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1484
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:25,270
I heard
it was an accident.

1485
01:42:25,338 --> 01:42:26,600
Come on, Gittes.

1486
01:42:26,672 --> 01:42:29,607
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

1487
01:42:29,675 --> 01:42:32,576
Mulwray had salt water
in his lungs.

1488
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,914
You followed him
day and night.

1489
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:37,415
You saw who killed him.

1490
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:39,417
You even took pictures
of it.

1491
01:42:39,485 --> 01:42:40,747
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1492
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:43,414
and she's been
paying you off ever since.

1493
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:45,423
You accusing me
of extortion?

1494
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:46,515
Absolutely.

1495
01:42:46,592 --> 01:42:48,457
I don't need
a few days.

1496
01:42:48,528 --> 01:42:51,361
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1497
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,692
Not only that,

1498
01:42:52,765 --> 01:42:55,700
I wouldn't extort a nickel
from my worst enemy.

1499
01:42:55,768 --> 01:42:57,963
I want the rest
of the pictures.

1500
01:42:58,037 --> 01:43:00,301
We're talking about
accessory after the fact,

1501
01:43:00,373 --> 01:43:01,635
conspiracy,
and extortion, minimum.

1502
01:43:01,707 --> 01:43:02,969
What do you think,

1503
01:43:03,042 --> 01:43:05,476
Evelyn Mulwray
killed her husband in the ocean,

1504
01:43:05,545 --> 01:43:07,479
then dragged him
to the reservoir

1505
01:43:07,547 --> 01:43:09,981
to make it look more
like an accident?

1506
01:43:10,049 --> 01:43:11,482
Mulwray was murdered
and moved

1507
01:43:11,551 --> 01:43:15,855
because somebody
didn't want his body found in the ocean.

1508
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:16,955
Why is that?

1509
01:43:17,022 --> 01:43:19,149
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1510
01:43:19,225 --> 01:43:21,819
That's what they were
trying to cover up.

1511
01:43:21,894 --> 01:43:24,328
What the hell
are you talking about?

1512
01:43:24,396 --> 01:43:26,159
Come on.
I'll show you.

1513
01:43:27,233 --> 01:43:29,167
Come on, Lou.
You're in charge.

1514
01:43:29,235 --> 01:43:30,497
Make a decision.

1515
01:43:45,117 --> 01:43:46,482
Ha!

1516
01:43:48,354 --> 01:43:49,616
It's too late.

1517
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:50,950
Too late
for what?

1518
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:53,287
They only dump the water
at night.

1519
01:43:54,593 --> 01:43:55,787
Reach anybody?

1520
01:43:55,861 --> 01:43:57,920
Yelburton.
He's the new chief.

1521
01:43:57,997 --> 01:44:00,022
I know who he is.
Go on.

1522
01:44:00,099 --> 01:44:01,031
He says...

1523
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,533
I know what he says.

1524
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,533
Shut up.

1525
01:44:04,603 --> 01:44:05,729
Go on!

1526
01:44:05,804 --> 01:44:07,203
There's irrigation
in the valley,

1527
01:44:07,273 --> 01:44:09,207
and there's always
a little runoff

1528
01:44:09,275 --> 01:44:10,537
after they do that.

1529
01:44:10,609 --> 01:44:11,598
He says
Gittes knows this,

1530
01:44:11,677 --> 01:44:13,542
and he's been
going around

1531
01:44:13,612 --> 01:44:14,874
making irresponsible
accusations

1532
01:44:14,947 --> 01:44:16,209
all last week.

1533
01:44:16,282 --> 01:44:18,716
Let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

1534
01:44:18,784 --> 01:44:20,217
What are we waiting for?

1535
01:44:20,286 --> 01:44:21,548
He just
made lieutenant.

1536
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:25,056
Wants to hang on
to his little gold bar.

1537
01:44:28,127 --> 01:44:31,062
Have your client
in my office in two hours.

1538
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:33,894
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

1539
01:44:33,966 --> 01:44:35,399
I've got you
right now

1540
01:44:35,467 --> 01:44:36,729
for withholding
evidence.

1541
01:44:37,803 --> 01:44:38,895
Loach.

1542
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:26,384
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1543
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:30,213
These her bags?

1544
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:34,885
Is she going
on a trip?

1545
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,222
What are you doing?

1546
01:45:36,295 --> 01:45:37,728
What's
going on here?

1547
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:39,730
Is she going
on a vacation?

1548
01:45:39,798 --> 01:45:41,231
Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1549
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,393
Mrs. Mulwray
no home, huh?

1550
01:45:43,469 --> 01:45:46,336
Well, I'll just have
a look around, huh?

1551
01:45:52,745 --> 01:45:55,009
Yeah, Yeah.
Bad for the glass.

1552
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,174
Oh, yeah.
Bad for glass.

1553
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:00,844
Salt water
very bad for glass.

1554
01:46:15,934 --> 01:46:18,164
Salt water?

1555
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:20,171
Very, very bad.

1556
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,331
See?

1557
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:30,677
What's that?

1558
01:46:30,749 --> 01:46:31,841
Huh?

1559
01:46:32,918 --> 01:46:34,681
Right there.

1560
01:46:38,257 --> 01:46:39,519
There.

1561
01:46:41,093 --> 01:46:42,185
Huh.

1562
01:47:37,382 --> 01:47:38,314
You wait.

1563
01:47:38,383 --> 01:47:39,645
You wait.

1564
01:47:39,718 --> 01:47:41,811
Chow hoi tai dai.

1565
01:47:41,887 --> 01:47:44,321
[Speaking Chinese]

1566
01:47:44,389 --> 01:47:45,822
How are you?

1567
01:47:45,891 --> 01:47:48,291
I've been calling you.
It's all right.

1568
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,294
Have you...
have you slept?

1569
01:47:50,362 --> 01:47:51,795
Sure.

1570
01:47:51,864 --> 01:47:53,126
Have you had lunch?

1571
01:47:53,198 --> 01:47:54,631
Khan can fix you something.

1572
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,962
Where's the girl?

1573
01:47:56,034 --> 01:47:57,467
Upstairs. Why?

1574
01:47:57,536 --> 01:47:59,629
I want to see her.

1575
01:47:59,705 --> 01:48:01,969
She's having a bath
right now.

1576
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,304
Why do you
want to see her?

1577
01:48:04,376 --> 01:48:06,310
Going someplace?

1578
01:48:06,378 --> 01:48:09,870
Yes. We have
a 5:30 train to catch.

1579
01:48:12,918 --> 01:48:14,180
Jake.

1580
01:48:23,262 --> 01:48:27,528
J.J. Gittes
for Lieutenant Escobar.

1581
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:29,032
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

1582
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:31,365
I told you,
we have a 5:30...

1583
01:48:31,436 --> 01:48:33,597
You're going
to miss your train.

1584
01:48:35,274 --> 01:48:36,366
Lou?

1585
01:48:36,441 --> 01:48:40,036
Meet me at
1972 Canyon Drive.

1586
01:48:41,113 --> 01:48:44,048
Yeah.
As soon as you can.

1587
01:48:44,116 --> 01:48:46,050
Why did you do that?

1588
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:48,484
You know any good
criminal lawyers?

1589
01:48:48,554 --> 01:48:49,816
No.

1590
01:48:51,223 --> 01:48:54,158
Don't worry. I can
recommend a couple.

1591
01:48:54,226 --> 01:48:57,161
They're expensive,
but you can afford it.

1592
01:48:58,564 --> 01:49:02,500
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1593
01:49:13,212 --> 01:49:17,080
I found these in your
backyard in the pond.

1594
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:20,641
They belonged to your
husband, didn't they?

1595
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,619
Didn't they?

1596
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:25,020
I don't know.
Yes, probably.

1597
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:26,682
Yes, positively.

1598
01:49:26,758 --> 01:49:29,056
It's where he was drowned.

1599
01:49:29,127 --> 01:49:30,219
What?

1600
01:49:30,295 --> 01:49:33,355
There's no time to be
shocked by the truth.

1601
01:49:33,432 --> 01:49:34,592
The coroner's report

1602
01:49:34,666 --> 01:49:37,032
proves he had
salt water in his lungs

1603
01:49:37,102 --> 01:49:38,364
when he was killed.

1604
01:49:38,437 --> 01:49:40,701
I want to know
why it happened

1605
01:49:40,772 --> 01:49:42,034
before Escobar
gets here

1606
01:49:42,107 --> 01:49:44,439
because I don't want
to lose my license.

1607
01:49:44,509 --> 01:49:46,875
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1608
01:49:46,945 --> 01:49:49,209
This is the craziest,
most insane thing...

1609
01:49:49,281 --> 01:49:50,213
Stop it!

1610
01:49:50,282 --> 01:49:51,681
I'll make it easy.

1611
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:54,014
You were jealous.
You had a fight.

1612
01:49:54,086 --> 01:49:56,020
He fell.
He hit his head.

1613
01:49:56,088 --> 01:49:57,612
His girl is a witness.

1614
01:49:57,689 --> 01:49:59,452
You had to shut her up.

1615
01:49:59,524 --> 01:50:01,958
You got the money
to keep her quiet.

1616
01:50:02,027 --> 01:50:03,517
Yes or no?

1617
01:50:03,595 --> 01:50:04,527
No!

1618
01:50:04,596 --> 01:50:05,585
Who is she?

1619
01:50:05,664 --> 01:50:07,598
Don't tell me
she's your sister.

1620
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:09,827
You don't
have a sister.

1621
01:50:09,901 --> 01:50:10,925
I'll tell you.

1622
01:50:11,003 --> 01:50:13,130
I'll tell you
the truth.

1623
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:17,404
Good. What's her name?

1624
01:50:19,144 --> 01:50:20,406
Katherine.

1625
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:22,448
Katherine who?

1626
01:50:24,349 --> 01:50:26,146
She's my daughter.

1627
01:50:27,352 --> 01:50:29,320
I said
I want the truth!

1628
01:50:29,388 --> 01:50:31,322
She's my sister.

1629
01:50:32,558 --> 01:50:34,492
She's my daughter.

1630
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:38,155
My sister,
my daughter.

1631
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:40,323
I said I want the truth!

1632
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:41,832

02:00:56,381 --> 02:00:57,643
An obituary column.

1797
02:00:57,716 --> 02:01:00,150
Can you see all right
in this light?

1798
02:01:00,218 --> 02:01:02,152
I guess I can manage.

1799
02:01:11,229 --> 02:01:12,821
What does it mean?

1800
02:01:12,898 --> 02:01:15,332
That you killed
Hollis Mulwray...

1801
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:18,160
right here.

1802
02:01:18,236 --> 02:01:20,170
In that pond.

1803
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:21,830
You drowned him.

1804
02:01:23,074 --> 02:01:25,167
And you left these.

1805
02:01:27,245 --> 02:01:28,678
The coroner's report

1806
02:01:28,747 --> 02:01:31,682
shows Mulwray had
salt water in his lungs.

1807
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,512
Hollis was...

1808
02:01:36,588 --> 02:01:39,853
always fascinated
by tide pools.

1809
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:42,519
You know
what he used to say?

1810
02:01:42,594 --> 02:01:44,186
I haven't
the faintest idea.

1811
02:01:44,262 --> 02:01:45,854
That's where life begins...

1812
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:49,196
sloughs, tide pools.

1813
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:51,201
When we first come out here,

1814
02:01:51,269 --> 02:01:54,204
he figured if you dumped water
into the desert sand

1815
02:01:54,272 --> 02:01:57,036
and let it percolate
down to the bedrock,

1816
02:01:57,108 --> 02:01:58,370
it would stay there

1817
02:01:58,443 --> 02:02:01,378
instead of evaporate like
it does in most reservoirs.

1818
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:04,040
You'd only lose 20%
instead of 70 or 80.

1819
02:02:04,115 --> 02:02:07,050
That's what you were
going to do in the valley.

1820
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:08,551
It's what I am doing.

1821
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:10,554
When the bond issue
passes Tuesday,

1822
02:02:10,622 --> 02:02:11,884
there'll be $8 million

1823
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:14,221
to build an aqueduct
to the reservoir.

1824
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:15,554
There'll
be irate citizens

1825
02:02:15,627 --> 02:02:16,889
when they find out

1826
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:19,226
they're paying for water
they won't get.

1827
02:02:19,297 --> 02:02:20,730
That's
all taken care of.

1828
02:02:20,799 --> 02:02:22,232
See, Mr. Gitts,

1829
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:25,235
either you bring
the water to L.A.,

1830
02:02:25,303 --> 02:02:28,238
or you bring L.A.
To the water.

1831
02:02:28,306 --> 02:02:29,739
How will you do that?

1832
02:02:29,808 --> 02:02:32,072
By incorporating
the valley into the city.

1833
02:02:32,143 --> 02:02:33,405
Simple as that.

1834
02:02:34,813 --> 02:02:36,337
How much are you worth?

1835
02:02:36,414 --> 02:02:37,676
I have no idea.

1836
02:02:37,749 --> 02:02:39,182
How much
do you want?

1837
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,514
I just want to know
what you're worth.

1838
02:02:41,586 --> 02:02:42,848
Over 10 million?

1839
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:43,853
My, yes.

1840
02:02:43,922 --> 02:02:45,355
Why are you doing it?

1841
02:02:45,423 --> 02:02:48,358
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1842
02:02:48,426 --> 02:02:50,018
The future,
Mr. Gitts.

1843
02:02:50,095 --> 02:02:51,858
The future.

1844
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:53,864
Now where's
the girl?

1845
02:02:53,932 --> 02:02:56,366
I want the only daughter
I've got left.

1846
02:02:56,434 --> 02:02:57,696
As you found out,

1847
02:02:57,769 --> 02:03:00,704
Evelyn was lost to me
a long time ago.

1848
02:03:00,772 --> 02:03:03,036
Who do you blame
for that, her?

1849
02:03:03,108 --> 02:03:05,542
I don't blame myself.

1850
02:03:05,610 --> 02:03:07,043
See, Mr. Gitts,

1851
02:03:07,112 --> 02:03:10,047
most people never
have to face the fact...

1852
02:03:10,115 --> 02:03:12,549
at the right time
and the right place,

1853
02:03:12,617 --> 02:03:14,881
they're capable
of anything.

1854
02:03:16,287 --> 02:03:20,053
Claude, take those
glasses from him, will you?

1855
02:03:26,798 --> 02:03:29,062
It's not worth it,
Mr. Gitts.

1856
02:03:30,802 --> 02:03:33,566
It's really
not worth it.

1857
02:03:39,411 --> 02:03:41,380
Now take us
to the girl.

1858
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:37,829
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill,

1859
02:04:37,903 --> 02:04:39,165
don't you, boys?

1860
02:04:39,237 --> 02:04:41,171
Mr. Cross, these
are my associates,

1861
02:04:41,239 --> 02:04:42,672
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1862
02:04:43,909 --> 02:04:46,002
You're under arrest,
Jake.

1863
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:49,341
Good news.

1864
02:04:49,414 --> 02:04:52,008
Withholding evidence,
extortion,

1865
02:04:52,083 --> 02:04:53,516
accessory
after the fact.

1866
02:04:53,585 --> 02:04:55,519
I didn't extort nothing
from nobody.

1867
02:04:55,587 --> 02:04:58,021
This is Noah Cross,
if you don't know...

1868
02:04:58,089 --> 02:04:59,021
Evelyn's father.

1869
02:04:59,090 --> 02:05:00,523
He's the bird
you're after.

1870
02:05:00,592 --> 02:05:01,854
I can explain
everything...

1871
02:05:01,927 --> 02:05:02,859
Lieutenant.

1872
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:04,190
Give me five minutes.

1873
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:05,695
He's rich,
do you understand?

1874
02:05:05,764 --> 02:05:06,696
Shut up!

1875
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:08,699
Thinks he'll get away
with anything!

1876
02:05:08,767 --> 02:05:11,702
I'll lock you
into the wheel of that car.

1877
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:14,705
Lieutenant, I am rich.
I am Noah Cross.

1878
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:16,035
Evelyn Mulwray is my...

1879
02:05:16,107 --> 02:05:17,369
He's crazy, Lou!

1880
02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:19,876
He killed Mulwray
because of the water thing!

1881
02:05:19,945 --> 02:05:20,877
Water?

1882
02:05:20,946 --> 02:05:22,880
Listen to me
for five minutes!

1883
02:05:22,948 --> 02:05:25,382
Lock him to the wheel
of that car.

1884
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:28,419
Lou, you don't know
what's going on.

1885
02:05:28,487 --> 02:05:29,715
Katherine.

1886
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:30,880
Katherine.

1887
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:34,551
L... l... I am
your grandfather.

1888
02:05:34,626 --> 02:05:35,558
Come, miss.

1889
02:05:35,627 --> 02:05:37,652
My dear, I'm
your grandfather.

1890
02:05:37,729 --> 02:05:39,321
Katherine,
get in the car.

1891
02:05:39,397 --> 02:05:40,659
Go on, go on.

1892
02:05:40,732 --> 02:05:41,664
But...

1893
02:05:41,733 --> 02:05:43,166
No, no. Just go on.

1894
02:05:43,235 --> 02:05:44,167
I'll follow.

1895
02:05:45,237 --> 02:05:46,670
Get away from her.

1896
02:05:46,738 --> 02:05:47,670
Get away!

1897
02:05:47,739 --> 02:05:48,671
Evelyn.

1898
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:52,005
Please, please
be reasonable.

1899
02:05:52,077 --> 02:05:53,339
Come to my...

1900
02:05:53,411 --> 02:05:54,844
Get away from her!

1901
02:05:54,913 --> 02:05:56,005
Evelyn!

1902
02:05:57,415 --> 02:06:00,179
How many years
have I got?

1903
02:06:00,252 --> 02:06:02,345
She's mine, too.

1904
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:05,014
She's never
going to know that!

1905
02:06:07,125 --> 02:06:09,389
Evelyn, you're
a disturbed woman.

1906
02:06:09,461 --> 02:06:11,395
You cannot hope
to provide...

1907
02:06:11,463 --> 02:06:13,090
Evelyn, put
that gun away!

1908
02:06:13,164 --> 02:06:14,426
Let the police
handle this!

1909
02:06:14,499 --> 02:06:16,763
He owns the police!

1910
02:06:16,835 --> 02:06:18,427
Get away from her.

1911
02:06:18,503 --> 02:06:20,437
You'll have
to kill me first.

1912
02:06:20,505 --> 02:06:21,767
Get away! Get...

1913
02:06:22,841 --> 02:06:24,365
Katherine,
close the door.

1914
02:06:25,977 --> 02:06:27,205
Halt!

1915
02:06:35,687 --> 02:06:39,555
[Honk]

1916
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:55,899
Aah!

1917
02:06:55,974 --> 02:06:58,067
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

1918
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:01,078
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

1919
02:07:01,146 --> 02:07:03,740
Aah!

1920
02:07:03,815 --> 02:07:06,750
Aah! Oh!

1921
02:07:06,818 --> 02:07:08,911
Oh, no!

1922
02:07:08,987 --> 02:07:11,421
Call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1923
02:07:11,489 --> 02:07:12,421
No!

1924
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:14,924
Turn him loose.
Turn them all loose.

1925
02:07:14,993 --> 02:07:18,759
Oh, no! Ohh!

1926
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:20,923
Lord.

1927
02:07:20,999 --> 02:07:21,931
Aah!

1928
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,932
Oh, Lord.

1929
02:07:23,001 --> 02:07:25,595
Oh, no, no!

1930
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:26,762
Aah! Aah!

1931
02:07:26,838 --> 02:07:28,271
No! No!

1932
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,272
Don't look.

1933
02:07:29,341 --> 02:07:30,433
Don't look.

1934
02:07:30,508 --> 02:07:31,600
Oh, no!

1935
02:07:31,676 --> 02:07:34,110
No! No!

1936
02:07:34,179 --> 02:07:36,044
No! Oh...

1937
02:07:36,114 --> 02:07:38,548
Oh, no...

1938
02:07:43,288 --> 02:07:45,347
As little as possible.

1939
02:07:45,423 --> 02:07:46,515
What's that?

1940
02:07:49,094 --> 02:07:50,527
What's that?

1941
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,035
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1942
02:07:59,771 --> 02:08:01,534
Take him home.

1943
02:08:04,776 --> 02:08:06,869
Take him home!

1944
02:08:06,945 --> 02:08:09,539
Just get him
the hell out of here!

1945
02:08:09,614 --> 02:08:10,876
Come on, Jake.

1946
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:13,383
Go home, Jake.

1947
02:08:14,619 --> 02:08:16,712
I'm doing you a favor.

1948
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:19,548
Come on, Jake.

1949
02:08:22,627 --> 02:08:25,892
Forget it, Jake.
It's Chinatown.

1950
02:08:39,911 --> 02:08:42,846
All right. Come on.
Clear the area!

1951
02:08:42,914 --> 02:08:44,506
On the sidewalk!

1952
02:08:45,917 --> 02:08:48,010
On the sidewalk!

1953
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:51,685
Get off the street!

1954
02:08:53,758 --> 02:08:56,022
Get off the street!

1955
02:10:29,758 --> 02:10:30,022
{{{the end}}}
