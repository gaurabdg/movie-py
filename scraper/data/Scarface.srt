00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:49,855
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

610
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,163
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

611
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:02,467
You're looking very pretty
today. Yes, you. l've been
watching you from over there.

612
00:46:02,546 --> 00:46:06,482
You wanna see something funny? Hey,
take a look over there. See that man?

613
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,984
Watch that guy.
l gotta sit down here.

614
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:13,352
l gotta watch my friend. He gonna
stick his tongue out to that girl.

615
00:46:13,423 --> 00:46:16,722
- Look at that. ¡Ay, coño!
- You're sick!

616
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:19,887
You see what happened to him? Hey!

617
00:46:19,963 --> 00:46:23,626
- You know, if l wasn't
a nice guy, l'd crack you.
- She's too big for you.

618
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,191
- Causing trouble like that. Come on.
- Bitch!

619
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:28,203
- What l try to tell you?
- Lesbian!

620
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:32,503
What l try to tell you? This country,
you gotta make the money first.

621
00:46:33,743 --> 00:46:36,712
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

622
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,443
Then when you get the power,
then you get the woman.

623
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:42,815
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

624
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:45,116
That's the one l rented.

625
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:48,248
No, no, no. They-- They--
That's her, man. There she is.

626
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,520
- Oh, oh, oh.
- 'Bout time.

627
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:55,720
Frank got held up at the golf course.
He told me to pick you up.

628
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:59,030
Uh, he said he'd meet us
at the track later.

629
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,534
He said to bet on lce Cream
in the first, by the way.

630
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:10,169
ln that thing?
You must be kidding.

631
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:15,115
What you talkin' about?
That's a Cadillac.

632
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,919
- l wouldn't be
caught dead in that thing.
- Aw, come on.

633
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,118
Hey, you know, l mean,
it's got a few years.

634
00:47:23,193 --> 00:47:25,525
- [Chuckles]
- But it's a cream puff.

635
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:28,462
lt looks like
somebody's nightmare.

636
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:40,842
So, you like this better?

637
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,878
Yeah.

638
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:47,747
- lt like one of them tigers
from lndia, huh?
- Tigers, no?

639
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:49,842
Crazy guy.
You know what he's been doin'?

640
00:47:49,919 --> 00:47:52,888
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

641
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:57,154
He says he's gonna buy one now.
You do that, and you're not
gonna have any friends left.

642
00:47:57,227 --> 00:47:59,991
- Not that you have any now--
- You're gonna like that tiger, man.

643
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:03,123
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

644
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,134
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

645
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,066
- How much?
- 43,000, fully equipped.

646
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:15,839
- That all?
- Machine gun turrets are extra.

647
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:19,404
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

648
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:26,087
Bullet-proof this, okay?
And this here and here.

649
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,953
- [Manny] Okay.
- And the windows.

650
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:30,219
Okay.

651
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:35,026
- And get me one of them phones,
you know, with a scrambler.
- And a scrambler.

652
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:39,194
And a radio with scanners, to pick out
flying saucers, stuff like that.

653
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:42,033
- Don't forget the fog lights.
- Oh!

654
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:46,041
ln case l get caught in the swamp.
That's a good idea.

655
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:48,600
[Horn Blaring]

656
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:51,647
Get out of the way, lady!
l'm tryin' to drive here!

657
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:54,616
l thought you were
taking me to Frank.

658
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,554
We got an hour.
You hungry?

659
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,895
No, but l'm bored.

660
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:09,989
Well, that figures.

661
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:15,204
- Hey, check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
- Yeah.

662
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:18,832
And, uh, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

663
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:21,604
- Good doin' business with you.
- Mr. Montana.

664
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,612
Oh, God!

665
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:28,283
l wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

666
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:31,149
Plannin' on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

667
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,712
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

668
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,085
And what would Frank say?

669
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:41,926
l like Frank, you know?

670
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,432
Only l like you better.

671
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,061
[Snorting]

672
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,906
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

673
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,684
- [Tapping]
- Okay.

674
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,913
[Snorting]

675
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,258
- [Mutters]
- Okay.

676
00:50:11,995 --> 00:50:16,796
Don't get confused, Tony.
l don't fuck around with the help.

677
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,539
Okay.

678
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:28,270
You wanna play that way with me,
l play with you.

679
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,278
Shit.

680
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:33,577
- Would you kiss me if l wear the hat?
- No!

681
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,147
Playtime is over, okay?
[Laughing]

682
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,980
Okay.

683
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:23,791
[Knocking]

684
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,806
Mamá.

685
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,644
Antonio.

686
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,650
Long time.

687
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:45,487
No postcards from jail?

688
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,866
¡Coño! Gina.

689
00:51:58,568 --> 00:51:59,967
[Gasps]
Tony?

690
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,904
- Oh, man, look at you. [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

691
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:06,134
Hey, you're beautiful.

692
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,973
- l didn't--
- Mamá, look at those eyes, huh?

693
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:12,208
- Look at that. She looks like me.
- [Chuckles]

694
00:52:12,282 --> 00:52:15,251
You know the last time l saw you,
you was like that.

695
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:17,479
You looked like a little boy.

696
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:20,044
But now look at you.

697
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:24,783
Uh, l got something for you.

698
00:52:25,862 --> 00:52:28,524
[Exhales Deeply]

699
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:31,123
For you.
This no big deal.

700
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:36,396
Oh, Tony!
[Crying]

701
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,237
- [Laughs]
- Oooh, Tony!

702
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:48,784
l never thought
l'd see you again, you know?

703
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,251
You think they're gonna keep
a guy like me down?

704
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:53,812
Well, no.
[Laughs] No.

705
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,253
[Sighs]
You look so good.

706
00:52:58,328 --> 00:53:02,424
Look. You open that up.
Open it.

707
00:53:02,498 --> 00:53:04,762
- For me?
- l think so.

708
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:09,630
lt's nothing much,
you know. Nothing.

709
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:13,301
- [Sighs]
- See?

710
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:15,310
Do you see what's written
on the back?

711
00:53:15,378 --> 00:53:19,109
On the back?
[Sighs]

712
00:53:19,182 --> 00:53:23,118
- ''Always.''
- ''Always.'' lt's beautiful, Tony!

713
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:27,019
So Mamá is still working
in the factory,

714
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,354
and l'm working part-time
in a beauty parlor.

715
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,292
l'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram González?

716
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:35,160
His father owned that barbershop.
lt's his place.

717
00:53:35,231 --> 00:53:37,893
Plus l go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

718
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:41,130
And in two more years,
l get my cosmetology license.

719
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:44,970
- And then l'll be making enough money--
- Surprise!

720
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:48,636
All that's over...
starting today.

721
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:53,239
- Why?
- My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor,

722
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:57,377
and Mamá, she don't have to sew
in no factory.

723
00:53:57,453 --> 00:53:59,819
Your son made it, Mamá.

724
00:54:00,823 --> 00:54:03,257
He's a success.

725
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:06,625
That's why l didn't
come around before.

726
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:11,099
l want you to see
what a good boy l been.

727
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,231
Here's a thousand dollars.

728
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:17,829
For you, Mamá.

729
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:19,841
[Clears Throat]

730
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,378
- Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
- Mamá.

731
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,283
l didn't kill nobody, Mamá.

732
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:32,651
- No?
- No.

733
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:35,122
What are you doing now?

734
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,319
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

735
00:54:38,394 --> 00:54:40,794
No! Things are different now.

736
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:43,923
l'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

737
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,198
l'm an organizer now, and l get
a lot of political contributions.

738
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:50,535
Sure you do.

739
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:58,408
A gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.

740
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:04,209
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

741
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:08,747
is animals like you
and the killings.

742
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:11,726
lt's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

743
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:15,161
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

744
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:17,927
- People who send
their children to school--
- Mamá! What are you saying?

745
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,525
- That's your son!
- [Shouts] Son?

746
00:55:20,603 --> 00:55:23,800
- l wish l had one. He's a bum.
- No. No.

747
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:27,309
He was a bum then,
and he's a bum now.

748
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:33,077
Who do you think
you are, hmm?

749
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:36,550
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

750
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:39,144
Cinco años.

751
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:42,157
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

752
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:44,921
and think you can get
my respect.

753
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:47,986
-You think you can buy me with jewelry?
-Come on, Mamá.

754
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:51,397
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

755
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:53,765
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

756
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:58,273
- Mamá, you don't know
what you're talking about.
- That's not the way l am!

757
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:02,801
That is not the way
l raised Gina to be!

758
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:07,043
You are not going
to destroy her.

759
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:10,950
l don't need your money.

00:56:13,422 --> 00:56:16,357
l don't want you
in this house anymore!

762
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:19,360
l don't want you around Gina.

763
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:22,090
So, come on. Get out!

764
00:56:27,336 --> 00:56:29,600
Okay.

765
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:36,377
- No. Mamá--
- And take this lousy money with you.

766
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,936
- lt stinks.
- Tony--

767
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:44,117
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?

768
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:49,387
l'm sorry, Tony.

769
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,892
Okay, Mamá.

770
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,921
Oh, no, no.
Tony, wait a minute!

771
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,126
- Don't go, please!
- Gina, stay here!

772
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:02,602
- [Gina] No, no, no, Mamá--
- [Mamá] He's no good. Gina!

773
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,106
- Tony, wait, please!
- Gina!

774
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:09,543
l'm sorry. l don't know, Mamá--
Ever since Papá left she's--

775
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:12,376
Forget Papá.
We never had one.

776
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,178
l know you did
some bad things back then.

777
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:18,118
ln the army, l know
you got into some trouble.

778
00:57:18,187 --> 00:57:20,917
The Communists, they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

779
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,050
- Mamá doesn't understand that.
- l know.

780
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:30,896
l just-- l don't know. l just want you
to know, you know, l don't care.

781
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:35,267
lt doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.

782
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:40,807
You're my blood, always.

783
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:44,444
l know. l know.

784
00:57:53,623 --> 00:57:56,956
- Come on. Come on.
l want you to take this.
- l gotta go back in.

785
00:57:57,026 --> 00:57:59,688
- No, Tony. Please. Tony.
- You need this. Come on.

786
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:03,163
- What am l gonna tell her?
- Take that. You don't
tell her anything.

787
00:58:03,232 --> 00:58:06,497
Don't tell her l give it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

788
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,333
And listen, you go out yourself,
you know?

789
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:12,897
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

790
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:15,409
You gotta get some fun
out of life.

791
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:20,279
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you?

792
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:22,681
- Come here.
- Mmm.

793
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:26,683
- l'll talk to you again, all right?
- Okay.

794
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:30,385
- Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
- l'll talk to her.

795
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:33,257
- Okay. l'll talk to you.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]

796
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:35,593
Okay.

797
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:38,429
Okay, let's go.

798
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:40,435
She's beautiful.

799
00:58:40,503 --> 00:58:43,336
- How come you--
- Hey!

800
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:48,002
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?

801
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:51,774
- She not for you.
- Okay.

802
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,572
So this and my other factory,
l can guarantee production...

803
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:24,773
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

804
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:27,042
The problem is
l have no steady market.

805
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:30,574
Basically, what l'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

806
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:33,315
who can share the risk with me,

807
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:38,417
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.

808
00:59:38,494 --> 00:59:41,725
Oh! That's a big commitment,
Mr. Sosa.

809
00:59:41,797 --> 00:59:44,061
Something like that, uh--

810
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:47,068
lt's too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

811
00:59:47,136 --> 00:59:50,333
- lt would've been nice
if he could have come.
- He would like to come,

812
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:54,342
but with his trial coming up, it's hard
for him to get out of the country.

813
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,039
- So he sent you instead?
- Yeah, something like that.

814
00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:00,844
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

815
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:04,317
You got good stuff here.
Class 'A' shit.

816
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:31,177
So this López guarantees to buy from me
150 kilos every month of the year.

817
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:33,306
He picks it up here.

818
01:00:33,382 --> 01:00:38,149
l can sell it to him for as little as,
uh... 7,000 a key.

819
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,121
You cannot do better than that.

820
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,591
Yeah, but then we gotta
take the risk of moving it.

821
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,493
Also, we'll be cutting out the
Colombians. You know what that means?

822
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:49,554
That means we have
to go to war with them.

823
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:52,897
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

824
01:00:52,968 --> 01:00:56,460
Why don't we split the risk?

825
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:00,839
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama.

826
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,572
We take it from there.

827
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:07,073
Panama is risky.

828
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:09,947
lt costs me more.

829
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,749
Panama l can sell for...

830
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:14,756
13.5 a key.

831
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:17,759
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

832
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:23,428
13.5? We still gotta take
that shit to Florida, man.

833
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:27,799
Do you know what that's like
these days? You got the fucking navy.

834
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:32,637
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

835
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,973
You got the fucking
Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.

836
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:39,139
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

837
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:42,810
That's no duck walk anymore, man,
let me tell you.

838
01:01:42,885 --> 01:01:44,944
Forget about 13.5.

839
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:48,079
- [Phone Ringing]
- Well,

840
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:50,717
what do you suggest
that is reasonable?

841
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,023
[Ringing Continues]

842
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:58,062
Excuse me one moment.

843
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:05,599
Hey, Montana, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

844
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:08,268
- You negotiating for Frank López, huh?
- Don't worry about it.

845
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:11,472
- Take it easy.
- l'm not worried about it.

846
01:02:11,547 --> 01:02:15,142
You should worry about it. lf he wants
to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.

847
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:18,778
- We're gonna do
this one deal. That's it.
- Fuck you. How's that?

848
01:02:20,556 --> 01:02:22,524
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

849
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,458
[Omar] You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

850
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:28,725
- That's it. Let it go at that.
- Don't worry about it.

851
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:31,425
Your head is in the wrong place.
You got to watch out for yourself.

852
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,901
Why don't you talk to him
about it? You think he
wants to give you the money?

853
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:39,600
- Shut the fuck up.
- l'm doing the talking here, not you.

854
01:02:39,675 --> 01:02:43,702
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

855
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:47,180
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.

856
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,183
[Omar]
Close your mouth.

857
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:52,948
l can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

858
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:56,822
Just shut up.
l'm doing the talking here.

859
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:59,326
- Now where were we?
- Panama.

860
01:02:59,395 --> 01:03:01,829
You're looking
for a partner, right?

861
01:03:02,932 --> 01:03:04,866
Something like that.

862
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:09,132
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

863
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:13,573
l am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

864
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:16,076
That's my limit.
l got no right--

865
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:19,273
- Nobody got no right
to negotiate for Frank--
- Let the man finish, okay?

866
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:22,317
Let him propose a proposition;
then we can talk more.

867
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:24,409
You got no authority here.

868
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,216
l started you in this fucking business,
so shut the fuck up.

869
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:30,986
- Frank is gonna love it.
Don't worry about it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

870
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:36,488
l'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

871
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:39,090
No, it is all right.

872
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:42,626
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

873
01:03:45,274 --> 01:03:47,640
Well, good.

874
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,009
l don't think it's something
l wanna do on an overseas phone.

875
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:56,177
But as soon as l get back to Miami,
l will talk to Frank personally.

876
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,583
Good.

to Santa Cruz.

Good talking to you.

885
01:04:18,674 --> 01:04:21,268
Why don't you leave
your friend here?

886
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:24,107
While you are gone, maybe he can
tell me how to run my business.

887
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:26,977
- l think Frank would like to see him--
- No, that's okay.

888
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:30,348
You tell Frank l keeping

Let's finish our lunch.

892
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,901
l have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

893
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,030
You got everything
a man could want.

l like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

about the rest of your organization.

What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

898
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,923
l'm talking about Omar Suárez.

899
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:16,354
- This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...
- [Helicopter Whirring]

900
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:20,698
from several years ago
in New York.

He was an informer
for the police.

[Omar Screaming]

903
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:46,493
[Sosa] He put Vito Duval
and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino,

904
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,395
away for life.

So how do l know you're not
a chivato too, Tony?

Hey, Sosa.

01:50:45,944 --> 01:50:49,311
Could be the Díaz brothers,
come to get me.

1509
01:50:51,082 --> 01:50:53,607
Maybe.
l'll check it out, okay?

1510
01:50:53,685 --> 01:50:57,781
You check it out. Then we're gonna blow
that fuckin' truck back to Colombia!

1511
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:01,181
Come on, come on.
Monina.

1512
01:51:01,259 --> 01:51:04,524
We're not the only dopers living
on the block, okay? Remember that.

1513
01:51:04,596 --> 01:51:08,532
That fucking truck, that
could be anybody and anything.
lt could be a cable company--

1514
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,592
You know something?
You got some fuckin' attitude.

1515
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:14,137
For someone who's in charge
of my security--

1516
01:51:14,205 --> 01:51:19,142
Here. Here are the keys to
the front door. Go down there.
Give 'em the fuckin' keys!

1517
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,235
- l'm just tryin' to say something.
- What?

1518
01:51:21,312 --> 01:51:25,442
- You're spending a lot of money
on this countersurveillance.
- l don't give a fuck.

1519
01:51:25,517 --> 01:51:29,647
lt's already twelve percent
of our adjusted gross.
Twelve percent is not peanuts.

1520
01:51:29,721 --> 01:51:33,714
l don't give a fuck! lt makes me sleep
good at night. That's what counts.

1521
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:36,192
- Okay? You worry about it.
- l am worried about it.

1522
01:51:36,261 --> 01:51:39,424
l'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1523
01:51:39,497 --> 01:51:43,092
Our thinking,
our fuckin' attitude, you know?

1524
01:51:43,168 --> 01:51:45,159
We're not fuckin' hungry anymore.

1525
01:51:45,236 --> 01:51:45,270
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1526
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:47,966
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1527
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,973
New construction.
New jobs.

1528
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:52,908
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.

1529
01:51:52,977 --> 01:51:57,812
We've been putting your money
to work for 75 years building
a more prosperous Miami.

1530
01:51:57,882 --> 01:52:00,282
- Count on us being here tomorrow.
- [Tony] Oh, yeah?

1531
01:52:00,351 --> 01:52:03,252
That's because for 75 years
you been fuckin' everybody.

1532
01:52:03,321 --> 01:52:06,984
Somebody should do something
about these-- these whores.

1533
01:52:07,058 --> 01:52:09,322
l mean, chargin' me
ten points on my money.

1534
01:52:09,394 --> 01:52:14,229
They're gettin' away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1535
01:52:14,299 --> 01:52:16,233
- Forget it, man.
- l mean, anything goes.

1536
01:52:16,301 --> 01:52:20,362
They been around a thousand years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1537
01:52:20,438 --> 01:52:23,874
You know what capitalism is?
Gettin' fucked.

1538
01:52:23,942 --> 01:52:26,137
[Elvira]
True capitalist if ever l met one.

1539
01:52:26,211 --> 01:52:30,147
- [TV Shuts Off]
- Uh-oh. Did you hear that?

1540
01:52:30,215 --> 01:52:32,206
How would you know, bubblehead?

1541
01:52:32,283 --> 01:52:37,311
You ever do nothin' besides get
your hair fixed and powder your nose?

1542
01:52:37,388 --> 01:52:40,084
Look at it. You do too much
of that shit, you know?

1543
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:42,626
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1544
01:52:42,694 --> 01:52:46,357
- You should know that, Tony.
- l should know what?

1545
01:52:46,431 --> 01:52:48,797
What should l know?

1546
01:52:48,867 --> 01:52:52,030
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time for?

1547
01:52:52,103 --> 01:52:55,231
- Like l gotta know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1548
01:52:55,306 --> 01:52:58,764
- Listen to me.
This Seidelbaum. Five to 7:00.
- What time is it?

1549
01:52:58,843 --> 01:53:01,676
- Okay.
- Okay?

1550
01:53:01,746 --> 01:53:05,079
- l met with this guy--
- The drug-related violence
that's plagued south Florida...

1551
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:07,117
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1552
01:53:07,185 --> 01:53:09,551
forces one to ask a question:

1553
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:12,647
How, with a small law enforcement
budget, can you put a dent...

1554
01:53:12,724 --> 01:53:17,718
on an estimated
$100 billion-a-year business?

1555
01:53:17,795 --> 01:53:21,060
lt seems at times all you can do
is put your finger in the dike and pray.

1556
01:53:21,132 --> 01:53:23,464
Put your fingers in a dike?

1557
01:53:23,534 --> 01:53:28,062
The only place you can
get your fingers in some dyke.

1558
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:33,668
Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.

1559
01:53:33,745 --> 01:53:39,308
These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.

1560
01:53:39,384 --> 01:53:41,511
l am not one of those voices.

1561
01:53:41,586 --> 01:53:43,577
l know that.
But you know why, Vic?

1562
01:53:43,655 --> 01:53:46,590
'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.

1563
01:53:46,658 --> 01:53:48,683
That fuckin' guy,
he never tells the truth.

1564
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:52,423
...splendor of our city
at its best.

1565
01:53:52,497 --> 01:53:55,955
lt's those guys, man!
lt's the fuckin' bankers,
the politicians--

1566
01:53:56,034 --> 01:53:57,968
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1567
01:53:58,036 --> 01:54:01,665
So they can make the fuckin' money,
and they get the fuckin' votes!

1568
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:05,334
They fightin' the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1569
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:07,344
They fuck anything and anyone--

1570
01:54:07,412 --> 01:54:10,677
Can't you stop saying ''fuck''
all the time?

1571
01:54:10,748 --> 01:54:13,683
Can't you stop talking about money?
lt's boring, Tony.

1572
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:17,380
Where's this comin' from, man?
Boring? What's boring?

1573
01:54:17,455 --> 01:54:19,389
- You're boring.
- Oh.

1574
01:54:19,457 --> 01:54:23,120
Money, money, money, money, money.
That's all l ever hear in this house.

1575
01:54:23,194 --> 01:54:26,288
Manny, look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!

1576
01:54:26,364 --> 01:54:29,026
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1577
01:54:30,601 --> 01:54:33,263
Oh.

1578
01:54:33,338 --> 01:54:36,671
That's 'cause
he was so smart, you know?

1579
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,675
[Tony Muttering]

1580
01:54:38,743 --> 01:54:41,837
Cuidado. Se te cae.

1581
01:54:41,913 --> 01:54:44,677
You know what
you're becoming, Tony?

1582
01:54:44,749 --> 01:54:47,081
You're an immigrant
spic millionaire...

1583
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:49,085
who can't stop talking about
how much money he's got--

1584
01:54:49,153 --> 01:54:51,485
Who you callin' a spic,
you white piece of bread?

1585
01:54:51,556 --> 01:54:53,751
Get out of the way
of the television!

1586
01:54:53,825 --> 01:54:56,623
Why don't you dig a hole
in the garden and bury it?

1587
01:54:56,694 --> 01:55:00,095
l work hard for this!
l want you to know that.

1588
01:55:02,967 --> 01:55:07,028
lt's too bad.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1589
01:55:07,105 --> 01:55:11,769
Oh. You know what
your problem is, pussycat?

1590
01:55:11,843 --> 01:55:14,073
What is my problem?

1591
01:55:14,145 --> 01:55:17,581
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1592
01:55:17,648 --> 01:55:20,776
Why don't you get a job
or something, you know?

1593
01:55:20,852 --> 01:55:23,753
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1594
01:55:23,821 --> 01:55:27,188
Work with blind kids, lepers.

1595
01:55:27,258 --> 01:55:31,627
Anything beats lying around all day
waitin' for me to fuck you!

1596
01:55:31,696 --> 01:55:34,688
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1597
01:55:34,766 --> 01:55:36,893
Oh, no?
Frank was better, huh?

1598
01:55:38,469 --> 01:55:40,903
You're an asshole!

Where you going?
Come here!

1600

l was only kidding!

1602
01:55:51,015 --> 01:55:55,247
l guess sometimes married life is not
all it's cracked up to be, you know?

1603
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:58,413
- Where you goin'?
- l got a date.

1604
01:55:58,489 --> 01:56:00,423

Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it. l take care of it.

1609
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,705
''Stay out of it''?
lt's my deal. l set it up.

1610
01:56:18,776 --> 01:56:21,142
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1611
01:56:21,212 --> 01:56:24,147
You like the ladies more than you like
the money. That's your problem.

1612
01:56:24,215 --> 01:56:27,742
What the fuck are you talking about?
l'm your partner, okay?

You're not gonna trust me with that
kind of thing, who you gonna trust?

1614

- Junior partner.

Hey, don't talk to me about trust.
l don't like it.

1616
01:56:38,663 --> 01:56:43,191
You should listen to your wife.
She's right. You are an asshole, man!

1617
01:56:43,267 --> 01:56:46,031
Come here. Gimme a kiss.

With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

l've heard whispers about financial
support your government receives...

from the drug industry
in Bolivia.

1740

Well, the irony of this is that
this money, which is in the billions,

is coming from your country.

of our national product,

which is cocaine.

1744

On one hand you're saying
the United States government...

1745
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:59,857
is spending millions of dollars
to eliminate the flow of drugs
onto our streets.

1746
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:04,264
At the same time, we are doing business
with the same government...

that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.

a few of the other characters...

that are involved
in this tragicomedy.

My organization just recently
traced a large purchase...

1751
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,773
by this man.

1752
02:05:18,849 --> 02:05:22,012
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.

1753
02:05:22,086 --> 02:05:26,318
He is the minister of the defense
of Bolivia, my country.

1754
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:29,052
And General Cucombre just
a couple of months ago...

1755
02:05:29,126 --> 02:05:33,654
bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1756
02:05:33,731 --> 02:05:36,859
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian defense minister,

1757
02:05:36,934 --> 02:05:40,233
what is he doing living in Switzerland,
guarding cash registers?

He's a wealthy landowner,
educated in England, very good family.

across the Andes.
