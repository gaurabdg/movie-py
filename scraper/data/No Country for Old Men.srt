916
01:45:12,454 --> 01:45:16,074
If I was Him, I'd have the same
opinion of me that He does.

917
01:45:16,175 --> 01:45:17,992
You don't know what He thinks.

918
01:45:31,974 --> 01:45:35,743
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster
and badge over to the Rangers,

919
01:45:35,844 --> 01:45:38,246
put it in their museum.

920
01:45:38,347 --> 01:45:43,150
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

921
01:45:43,252 --> 01:45:46,987
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

922
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:53,895
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

923
01:45:53,996 --> 01:45:56,898
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

924
01:45:56,999 --> 01:46:00,668
Well, they was ahead of him.

925
01:46:00,769 --> 01:46:03,337
Shot him in his doorway.

926
01:46:03,389 --> 01:46:06,057
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

927
01:46:06,308 --> 01:46:09,911
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

928
01:46:10,062 --> 01:46:15,299
They just sat there on their
horses, watching him die.

929
01:46:15,317 --> 01:46:20,071
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

930
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,791
Left out.

931
01:46:24,593 --> 01:46:28,213
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

932
01:46:28,314 --> 01:46:31,332
Shot through the left lung.

933
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:36,270
And that was that...
as they say.

934
01:46:39,374 --> 01:46:41,092
When'd he die?

935
01:46:42,027 --> 01:46:45,379
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

936
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:49,150
No, I mean, was it right away
or in the night or...

937
01:46:49,267 --> 01:46:52,904
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

938
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:58,242
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

939
01:47:01,062 --> 01:47:03,948
What you got ain't nothin' new.

940
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,852
This country is hard on people.

941
01:47:11,373 --> 01:47:13,657
You can't stop what's coming.

942
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,661
It ain't all waitin' on you.

943
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:22,233
That's vanity.

944
01:48:22,995 --> 01:48:25,546
I knew this wasn't done with.

945
01:48:28,233 --> 01:48:30,267
I ain't got the money.

946
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:36,541
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

947
01:48:38,193 --> 01:48:43,030
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

948
01:48:43,799 --> 01:48:45,900
I wouldn't worry about it.

949
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,120
I need to sit down.

950
01:49:05,204 --> 01:49:07,388
You got no cause to hurt me.

951
01:49:07,489 --> 01:49:11,376
No. But I gave my word.

952
01:49:12,594 --> 01:49:16,464
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

953
01:49:19,301 --> 01:49:21,819
That don't make sense.

954
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,189
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

955
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:28,893
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

956
01:49:28,994 --> 01:49:32,029
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

957
01:49:36,885 --> 01:49:39,037
Not like that.

958
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:42,507
Not like you say.

959
01:49:48,297 --> 01:49:49,914
You don't have to do this.

960
01:49:50,015 --> 01:49:52,667
People always say
the same thing.

961
01:49:54,169 --> 01:49:56,186
What do they say?

962
01:49:56,288 --> 01:49:59,907
They say,
"You don't have to do this."

963
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:05,479
- You don't.
- [SIGHS] OK.

964
01:50:10,019 --> 01:50:12,586
This is the best I can do.

965
01:50:13,188 --> 01:50:14,372
Call it.

966
01:50:18,727 --> 01:50:22,563
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

967
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:27,184
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

968
01:50:27,285 --> 01:50:31,789
- Call it.
- No.

969
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:34,659
I ain't gonna call it.

970
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:39,147
Call it.

971
01:50:39,247 --> 01:50:42,299
The coin don't have no say.

972
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,435
It's just you.

973
01:50:46,621 --> 01:50:50,090
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

1007
01:54:56,905 --> 01:55:02,125
All right, then. Two of 'em, both had
my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

1008
01:55:02,227 --> 01:55:05,195
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

1009
01:55:05,296 --> 01:55:08,999
So, in a sense,
he's the younger man.

1010
01:55:09,234 --> 01:55:12,320
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

1011
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:14,888
but it was about
meeting him in town,

1012
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:17,875
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

1013
01:55:17,976 --> 01:55:19,710
I think I lost it.

1014
01:55:21,312 --> 01:55:26,033
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

1015
01:55:26,168 --> 01:55:30,421
And I was a-horseback, going
through the mountains of a night.

1016
01:55:30,522 --> 01:55:33,724
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

1017
01:55:33,825 --> 01:55:37,295
It was cold, and there was
snow on the ground.

1018
01:55:37,396 --> 01:55:39,813
And he rode past me
and kept on going,

1019
01:55:39,914 --> 01:55:42,966
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

1020
01:55:44,452 --> 01:55:48,406
He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.

1021
01:55:50,091 --> 01:55:53,894
When he rode past, I seen he was
carrying fire in a horn,

1022
01:55:53,995 --> 01:55:55,846
the way people
used to do, and I...

1023
01:55:55,947 --> 01:55:58,666
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

1024
01:55:58,767 --> 01:56:00,668
'bout the color of the moon.

1025
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:04,588
And, in the dream,
I knew that he was...

1026
01:56:05,156 --> 01:56:07,458
...going on ahead.

1027
01:56:07,559 --> 01:56:12,663
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

1028
01:56:15,967 --> 01:56:19,253
And I knew that whenever
I got there, he'd be there.

1029
01:56:23,591 --> 01:56:25,876
And then I woke up.
