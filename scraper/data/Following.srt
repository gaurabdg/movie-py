1
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:40,750
The following is my explanation.

2
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,210
Well...

3
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:48,382
more of an account
of what happened.

4
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,427
I'd been on my own
for a while...

5
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,347
and getting kind of...

6
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:57,642
lonely and bored.

7
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,727
Nothing to do all day.

8
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,773
And that's when
I started shadowing.

9
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,108
"Shadowing"?

10
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:09,570
Shadowing. Following.
I started to follow people.

11
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,823
- Who?
- Anyone at first.

12
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,326
I mean, that was the whole point.
Somebody at random.

13
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,411
Somebody who didn't know
who I was.

14
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,831
And then?

15
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,126
- And then... nothing.
- "Nothing"?

16
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,712
Nothing. I'd just see...

17
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:29,090
where they went, what they did...

18
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,301
and go home afterwards.

19
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,971
Why'd you do it?

20
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:38,099
To see where they went.

21
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,226
Anyone -- I mean --

22
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,689
How can I explain?
You ever...

23
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:49,318
been to a football match,
just let your eyes...

24
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,364
go over, drift across
a crowd of people...

25
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,368
and they slowly stop
and fix on one person...

26
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:01,163
and all of a sudden that person
isn't part of the crowd anymore?

27
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,417
They've become an individual,
just like that.

28
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:07,461
It just became irresistible.

29
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,506
- So you followed women?
- No, I didn't follow women.

30
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,550
It wasn't a sex thing.
I followed anybody.

31
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,386
I just wanted to see
where they went and what they did.

32
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,055
You were playing secret agent?

33
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,057
No, I'm a writer.

34
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,226
Well, I want to be a writer, anyway.

35
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:26,147
I was gathering material
for my characters.

36
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,190
Well, to begin with.

37
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:31,193
After a while,
I spotted the dangers.

38
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,196
I'd become hooked.
I had to start making up rules...

39
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,324
to just try
and keep it under control.

40
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,952
"Never follow people for too long."

41
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,621
"Don't follow women
down dark alleys after dark."

42
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:45,499
You know, stuff like that.

43
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,461
It was supposed
to just be completely random.

44
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,465
And when it stopped being random...

45
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,051
that's when it started to go wrong.

46
00:03:56,762 --> 00:04:00,222
When I started to follow people...

47
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,559
specific people, when I selected...

48
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:06,729
a person to follow...

49
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,481
that was when the trouble started.

50
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,906
Other people are interesting to me.
Have you never...

51
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,784
listened to other people's
conversations on the bus...

52
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,579
or on the Tube, seen people,
somebody on the street...

53
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,957
that looks interesting
or is behaving...

54
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:30,711
slightly... oddly or something
like that and wondered...

55
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,713
what their lives involved,
what they do...

56
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,591
where they come from,
where they go to?

57
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,741
You watch somebody's behavior,
and it raises...

58
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,785
a hundred thousand questions...

59
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:07,331
and I wanted to ask
those questions...

60
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:10,793
and I wanted to know
what the answers were.

61
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,796
And so I'd follow people
to try and find out.

62
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,801
The most important rule was...

63
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:22,888
that even if I found out where
somebody worked or where they lived...

64
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:25,474
then you would never follow
the same person twice.

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,144
That was the most important rule.

66
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,563
That was the one that I broke first.

67
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,047
Yes?

68
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,674
- Coffee, please.
- Come on. It's lunch.

69
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,052
Toasted cheese sandwich as well.

70
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,708
Mind if I join you?

71
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,381
Who and why?

72
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,886
Hi. Yeah, um, I'll have
a black coffee please, and --

73
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,304
What's that?

74
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,099
Another coffee, black.

75
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:36,590
You're obviously not a policeman,
so who are you and why are you following me?

76
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,650
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

77
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,943
Don't piss me about.
Who the fuck are you?

78
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,488
Oh, thank you very much.

79
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,283
Sugar?

80
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,218
No, I wasn't --
I wasn't following you.

81
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:08,637
I saw you with your bag.

82
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,764
I just thought
you looked interesting.

83
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,183
- What are you, a faggot?
- No, no.

84
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,380
Okay, to tell you the truth,
I thought you were this guy...

85
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,440
that I was at school with.

86
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,943
I saw you walk in here,
so I followed you in just to see if it was him.

87
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,321
- But it wasn't.
- Why didn't you ask me when you saw me?

88
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:28,949
'Cause I'd have been embarrassed
if it wasn't the person.

89
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,327
Not as embarrassed
as you are now.

90
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,746
- No, I suppose not.
- What's your name?

91
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,622
Bill.

92
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,083
Well, Bill, what do you do?

93
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,045
- Actually, I'm kind of --
- Between jobs right now. Yeah.

94
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,297
- Yeah. That's right.
- What would you do?

95
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,966
- Don't know.
- Oh, come on, Bill.

96
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,803
Don't be coy. There's some burning
ambition inside you, isn't there?

97
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,014
There's something
of the starving artist in you, no?

98
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,974
- No. No.
- No?

99
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,684
- You're a painter.
- No. - Photos.

100
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,770
- No.
- Writer. - No.

101
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,229
- Writer, eh?
- No.

102
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,482
- But you write.
- Not much.

103
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,650
- But sometimes.
- Sometimes. Who doesn't?

104
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,402
Me.

105
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,620
- So you're a writer.
- I didn't say that.

106
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,622
What makes you think
I'm a writer, anyway?

107
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,041
An unemployed 20-something...

108
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,461
who fancies himself a writer --
a real leap into the unknown.

109
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,714
- Well, I'm not a writer.
- But you're interested in people.

110
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,633
- Yeah.
- This person.

111
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,801
Perhaps.

112
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,803
You haven't even
asked me my name yet...

113
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:33,347
- What's your name?
- or what's in my bag.

114
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,641
- What bag?
- My bag.

115
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,893
The one you've been
looking at all morning.

116
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:42,856
What's your name,
and what's in your bag?

117
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,193
My name's Cobb.

118
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,405
Take a look for yourself.

119
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,703
What were you expecting?
Drugs?

120
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:00,249
Why would you nick their old CDs?

121
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,044
Easy to grab a load. Easy to sell.
Totally untraceable.

122
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,088
The other stuff's a bit more tricky.

123
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:11,093
You don't look like a burglar.

124
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,887
Sounds like a compliment.

125
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,931
Are you interested now?

126
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,723
Gloves.

127
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,105
- People don't really do that, do they?
- You'd be surprised.

128
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,828
Does that really work?

129
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:21,663
Wait and see.

130
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,505
Beginner's luck.

131
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,680
See? Nobody home.

132
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,351
Okay, first things first.
We need a bag.

133
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,560
A bag?

134
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,646
To carry the stuff in.
Why are you whispering?

135
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,016
Don't you have one of your own?

136
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,426
Yeah, it's a big bag with
"swag" written right across it.

137
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,193
Bingo.

138
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,363
Okay. What do you fancy?

139
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,043
- Nothing here of any value.
- You don't seem that concerned.

140
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,071
- I don't do it for the money.
- Why do you do it?

141
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:13,632
For the adrenaline. And because,
like you, I'm interested in people.

142
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,660
You can tell a lot about people
from their stuff.

143
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,387
- How old would you say these people are?
- Don't know.

144
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,723
You can tell a lot from the futon, for a start.
Young people have futons.

145
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,309
Most people wouldn't be
anywhere near 40 with a futon.

146
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:26,728
And they've got one laundry bag,
which means...

147
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,647
they're probably very used
to each other.

148
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:29,751
Probably about 25, over.

149
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:32,317
They could be 20 and have
been living together for years.

150
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,612
Nah. No, look at the books.
They're college-educated.

151
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,365
Probably graduated
when they were 21 or 22.

152
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,492
Moved in together in the last year.

153
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:43,370
You can tell more from the music.

154
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,289
And here is the box.

155
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:48,041
- What box?
- Everyone has a box.

156
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,043
With men, it's usually a shoebox.

157
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,088
- Are there valuables in it?
- No. More interesting, more personal.

158
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,090
Things like snapshots, letters...

159
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,801
or trinkets from a Christmas cracker.

160
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,012
See?

161
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,764
Envelope, photo...

162
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,933
little calling cards, notes.

163
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,228
A sort of unconscious collection.
A display.

164
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,064
- What do you mean, "display"?
- Well, display.

165
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,151
Each thing tells something
very intimate about the people.

166
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,445
We're very privileged to see it.
It's very rare.

167
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,992
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the --

168
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,745
What the hell'd you do that for?

169
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,413
It's like a diary.

170
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,791
They hide it, but actually they want
someone to see it. That's what I do.

171
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,002
Concealment, display --
flip sides of the same coin.

172
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,129
This way they know
that someone's seen it.

173
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,341
That's what it's all about --
interrupting someone's life...

174
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,926
making them see all the things
they took for granted.

175
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,679
Like when they go back and buy
all this stuff from the shelves...

176
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,765
with the insurance money,
they'll have to think...

177
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,850
for the first time in a long time...

178
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,020
why they wanted all this stuff,
what it's for.

179
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,022
You take it away...

180
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,232
and show them what they had.

181
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:02,366
Saucy, eh?
Found these in the last flat.

182
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,203
Think I'll just give them
something to chat about.

183
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,211
Why would you do that?

184
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,857
She'll find them in his trousers
and ask him what he's been doing.

185
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:13,043
Yeah, but why would you want
to fuck up their relationship?

186
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,630
Don't you listen?
You take it away...

187
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,174
and show them what they had.

188
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:29,309
- Fancy a drink?
- You've gotta be joking.

189
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,770
Oh, don't be fooled
by the supermarket label.

190
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:35,315
I seem to remember I've had this before,
and it was actually quite good.

191
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,903
You'd have had a bit of difficulty
doing this with your gloves on.

192
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:46,618
- So we actually gonna take anything?
- Anything your heart desires.

193
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:50,580
Although that's not really the point, is it?
I mean, it's just work.

194
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,041
I thought the whole point of burglary
was taking things.

195
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,712
No, this is the point -- breaking in,
entering someone's life...

196
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:58,755
finding out who they really are.

197
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,299
I mean, don't you just feel it?
Standing here...

198
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,386
drinking their wine --
people we'll never even meet.

199
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,434
Would you like a drink?
I've got some wine.

200
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,645
Holy f--

201
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,417
You startled us! Are you from the agency,
or are you viewing like us?

202
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,718
What are you
doing in my flat?

203
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,619
Didn't the agent tell you
we'd be here this afternoon?

204
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,471
But we're not moving.

205
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:25,073
You must be the man of the house.
Congratulations. You have a very nice home.

206
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:31,747
- But we're not moving.
- Really?

207
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:33,833
Oh, then I should check
with the agent then, love.

208
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,834
Bye.

209
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,770
Shit. We shouldn't have come up here.
We're gonna have to wait ages to get down.

210
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,605
There's a way up here.

211
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,693
Jesus Christ!
Do you think they believed you?

212
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,945
Of course they didn't
fucking believe me.

213
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,031
What the hell
do you think you were doing?

214
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,825
- I caught them on the hop. We surprised them.
- How do you mean?

215
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,354
That bloke wasn't her boyfriend.
Why do you think he didn't say anything?

216
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:14,440
No, she was up to no good, and she was
probably glad we weren't her boyfriend.

217
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,209
- You reckon?
- Definitely. Why else would she be home...

218
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,002
in the middle of the afternoon?

219
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,197
No, you just can't plan
for that kind of fucking shit.

220
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:24,216
We were unlucky.
Don't worry about it. It won't happen again.

221
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,635
- Yeah, well, I'm not so sure.
- Oh, yeah?

222
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,137
Well, next time you can do
the fucking prep work.

223
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,972
- No, no, I didn't mean --
- No, I mean it.

224
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,849
Take your mark, check it out...

225
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,435
for days, months, years, whatever.

226
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,772
- It'll be the next place we hit.
- Yeah, all right.

227
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,816
- Tell you what.
- What?

228
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:43,443
I feel bad about pulling
the panty routine on that bloke.

229
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,289
She's gonna give him loads of shit,
and she's the one fooling around.

230
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,634
A beer, please.

231
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,575
- Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

232
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:16,620
- But you can't sleep with me.
- Why is that?

233
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,788
'Cause I'm with the guy over there.

234
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,042
Not that bald one.

235
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,337
He'll let you buy me a drink,
but sex is completely out of the question.

236
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,091
- Still want to buy me that drink?
- No.

237
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:39,085
- So what's a nice girl like you...
- Doing in a place like this.

238
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,665
Doing with a bald old cunt like that?

239
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,422
It's a long story. And keep your voice down,
'cause he does own this place.

240
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,273
I was trying to get your attention.

241
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:52,447
My name's Daniel Lloyd.
My friends call me Danny.

242
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,407
So?

243
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,371
So you've obviously had a bad day...

244
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:02,457
the kind that makes you feel like
everybody's out for their pound of flesh.

245
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:06,461
Yeah.

246
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,464
I've been having
quite a lot of days like that.

247
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:16,471
- Say something to me.
- Like what?

248
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,184
I'll see you outside in ten minutes.

249
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,672
- Oh, I'm sorry. It just --
- Just came apart in your hands.

250
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,633
- It did, actually.
- Yeah, I know. It was broken already.

251
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,468
It's all right.
Somebody dropped it.

252
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,138
I've been meaning to fix it...

253
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,849
but...

254
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:03,393
I'll probably never get around to it.

255
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,187
So take a seat.
Make yourself at home.

256
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:13,236
- So about you and this bald guy, then.
- What about him?

257
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:16,197
- Going out with him?
- Not exactly.

258
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,034
But you and him have
something going.

259
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:22,162
We used to go out with each other,
but that's been over for a long time.

260
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,164
So why did you tell me
you were with him?

261
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,875
To get rid of you.

262
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:30,962
So why, when you agreed to have
a drink with me, did we have to come here?

263
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:33,590
He still gets jealous, and...

264
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,868
- I didn't feel like going back to my place.
- Why not?

265
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,136
I got burgled yesterday.

266
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,557
What's it feel like, being broken into?

267
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,559
Most people ask,
"What did they take?"

268
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,853
I'm curious about the way people feel.

269
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:50,398
I'm a writer.

270
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:52,734
Gosh.

271
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,444
- So?
- So?

272
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,864
- So how'd it feel?
- Great.

273
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,741
Sorry.

274
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,078
So this bald guy --
he's dangerous, is he?

275
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:05,914
- Christ, you are a nosy bastard.
- Dangerous like how?

276
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,917
Dangerous like
criminal-type dangerous.

277
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,419
Dangerous like
"involved in bad things" type dangerous.

278
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:13,463
- What sort of bad things?
- The usual.

279
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:16,674
- Girls, drugs, magazines.
- Magazines?

280
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,427
And films. Pornography.
And he owns a couple of clubs.

281
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:22,889
- Wealthy type?
- Yes.

282
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,183
And refined.

283
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,104
Took me a long time to realize
the kind of things he was capable of.

284
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,773
And what sort of things are they?

285
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,443
Perhaps another time.

286
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,113
I really think I should be going.

287
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,169
Yeah?

288
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,631
- It's me -- Bill.
- What the fuck do you want?

289
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,634
- Advice.
- On what?

290
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:02,720
- On a job.
- What fucking job?

291
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:06,266
- The job that I told you about.
- Not interested.

292
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,310
Yeah, I know that.
I'm gonna do it myself.

293
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,604
Wanna know something
about protection.

294
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,857
- "Protection"?
- Yeah. You know...

295
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,943
self-defense, weapons,
stuff like that.

296
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,321
Surprisingly enough, I thought
you might be able to give me some advice.

297
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:25,201
Steel whip.
Nunchucks, they're all right.

298
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,037
Tools are good -- sharpened
screwdriver, hammer, chisel --

299
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:31,124
- "Hammer"?
- Yeah. Medium size. Good rubber grip.

300
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,752
It's very nasty. If you get a claw hammer,
you can pry doors with it.

301
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,463
Slip it into the back
of your waistband, you're set.

302
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,676
You still there?

303
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,863
Why don't you get some of these,
for chrissake?

304
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,866
- Where did you get them?
- Stole them from Middlesex Hospital.

305
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,659
You can't buy them.

306
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,832
Bin-fucking-go.

307
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:20,548
Okay. You get the bag.
I'll check out the stuff.

308
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:44,239
- I got one.
- Oh, that's good.

309
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,157
May not need it, though.
There's fuck-all here.

310
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:46,841
Really?

311
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,204
- Well, what about the telly?
- It's fucking useless.

312
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,290
What are we, burglars or vandals?

313
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,626
Well, if you're a burglar,
why don't you start burgling?

314
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,253
What about the tapes?

315
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,972
Not much of a collection,
and it's a bit personal.

316
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:03,784
What do you mean?

317
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,971
Not the stuff you'd play to your dinner
party guests to fill in gaps in conversation.

318
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,114
What sort of music's that?

319
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,657
I don't know. Simply Red,
Fleetwood Mac, that kind of shit.

320
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,893
- He's got taste.
- Each to his own...

321
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,729
but he's a sad fucker
with no social life.

322
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,402
- Nice machine.
- Maybe he's a writer.

323
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,654
Nah. If he was a writer,
he'd have a word processor.

324
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,449
This guy wants to be a writer,
and those are two totally separate things.

325
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,913
You checked this out?

326
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,559
You watched him go to work?
You saw his routine?

327
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,066
Yeah.

328
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,293
- What's his job?
- He works in a bank.

329
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,920
This guy's unemployed.

330
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,840
- No, he's not.
- Look at the desk. He's unemployed.

331
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,202
People who have jobs don't have
this fucking shit in their homes.

332
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,219
He's either unemployed
or is a student...

333
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:51,347
which means he could be back
any fucking second. What the fuck is that?

334
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,976
I mean, you should recognize
the dole, boy. His fucking UB40!

335
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:58,104
You fucking asshole! You didn't
check this out at all. We're going now.

336
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,899
We're not gonna take anything?

337
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,928
No, we're not.
I don't feel like scrounging off...

338
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,154
some poor dole-head fucker --
no offense.

339
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:09,157
None taken.

340
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,745
Let's go to someplace
I've checked out.

341
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,697
Hi. Make yourself at home.
I'll be down in just a minute.

342
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,756
- Nice place.
- Thanks.

343
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:51,092
Feel a bit funny about it,
you know, since...

344
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,678
someone's been going through my stuff.
It's sort of creepy.

345
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:55,263
What'd they take?

346
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,433
Books, my camera, CDs.

347
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,727
They even took a bag
from my cupboard to take it away in.

348
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,974
- Apparently that's pretty standard.
- Must be terrible, losing all that stuff.

349
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:08,526
Insurance will cover most of it.
It's personal stuff that's worse.

350
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:10,403
"Personal stuff"? Like what?

351
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,114
They, um,
rifled through my underwear.

352
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,533
Shit. Why would they do that?

353
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,412
Come on. You know the kind of kinky,
voyeuristic shit men get into.

354
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,165
No, I'm sorry.
I'm not into any of that.

355
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,794
One other thing they did was
they took one of my earrings.

356
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:29,698
The didn't take the pair, they just took one,
just to really fuck me off.

357
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,091
You probably misplaced
the other one or something.

358
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,011
Oh, no. I mean,
I had them on my dresser.

359
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,138
I came back,
and there was just one.

360
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:40,475
- So you just wear the other one now.
- Gives me something to talk about.

361
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:44,145
I'll --
I'll go and get some clothes on.

362
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,012
Bill?

363
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:23,364
Saucy, eh?

364
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,367
You haven't found a bag yet?

365
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:29,578
- Is this her flat?
- Yeah. She's a fox.

366
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,664
She's got pictures
of herself everywhere.

367
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,833
Yeah. She looks good.

368
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,127
Look at this stuff.

369
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:49,598
- You should take some of this stuff.
- No way.

370
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:51,726
Suit yourself.
I'm gonna take some, though.

371
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:53,811
Look at her. She's a babe.

372
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,950
Bingo.

373
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,271
Why does she have
so many pictures of herself?

374
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,123
I think she's a model.
She's certainly vain.

375
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,796
Is that about it?

376
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:05,800
Yeah, I guess
that covers the useful stuff.

377
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:11,639
Stereo's too big.

378
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,809
Piano definitely too big.
I think...

379
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:17,645
I'll just misplace this for her.

380
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,789
- What is this place?
- Used to be offices.

381
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,375
- How'd you get the keys?
- Broke in, changed the locks.

382
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:23,711
It's owned by one of those
management places, you know?

383
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,907
They never come around, and if they do,
they'll just think they've mixed up their keys.

384
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:31,093
Eventually they'll break in and change
the locks, but I'll be long gone by then.

385
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,013
London's full of these dead spaces.

386
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,056
Above restaurants or shops.
Whole buildings.

387
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:38,976
- Do we leave the stuff here?
- No, that's your job.

388
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:41,770
You hang on to it till I let you know
we're ready to fence it.

389
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,772
- Okay.
- Unless...

390
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,859
you want to try to sell it yourself
and give me half of what you get.

391
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,819
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

392
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:52,072
Look, I was hard on you
on that last place...

393
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,992
but you've got to understand:
I won't let anybody put me at risk.

394
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:56,678
- It's dangerous enough already.
- Sure.

395
00:34:57,954 --> 00:35:00,247
- An early supper, I think.
- I really can't afford it.

396
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:02,583
- It's covered.
- Yeah?

397
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,418
Okay.

398
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,258
Authentic, I don't know,
but I like it.

399
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,844
So you keep on coming in here?

400
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,705
- I know. I like it, but --
- Why, I don't know.

401
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:18,223
No, I do know why.

402
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,225
- Why?
- Well, because there's no windows...

403
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:23,520
and because it's dark, and nobody
can see you in the alcoves...

404
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,941
and so perhaps the bald guy
wouldn't come past.

405
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,610
- Maybe.
- Maybe. Maybe this is where you bring

406
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:33,113
all the guys you go out with,
because you know that he's...

407
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,699
not just gonna be walking by,
popping in.

408
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:40,079
- Maybe.
- Maybe, yeah.

409
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,581
I thought it was over
between you two.

410
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,084
It is.

411
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,295
So how come you still go
to basement bars, then...

412
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:50,297
so that you can't be seen by him?

413
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:53,702
- Because, as I've told you before --
- Because you're afraid of him, 'cause he's --

414
00:35:53,802 --> 00:35:55,594
- Because he's dangerous.
- Dangerous.

415
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,722
Dangerous -- How-How dangerous?
You keep on saying he's dangerous.

416
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,100
You never explain to me...

417
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,268
why you're so afraid of him.

418
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,604
Okay.

419
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,606
He came around to my flat...

420
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,985
with a couple of his associates...

421
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:14,947
and... I didn't really know
what all this was about...

422
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,992
until this other guy arrived...

423
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,411
who apparently owed them
some money.

424
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:22,913
They didn't like this very much,
so they got a hammer.

425
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:28,293
They held him down, and they smashed
every single one of his fingers.

426
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:37,761
And then they smashed his skull.

427
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,683
Someone get me
a tea towel or something.

428
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:49,982
You're joking with me.

429
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,608
No.

430
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,905
You're not joking with me.

431
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:03,287
This is why you don't
go out with him anymore.

432
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:07,166
No. No, no. That's because
he made a mess on my carpet.

433
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,003
That's not funny.

434
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:12,796
I know.

435
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:23,065
How on earth did you get
to fall in with somebody like this?

436
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,506
Let's just change the subject,
all right?

437
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:27,128
He's not the sort of bloke I'd have
thought you'd normally associate with.

438
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:29,688
- Come on.
- What were you doing? Were you...

439
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,066
"working" for him at the time?

440
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:39,573
That is none of your business.

441
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:43,118
I think you better find someone else
to start telling you little stories.

442
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,204
Oh, come on.
I was just joking.

443
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:34,539
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

444
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,417
Think, think, think, think, think, think.

445
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:05,737
You're developing a taste for it.

446
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,573
The violating, the voyeurism --
oh, it's definitely you.

447
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,784
- I think not.
- I think so.

448
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,105
And before long you'll have developed a taste
for all the things that go with the proceeds.

449
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,123
- Such as?
- Well, all this.

450
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,584
Do you make all your money
through burglary?

451
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,378
No, not all of it.

452
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:24,631
- In fact, you're gonna pay for this.
- I told you: I can't afford to.

453
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:28,051
Don't worry. It won't really be you.
It'll be D. Lloyd that pays for this.

454
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:30,637
I thought I'd give you the pleasure
of pretending to pay.

455
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:33,515
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Sign it.

456
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:35,267
- "Sign it"?
- Sign it.

457
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,603
In your own handwriting.
Then you can do anything you want with it.

458
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,522
"D. Lloyd."

459
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:58,206
Don't you ever worry
about being caught?

460
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,501
Why else would I do it?
Besides, I'm not gonna get caught.

461
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:05,005
- What, you've thought it all through?
- I've thought it all through.

462
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:10,010
This is only the tip of the iceberg.

463
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,137
I will do things
that you don't even believe.

464
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,389
- Such as --
- Example:

465
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,626
Sometimes when I'm watching a flat,
I'll see that the owners...

466
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,643
are about to go on holiday.

467
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,022
I'll wait till they're gone,
then move in for a week or two.

468
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,315
You've got to be joking.

469
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,442
No. Happens a lot more
than you'd believe.

470
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:27,178
How do you know
when they're gonna be back?

471
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,180
It's almost always marked
on the kitchen calendar.

472
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,198
Christ.

473
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,037
Jesus fucking Christ!

474
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,898
- What's wrong?
- The woman -- from the first flat.

475
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:41,358
- The one we broke into. She just walked in.
- Are you sure?

476
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,486
- Yes, I am fucking sure.
- Is she with the same bloke?

477
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:44,878
- No.
- It's all right, then.

478
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:45,683
What if she sees us?

479
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,448
She's with her partner.
She can't do anything.

480
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,674
I think that's
one hell of a chance to take.

481
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:52,495
What's she gonna say? We stole half
a bottle of indifferent red wine? Calm down.

482
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:55,222
- Do you mind if we skip dessert?
- Yes, I fucking mind.

483
00:42:55,348 --> 00:42:57,682
- She's coming this way.
- She's going to the loo.

484
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,559
- She saw me.
- Oh, yeah?

485
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:02,479
She saw me. She recognizes us.
I think we should leave.

486
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:04,189
Okay.

487
00:43:05,274 --> 00:43:07,692
We'll leave. Not that we've got
anything to worry about...

488
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,737
except for you making
a fucking twat out of yourself.

489
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,327
I really hate it when I don't get to finish
a good meal with a cup of coffee.

490
00:43:17,453 --> 00:43:19,413
- Yeah, but --
- Don't fucking say it.

491
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,540
She got a second look at me.
She recognized me.

492
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,458
That sort of thing makes me nervous.

493
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,903
If you're so worried about your appearance,
why don't you change it?

494
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,879
You know, new haircut,
new set of clothes.

495
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,992
Your mother won't recognize you. Just
because you break into people's homes...

496
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:33,927
doesn't mean you have to look
like a fucking burglar.

497
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,172
"Everybody has a box."

498
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,864
- Yeah?
- Hello. It's Bill.

499
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,866
Oh, hello, Bill.
What can I do for you?

500
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:27,160
Not much. It's about the stuff.

501
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:29,746
What about the stuff?

502
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:33,416
I've, met this guy.
Said he would fence most of it.

503
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:36,002
I thought I'd have a go myself,
like you said.

504
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:39,839
I don't reckon
I'll get as much as you could...

505
00:47:39,965 --> 00:47:43,968
but, um, you'll have half
of whatever I get.

506
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,553
How does that sound?

507
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,555
Well, that sounds fine.
Anything else?

508
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:49,683
- Yeah, I took your advice.
- What advice?

509
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,602
About changing my appearance.
Got my hair cut. I'm all dressed up.

510
00:47:52,728 --> 00:47:54,354
With no place to go.

511
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,841
God, Bill, I wasn't being
entirely serious about that, you know?

512
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,983
Yeah.

513
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,528
I just feel better this way.

514
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:03,029
- Safer, huh?
- Safer.

515
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:05,365
I'll give you a ring
when I get the money.

516
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:07,200
Right.

517
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:13,206
What was all that about?

518
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:15,208
You.

519
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:18,670
Your stuff, anyway.
He's gonna deal with it himself.

520
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,755
Meaning?

521
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:23,049
Meaning he took the bait,
and he's hooked.

522
00:48:23,217 --> 00:48:26,886
He's gonna hang on to the stuff,
pretend to sell it, give me some money.

523
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:29,431
You may even get most of it back,
if you're lucky.

524
00:48:29,557 --> 00:48:32,183
God, it's perfect.
The photos worked.

525
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,936
I even got him to cut his hair
and change his clothes.

526
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:38,606
So does that mean you'll tell me
where you hid my earring?

527
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,066
No.

528
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:42,193
And I wouldn't wait
for your panties either.

529
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,195
He's too embarrassed
to give those back to you.

530
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,573
Shit. And did you have
to break my window?

531
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:48,825
Couldn't you have found
a key or something?

532
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:51,161
No, that would've been
three spare keys in a row.

533
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:53,788
Even Bill's not going to fall for that.

534
00:48:53,914 --> 00:48:56,583
God, it was so embarrassing
when we went to his place.

535
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:59,586
Right under the mat, just like I told him.
It's totally pathetic.

536
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:01,697
It was a new mat as well,
and I seriously think...

537
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:04,215
he bought this mat just so
he could put the key under it.

538
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:08,965
Fuck off.

539
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:10,800
How did you know it was me?

540
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:14,095
That could've been your mother
you just told to fuck off.

541
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:15,889
I meant it.

542
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:19,392
Oh, come on. Let me in.
I've come to apologize.

543
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,744
- So apologize.
- I haven't been entirely honest with you.

544
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,748
I'm doing a piece about burglaries.

545
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:43,416
What?

546
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:48,212
I'm writing about burglaries,
about a friend of mine...

547
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,381
who breaks into people's houses.

548
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:54,093
That's why I asked you
so many questions about your break-in.

549
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:57,099
I didn't tell you at the time 'cause
I didn't want to upset you too much.

550
00:51:57,222 --> 00:52:00,475
He's been breaking in, and I've been --
I haven't stolen anything.

551
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:04,896
I just go along and...
see what happens.

552
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,357
Is that it?

553
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:09,901
Yes.

554
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,945
What's that got to do with anything?

555
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,907
Now I've been honest with you.
I want you to return the favor.

556
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,160
- I have been honest with you.
- You're still seeing the bald guy.

557
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:21,788
I was early the other day,
and I saw him leave.

558
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:24,832
- You said it was over.
- It is.

559
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,752
Then why are you still seeing him?

560
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,381
He's blackmailing me.

561
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:35,760
- He's rich. Why on earth would he --
- I didn't say anything about money.

562
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,763
- What's he blackmailing you with?
- Photos.

563
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,264
Of?

564
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,008
Of me.

565
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:43,236
Don't ask me anything else.

566
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:45,143
I'm not feeding your
seedy little fantasies.

567
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:46,589
You've got me all wrong,
you know.

568
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:48,481
- Have I?
- Yes.

569
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:52,610
- Where are these pictures?
- In his office. Why?

570
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:55,697
- I could take them.
- How?

571
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:58,616
I could break in.
Me and this guy could do it.

572
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,369
There's got to be some valuable stuff
in his office, right?

573
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:04,706
- He sometimes keeps some money in his safe.
- We can't get into his safe.

574
00:53:04,832 --> 00:53:07,166
- That's where the photos are.
- What?

575
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:10,169
They're in an envelope --
the negatives and some of the prints.

576
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:13,297
- We can't do that.
- I know the combination.

577
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,966
How?

578
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,676
I've seen him open it
loads of times.

579
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:18,803
I thought I might be able
to lift them myself.

580
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,348
That's what we'll do, then.

581
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:31,357
No one in their right minds
would steal from him.

582
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:34,485
If we don't get caught, it's not gonna
matter who it was we stole from...

583
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,696
and we're not going to get caught.

584
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,285
If you get them,
you won't look at the photos...

585
00:53:42,411 --> 00:53:44,370
and you won't even look
in the envelope.

586
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:47,415
- Of course not.
- I've got your word on that?

587
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:49,542
You have my word.

588
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:14,025
- You're late.
- Sorry.

589
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,569
I thought you said
you were gonna fence it yourself.

590
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:18,654
I got rid of most of it.

591
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,088
It'll take me a couple days
to get rid of all this.

592
00:54:35,214 --> 00:54:37,131
That's what I thought.

593
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,805
Is there something else
on your mind?

594
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:46,432
Yeah. I want to hit a place.

595
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,518
I've been scouting out
a couple places.

596
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:51,479
- A particular place. For some photos.
- "Photos"?

597
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:53,856
Yeah, for a friend.

598
00:54:53,982 --> 00:54:54,941
What's the place?

599
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,819
The photos are in a safe,
but I've got the combination.

600
00:54:57,945 --> 00:55:00,321
Well, if it's for a friend,
where's the money in it?

601
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,324
Money's in the safe... probably.

602
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,577
"Probably." Whose office?

603
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,539
- A club owner. Pornographer type.
- Heavy?

604
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:11,374
Yeah, looks like it.

605
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,841
What the fuck's going on?

606
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:25,263
- I'm seeing someone.
- Who?

607
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:28,975
- The owner of that bag.
- What?

608
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:32,019
The woman whose house we hit,
the one with the pictures of herself.

609
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:34,188
Tell me you're fucking joking.

610
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:35,815
No.

611
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:40,111
I thought she looked interesting,
I followed her...

612
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:44,240
- we had a drink, and... now we're involved.
- Have you slept with her?

613
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,244
Yeah. We're gettin' on really well.

614
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,664
I wanted to give some of her stuff back
to her, but I thought that would mean --

615
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,442
You thought that would mean telling her
that you fucking robbed her!

616
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:56,669
How shrewd! I mean, how fucking
prudent of you not to tell her that!

617
00:55:58,005 --> 00:55:59,922
That's a nice haircut, though.

618
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:01,632
Nice suit as well.

619
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,718
- Pity about the bloodstains on it.
- What blood--

620
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:39,253
You're on your own now.

621
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:42,048
Here.
Here's a present for you...

622
00:56:42,174 --> 00:56:45,468
to get you started
on your new solo career.

623
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,294
- Did you have to beat him?
- Did you have to sleep with him?

624
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,671
- You told me to.
- I said you should if you had to...

625
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:06,215
but that's not really the same
as telling you to.

626
00:58:09,594 --> 00:58:12,179
- Did you enjoy it?
- Did you enjoy beating him up?

627
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:14,807
Of course.

628
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,272
Look, I'm in deep shit.
This is going to work.

629
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,274
Do they really think
you're involved?

630
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,344
They've already had me in
for questioning, haven't they?

631
00:58:25,444 --> 00:58:28,904
It's not gonna be long before they find
the guy who saw me leave and pull me in.

632
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:30,865
- Did he get a good look at you?
- No.

633
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:32,950
Which is why I think
this is gonna work.

634
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,187
All we need is someone
of roughly the same appearance...

635
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:38,039
roughly the same way of working,
and we should be fine.

636
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:40,525
Just tell them what really happened,
that you found her like that.

637
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,668
No, you wouldn't say that
if you saw what I saw.

638
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:44,712
No, I mean, this is horrible.

639
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:47,590
There's blood everywhere.

640
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:50,843
I mean, her head has been beaten.
She doesn't even look human anymore.

641
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:53,012
I mean, I'd been there a while.

642
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:56,349
I may have left traces, prints,
forensic shit. I don't know.

643
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:59,602
The point is, the body's fresh.
It hasn't been dead long.

644
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:02,480
Any witness might put me there
close enough to the time of death.

645
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,675
You just said the witness
didn't get a good look at you.

646
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:06,650
No, but that's not the point, is it?

647
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,028
A crime that brutal --
an old lady beaten to death.

648
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:12,140
If they even think it's me, they're gonna
try and pin it on me, aren't they?

649
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,935
No, we've got to have someone else.
I've even told them there's someone else.

650
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:18,454
- And if he's got an alibi?
- Well, he's a loner.

651
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,122
He's perfect.

652
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:22,776
Even strangers that have seen him before
aren't gonna recognize him...

653
00:59:22,876 --> 00:59:25,211
because he's had his hair cut.

654
00:59:25,337 --> 00:59:27,380
No, he's our man.

655
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,072
I've got it.

656
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:56,867
I've got to drop off
the fucking money first.

657
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:00,496
Money. Bundles of fucking money.

658
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,876
Nothing. Nothing.

659
01:00:08,922 --> 01:00:12,716
"Okay"?

660
01:00:14,928 --> 01:00:17,930
I'll -- I'll be around soon.

661
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:04,185
You promised me
you wouldn't open the envelope.

662
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:05,769
It wasn't sealed. They fell out.

663
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,981
- "They fell out."
- So are you gonna explain?

664
01:01:09,107 --> 01:01:12,985
I mean, what was it? Was it all
just bullshit to get hold of the money?

665
01:01:13,153 --> 01:01:14,945
There isn't usually any in there.

666
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,822
Well, what, then?

667
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,329
It was for a friend.

668
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:25,998
The police think he did something,
and he didn't...

669
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:29,960
so he needs a decoy,
another likely suspect.

670
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:34,006
Someone caught robbing a place using
the same way he does it, his methods.

671
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:35,841
"His methods"?

672
01:01:37,344 --> 01:01:38,928
Who is the friend?

673
01:01:40,722 --> 01:01:41,972
Cobb.

674
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,017
Broke into a place
a couple of weeks ago.

675
01:01:45,143 --> 01:01:47,311
He found an old lady
bashed to death.

676
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,939
He ran off. Someone saw him.

677
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:53,176
Couple of days later, the police called him in
for questioning. They think he killed her.

678
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,486
He probably did.

679
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,863
No, he's a thief.
He's not a murderer.

680
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:00,574
So he told them
that they'd got him confused...

681
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,744
with another burglar he knew,
one who used the same MO.

682
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,247
Why me?

683
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:09,291
You set yourself up for it.

684
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:13,420
Cobb noticed you following him
days before he actually approached you.

685
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:15,506
Well, initially he thought
you were police...

686
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,883
- and then he followed you.
- He followed me?

687
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:22,346
He followed you
and realized you were just...

688
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,057
this sad little fucker
waiting to be used.

689
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:27,935
So you and Cobb just went for it.

690
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:30,896
How could you do this to me?

691
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:33,190
To anybody?

692
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,318
It's not that serious.

693
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:38,946
You've got the money.
You didn't kill the old lady.

694
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:42,283
You're just there to plant doubt
in the minds of the police.

695
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:44,577
They'll never charge you.

696
01:02:44,744 --> 01:02:46,912
You were supposed to get caught
tonight breaking in.

697
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,207
They'd pull you in, ask you about the old lady,
and you wouldn't know anything.

698
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,876
They could still have charged me
for breaking and entering.

699
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,546
But you did break and enter.

700
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:57,953
And for whatever reason,
you didn't get caught red-handed.

701
01:03:01,136 --> 01:03:04,013
He came in. He went down.

702
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:07,975
I didn't hang around long enough
to find out whether he could get up.

703
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:11,020
It's his blood on my hammer.

704
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:14,440
How could you do this to me?

705
01:03:14,566 --> 01:03:17,026
It's nothing personal.

706
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:19,695
When I began this,
I didn't even know you.

707
01:03:26,828 --> 01:03:29,371
- I'm going to the police in the morning.
- You can't.

708
01:03:30,749 --> 01:03:32,958
I'm going,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

709
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:34,960
You can't,
'cause they won't believe you.

710
01:03:35,086 --> 01:03:37,480
I'm gonna tell them everything.
They'll believe me because it's the truth.

711
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,695
Not if you haven't got
someone to back up your story.

712
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:43,093
- You could.
- I won't.

713
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,680
They'll make you, because your lies
won't stand up to the truth.

714
01:03:52,312 --> 01:03:55,814
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

715
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,488
That's it.

716
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,867
I mean, if you've got
any questions, then --

717
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:09,536
One or two.

718
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:12,623
You see, we don't actually have
any unsolved murders of old ladies...

719
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:15,376
- at the present.
- You must have.

720
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:19,713
There's no such ongoing investigation.

721
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,341
And we don't know
this Mr. Cobb of yours.

722
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,512
I warned you
he'd look in the envelope.

723
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,682
He gave me his word.
I believed him.

724
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:32,059
It's nothing personal.
He couldn't help it.

725
01:04:32,185 --> 01:04:34,186
I mean, he's a born peeper.

726
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:41,026
Anyway, down to business.

727
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:43,362
"Business"?

728
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,366
Perhaps there's...

729
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:50,536
something else
you'd like to tell me?

730
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:54,123
Anything.

731
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:58,544
- Where's the hammer?
- It's in that bag.

732
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,798
What are you gonna do with it?

733
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:07,886
The old man was very specific
about how I should do things.

734
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:12,015
What's the old man
got to say about it?

735
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:15,310
Well, he is letting me keep
all the money from his safe.

736
01:05:16,563 --> 01:05:18,856
Anything at all.

737
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,691
Your side of things.

738
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,821
He says your demands
have become too unreasonable.

739
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:28,240
You've become too greedy
in your blackmail.

740
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:31,076
He said something
about you being a witness...

741
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:33,579
to an incident
that happened in this very room.

742
01:05:33,747 --> 01:05:37,624
He was very precise about exactly
how and where I should take care of things.

743
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,085
Something about
a bloodstained carpet...

744
01:05:40,253 --> 01:05:42,838
that you've got stashed away
to back up your story...

745
01:05:42,964 --> 01:05:45,090
should it ever be told.

746
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,427
Did you talk to her?

747
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,763
We found her this morning.

748
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,142
What do you mean, "found her"?

749
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:57,060
Her body.

750
01:05:58,104 --> 01:06:01,690
We also found a hammer
with two types of blood on it.

751
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:05,486
One type I assume will match
the bloke you put in hospital.

752
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:08,530
All her fingers were smashed.

753
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:10,949
You must have tortured her
to get the combination.

754
01:06:11,075 --> 01:06:13,118
I didn't touch her!

755
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,080
We also found
some interesting items in your flat...

756
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,917
in this shoebox under your bed.

757
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:24,171
Among various items reported missing
by the deceased last week, we found...

758
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:27,299
these pairs of ladies' underwear.

759
01:06:27,425 --> 01:06:29,343
Are they hers?

760
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:32,513
I assume so,
since we found them stashed...

761
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,474
with these passport-style
photographs of the deceased.

762
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:40,771
We also found this pearl earring...

763
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:43,315
which exactly matched...

764
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:46,193
the one worn by the deceased
at the time of her death.

765
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,862
- A little trophy?
- No.

766
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:52,491
It was Cobb who planted it
when we turned over her place.

767
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:55,285
Go and collar him.
I gave you his address.

768
01:06:56,913 --> 01:07:00,332
We checked the address you gave us.
There's no Cobb there.

769
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,001
The flat belongs to a Mr...

770
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,505
D. Lloyd.

771
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,133
He's just returned from holiday...

772
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,846
and he told us that while he was away,
his flat had been burgled.

773
01:07:13,972 --> 01:07:16,098
Not much was missing...

774
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:19,643
but his new credit card
hasn't yet arrived.

775
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,062
Well, that was Cobb.
We used it to...

776
01:07:22,188 --> 01:07:24,690
pay for a meal in a restaurant.

777
01:07:24,816 --> 01:07:27,192
We found this at your flat.

778
01:07:28,862 --> 01:07:30,821
It was Cobb...

779
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:33,740
who stole it.

780
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:36,076
Is that your handwriting?

781
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:40,372
Yes.
