1
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,921
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,798
Time to wake up.

3
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,174
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,468
I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,136
That's what Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,187
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,815
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,316
All right.

9
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,527
Got it. Got it. Look, look!

10
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,028
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,571
Your breakfast is getting cold.

12
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,948
It's cereal.

13
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,449
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,973
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,724
Okay.

16
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,905
Here's your books.

17
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,240
Go ahead.

18
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,038
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment,
I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,957
Yes, she's coming right now.

20
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,584
Just a second, she'll be with you.

21
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,546
Just one second, please.
You deal with this one. I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,508
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,803
I can see you're on a party line...

24
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,141
Unfortunately, some people
do listen in on party lines. We...

25
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,893
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,398
- Oh, my...
- Everything all right?

27
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,070
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was having trouble
with the connection.

28
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,821
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, Mom.

29
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,281
How was school?

30
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,616
- Okay.
- Yeah?

31
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
We learned about dinosaurs.

32
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,995
And I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.

33
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,289
- What happened?
- He hit me.

34
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,958
Did you hit him back?

35
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,292
Good.

36
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,627
Rule number one, remember?

37
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,463
Never start a fight, always finish it.

38
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,008
- Why'd he hit you?
- Because I hit him.

39
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,929
You hit him first? Why?

40
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,517
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

41
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,980
Honey, your father never met you,
so how could he not like you?

42
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,856
Then why did he leave?

43
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:23,364
Well, because the day you were born,
something else arrived in the mail.

44
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,366
And it was in a box
a little bit bigger than you.

45
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,034
You know what was in it?

46
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,328
Something called responsibility.

47
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,997
And to some people,

48
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,833
responsibility is
the scariest thing in the world.

49
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,213
So, he ran away because he was scared
of what was in that box?

50
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,339
Uh-huh.

51
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,757
That's just dumb.

52
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,218
That is exactly what I thought.

53
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,732
Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?

54
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,734
I'm afraid so, sport.

55
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,694
Come now, time for bed.

56
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,368
Are we still going to the movies tomorrow?

57
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,705
Uh-huh. I hear
there's a new Charlie Chaplin picture

58
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,624
and a new serial called
The Mysterious Airman.

59
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,043
Who's that?

60
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,338
I don't know. Nobody does.
That's what makes him so mysterious.

61
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,884
Am I too heavy for you to carry?

62
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,221
Oh, no, not for years.
Not for years.

63
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,231
- Hello?
- This is Margaret.

64
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,483
Hi, Margaret.

65
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,401
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

66
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,196
Listen, Jean can't come in today and now
we're a little shorthanded.

67
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,656
- When did she call in sick?
- About half hour ago.

68
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,366
I'm having a hard time
trying to find someone.

69
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,160
Well, what about Myrna?

70
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,578
I know she could use the extra hours and...

71
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,747
She's busy. Can't you come?

72
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,541
No. No, no, no. I just...

73
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,339
I promised Walter that
I'd take him to the movies, is all, and...

74
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,715
Well, it's just until 4:00.

75
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,760
All right. Just until 4:00.

76
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,012
I'll see you then.

77
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,020
There's a sandwich and milk in the fridge,

78
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,524
and I've asked Mrs. Riley and her daughter
to stop in in a couple of hours.

79
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,776
I can take care of myself.

80
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,529
I know you can.
They're checking on the house, not you.

81
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,540
Tomorrow we will go to the movies.

82
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,545
And then we'll ride Big Red
to Santa Monica and take a walk on the pier.

83
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,880
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

84
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,219
I'll be home before it gets dark.

85
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,056
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I'm not afraid of anything.

86
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,726
I know. I know.

87
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,814
Be good.

88
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,566
I love you.

89
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,353
We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio.

90
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,898
He says he needs to
speak to somebody in charge.

91
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,610
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

92
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,737
- Number, please.
- Number, please.

93
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,072
Go ahead, please.

94
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,118
All right, get me the Omaha routing station.

95
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,621
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

96
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,289
Let's get this console running, now.

97
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,922
Christine. Good, I was hoping to catch you.

98
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,382
Look, I've been following your work reports,

99
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,635
and I just want to
let you know that I am very impressed.

100
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,137
When I first suggested hiring
female supervisors,

101
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,805
my superiors weren't big on the idea.

102
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,725
But you have held your own
as well as any of your male counterparts.

103
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,394
- Thank you, Mr. Harris.
- Ben, please. Listen, I...

104
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,604
Listen, the point is,

105
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,482
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

106
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,526
And if you're interested in the job,
I could write a report, or...

107
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,445
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

108
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,447
Okay, good, so maybe we could...

109
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
- Could we speak about it Monday?
- Yeah, absolutely.

110
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,868
Would that be all right?
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

111
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,253
Please!

112
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,131
Please.

113
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,248
Walter.

114
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,334
Honey?

115
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,629
Walter.

116
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,256
Walter!

117
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,633
Honey?

118
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,317
Walter?

119
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,866
Honey!

120
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,287
Walter!

121
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,915
Walter, it's time to come in, honey.

122
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,713
Suzie? Have you seen Walter?

123
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,925
- No, Mrs. Collins.
- Sorry.

124
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,728
Walter?

125
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,483
Walter.

126
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,841
Number, please.

127
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,968
May I please have the police station?

128
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,553
I'll connect you.

129
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,515
- Lincoln Heights Division.
- Hello, my name is Christine Collins.

130
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,142
I live at 210 North Avenue, 23.

131
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,605
And I'm calling to report
a missing child. Missing child.

132
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,733
What's your relation to the child, ma'am?

133
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,235
It's my son.

134
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,529
How long has he been gone?

135
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,989
I'm not sure. I just got home from work.

136
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,203
It could be since this morning
or it could be just the last hour.

137
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,454
Have you checked
around the neighborhood?

138
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,206
Yes, of course I did.

139
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,375
Well, maybe he's lost track of time.

140
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,709
No. No, no.

141
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,213
He always
stays around the house when it gets dark.

142
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,340
Would you please send
someone down here?

143
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm sorry, but our policy is that

144
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,846
we don't dispatch units
on missing child cases for 24 hours.

145
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,181
What?

146
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,726
Look, 99 times out of 100,
the kid shows up by morning.

147
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,689
We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.

148
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,857
No, no, no.

149
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,568
No, that's not Walter. He doesn't do that.

150
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:02,197
With all due respect, ma'am,
every parent who calls says the same thing.

151
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,117
Please, please.

152
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,827
Look, there's nothing I can do.

153
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,328
I'll take your name and your information,

154
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,039
but that's all until the morning,
at the earliest.

155
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,334
I'm sure he'll show up by then.
They always do.

156
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,406
Are you Mrs. Collins?

157
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:05,135
Our thoughts go out again today
to Mrs. Christine Collins of Lincoln Heights,

158
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,973
whose young son, Walter Collins,
disappeared nearly two weeks ago.

159
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,645
Though she is not
a member of our congregation,

160
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,315
we pray for her today as we have every day,

161
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,610
since we learned of her plight.

162
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,571
On the radio and in the newspapers

163
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,574
we are told that
the Los Angeles Police Department

164
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,162
is doing its very best
to reunite mother and child,

165
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,623
and I'm sure that that is true.

166
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,879
But given its status
as the most violent, corrupt

167
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,923
and incompetent police department

168
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,259
this side of the Rocky Mountains

169
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,804
I am not sure it's saying a great deal.

170
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,773
Every day, new bodies
appear along Mulholland

171
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,817
and in the ditches of our cities,

172
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:08,282
the work of Police Chief James Davis
and his aptly named Gun Squad.

173
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,785
Every day, the needs of honest citizens

174
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,831
are put second to greed and personal gain.

175
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:22,629
Every day,
this city sinks deeper into a cesspool

176
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:27,467
of fear, intimidation and corruption.

177
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,970
Once the City of Angels,

178
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:35,142
Los Angeles has become
a place where our protectors

179
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,686
have become our brutalizers.

180
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,691
Where to be the law is to be above the law.

181
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,950
I understand. Thank you.
I will call back in a few weeks.

182
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,286
Thank you very much.

183
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,917
Las Vegas Missing Persons Department?

184
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,211
Hello, this is Christine Collins.

185
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,089
I'm calling to see
if you've found any missing or lost children

186
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,093
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

187
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,597
Oh, all right. Well, please do. Please do call.

188
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,599
And I'll call back in a matter...

189
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,144
In a week, if that's all right.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

190
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,453
$2.

191
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,382
Hell, I think I left my wallet at home.

192
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,342
Can I owe it to you?

193
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,555
No credit. Pay up or I call the cops.

194
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,473
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

195
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,975
I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.

196
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,519
I just left my wallet at home, that's all.

197
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,564
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

198
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,902
Got collateral?

199
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,740
You can't ask for better collateral
than a man's own flesh and blood, right?

200
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,952
Now, you stay here, son. I'll be right back.

201
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,538
- But...
- Now, don't give me any trouble.

202
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,665
He's a good man to trust us like this.

203
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,253
Now, you just stay here
and I'll go back and get my wallet.

204
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,009
Ten minutes, then I call the cops.

205
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,687
Ah, hell.

206
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,235
- Number, please.
- Hello, Myrtle?

207
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,070
- Hello?
- Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.

208
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,238
Oh, hi, Harve.

209
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,282
- Would you get me Sheriff Larsen?
- Sure thing.

210
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,036
You have a nice day, too.

211
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,541
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

212
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,460
I can't seem to get through.

213
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,962
I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.

214
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,302
You have
a person to person call, Fairfax 2231.

215
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,888
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

216
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,723
I'll connect you right away, ma'am.

217
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,099
Thanks.

218
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,449
- Mrs. Collins?
-  Yes.

219
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,245
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

220
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,833
My office supervises
all runaway and missing child cases,

221
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,793
including your son's, and...

222
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,420
He's alive, Mrs. Collins.

223
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,261
He was picked up two days ago
by local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

224
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,762
He's safe and unhurt.

225
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,016
He was in the company of some drifter.

226
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,352
We have an APB out for him, but he's safe.

227
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,356
Thank you so much.

228
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,650
Oh, Christine...

229
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,362
That is so great.

230
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,288
Thank you.

231
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,639
There's so much press.

232
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,726
Yours is a story
with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins.

233
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,978
People love happy endings.

234
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,398
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

235
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,902
Back, boys. Back.

236
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,070
Thanks. Thanks, boys, thanks!

237
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,614
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,

238
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,575
but the important thing right now
is to reunite this little lady with her son,

239
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,035
so if you'll excuse us.

240
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,332
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

241
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,500
Easy, easy.

242
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,922
Mrs. Collins,
I'd like to introduce you to James E. Davis,

243
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,257
- Chief of Police.
- Very nice to meet you.

244
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,344
We don't get a lot of positive attention
from the boys in the press these days,

245
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,846
so it's good to be here
with a positive story, don't you think?

246
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,972
Yes, sir.

247
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,393
I take it you've been treated well
by my boys in the department?

248
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,939
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,
and I thought that maybe that was a...

249
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,440
Technicalities aside.

250
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,861
- It was wonderful.
- Well, good.

251
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,782
Then you won't
have any trouble telling that to the press,

252
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,742
and the fact that the LAPD...

253
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,373
Women. Hold on a second.

254
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,341
Back, boys, back.

255
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,344
Keep them back.

256
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,783
Well, aren't you... Aren't you gonna...

257
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,118
That's not my son.

258
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,580
What?

259
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,125
What are you saying?

260
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,168
It's not my son.

261
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,587
Well, I'm sure you're mistaken.

262
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:20,797
I'm not mistaken.

263
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,508
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

264
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,677
He's lost weight, he's changed.

265
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,387
I would know my own son.

266
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,265
All I'm saying is you're in shock
and he's changed.

267
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,852
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

268
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,603
Walter Collins.

269
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,315
It's a common name.

270
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,526
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

271
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,198
I live at 210 Avenue 23,
Los Angeles, California.

272
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,159
And that's my mommy!

273
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,292
Mrs. Collins, listen to me. I understand.

274
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,378
You're feeling a little uncertain right now,
and that's to be expected.

275
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,797
A boy this age, he changes so fast.

276
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,800
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

277
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,803
And there's no question
that this is your son.

278
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,972
That is not Walter.

279
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,143
It's not Walter as you remember him.

280
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,814
And that's why it's important
for you to take him home on a trial basis.

281
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,902
- A trial basis?
- Yes, yes.

282
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,530
Once he's around his familiar surroundings,

283
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,534
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

284
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,287
you will see that this is your Walter.

285
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,998
Now, I promise you,
I swear to you, I give you my word.

286
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,708
This is your son.

287
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,585
Now, if you have any problems,
any problems at all,

288
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,337
you come and you talk to me.

289
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,797
I'll take care of it.

290
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,717
I give you my word. Trust me.

291
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,846
Mrs. Collins, he has nowhere else to go.

292
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,810
Please.

293
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,900
Maybe I'm not thinking clearly.

294
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,860
And...

295
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,446
All right.

296
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,032
All right,
you're not thinking clearly, that's right.

297
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,534
Here we go!

298
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,369
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,871
Here, just turn around here.

300
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,623
How does it feel
to have your son home, Mrs. Collins?

301
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,708
What'd you think
when you saw him for the first time?

302
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,086
It's hard to explain.

303
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,963
She was shocked at first.

304
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,007
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

305
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,467
He's been through quite an ordeal.

306
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:30,969
How're you feeling, son?

307
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,137
Bet it feels great to be home.

308
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,471
Yeah. It's great.

309
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,849
The Los Angeles
Police Department is thankful

310
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,977
for all the hard work done
by the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

311
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,688
in making this joyful reunion possible.

312
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,482
The LAPD is dedicated
to serving the public at all times.

313
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,776
Can we get a photo
with mother and son, Captain?

314
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,404
Absolutely! Here we are.

315
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,197
Like that. Like that.

316
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,908
Squeeze together. There you go, boys.

317
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,536
- This way, Walter.
- Big smile.

318
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,705
- One more, please.
- That's a good one.

319
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,249
One more.

320
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,063
The sandwich all right?

321
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,194
- Would you like some more milk?
- No.

322
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,615
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

323
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:44,000
You're covered in soot from the train.
You should take a bath.

324
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,889
Pajamas are on the edge of the bed.

325
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,560
You okay? You all right?

326
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,646
I fell. Stupid tub!

327
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,148
That's all right.

328
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,569
You're circumcised.

329
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,409
Get out.

330
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,912
Move.

331
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:36,261
Last time I measured Walter,
last time I measured my son,

332
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,429
he was inches taller than you are now.

333
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,765
Who are you?

334
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,018
What are you doing here?

335
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,604
Who are you?

336
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,357
Who are you?

337
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,539
- He's not my son.
- Mrs. Collins...

338
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,041
No, I don't know why he's saying that he is,

339
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,876
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

340
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,962
I thought we agreed
to give him time to adjust.

341
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,714
He's three inches shorter.

342
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,465
I measured him on the chart.

343
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,883
Well, maybe your measurements are off.

344
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,886
Look, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation for all of this.

345
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,305
He's circumcised.

346
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,724
And Walter isn't.

347
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,059
Mrs. Collins.

348
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,481
Your son was missing for five months.

349
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:35,069
For at least part of that time in the company
of an as yet unidentified drifter.

350
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,989
Who knows what such
a disturbed individual might have done?

351
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,868
He could have
had him circumcised. He could have...

352
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,745
Made him shorter?

353
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,709
Why aren't you listening to me?

354
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,754
I am listening, damn it, I am listening.

355
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,380
And I understand your feelings.

356
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,591
He's changed, no mistake, and that's...

357
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,301
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

358
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,262
and that's why he needs
your love and support to bounce back.

359
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,972
He's not my son!

360
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,310
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?
Why are you doing this?

361
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,438
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

362
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,899
Your job pays you enough
to attend to his personal needs,

363
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,692
so I don't understand
why you're running away

364
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,569
from your responsibilities as a mother.

365
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
I am not running away from anything!

366
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,448
Least of all my responsibilities!

367
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,952
I am even taking care of that boy right now,
because I am all he has!

368
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,372
What worries me is
that you have stopped looking for my son!

369
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,626
Why should we be
looking for someone we've already found?

370
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,463
Because you have not found him.

371
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,965
His identity has been confirmed

372
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,552
by the best minds
in the field of child identification,

373
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,805
people who know what they're doing.

374
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,390
And I don't?

375
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,992
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,746
I appreciate everything that
this department has done

377
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,915
and I know how hard you're working.

378
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,085
I really do,
and I don't want to cause any trouble.

379
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:19,173
I just... There has been a terrible mistake,
and I need you to help me correct it,

380
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:23,845
so I can find my son before it's too late.

381
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,598
Please.

382
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:40,111
I won't take up anymore of your time.
I'm sorry I got upset.

383
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,113
I'm sorry, very sorry.

384
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,835
Yes, Captain?

385
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,088
- Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,470
- Mrs. Collins?
- Yes?

387
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,264
Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain Jones sent me.

388
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,766
I consult with him
from time to time on juvenile cases.

389
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,353
- May I come in?
- Yes, thank you for coming.

390
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,272
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

391
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,817
Well, I'm here now,
and we'll put all that to rights.

392
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,612
Where's the boy?

393
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,324
Ah!

394
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,950
There he is.

395
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,328
A handsome young man.

396
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,872
He has your eyes, doesn't he?

397
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,374
And a little bit of the nose.

398
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,669
Very fit, in spite of all his travails.

399
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:42,006
A very resilient boy
you've got here, Mrs. Collins.

400
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,177
- I thought you were here to help me.
- Well, I am.

401
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,680
Captain Jones said that the boy had been
through some severe physical changes

402
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,349
and asked me to drop in on him

403
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,018
to reassure you
in your time of motherly concern.

404
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,440
My motherly concern is not for him
because he's not my son.

405
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:04,695
Now, statements like that
will hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

406
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,197
now will they?

407
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,201
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

408
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,203
Yes.

409
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,539
Come.

410
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,376
Against the wall.

411
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,381
He's three inches shorter.

412
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,299
Ah.

413
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,801
Well...

414
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,555
Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.

415
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,892
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

416
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:39,730
Given the stress of the past five months,
his spine may have actually shrunk.

417
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,733
It's uncommon,
but it's within the realm of possibility.

418
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,988
And circumcision?

419
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,078
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

420
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,248
After all, circumcision is hygienically sound.

421
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,252
Must have been quite traumatic at the time.

422
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,256
No wonder he's submerged the memory.

423
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,801
I...

424
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:13,472
You see, there's a perfectly
sound medical explanation for all of this.

425
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,475
But it's right for you to raise the questions.

426
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,687
You need to be apprised
of all changes the lad went through

427
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,814
during his absence.

428
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,151
Wouldn't I know
whether or not he's my son?

429
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm the mother.

430
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,656
Which means
you're in no position to be objective.

431
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,953
You are looking through the prism
of extreme emotion at a boy

432
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,289
who has changed from what you remember.

433
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,458
He isn't the same boy that left here.

434
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,627
Just as a boy
that goes off to war and then returns

435
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,503
is not the same anymore.

436
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,300
And a mother's heart,
driven by intuition and emotion,

437
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,802
sees these changes and rebels,

438
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,014
insists that this isn't your son.

439
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,559
Doesn't change the facts.

440
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,317
I'm willing to put my theory
to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

441
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,486
Are you?

442
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,870
It is absolutely outrageous!

443
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,831
Calm yourself,
calm yourself and just listen to me.

444
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:25,002
No, no, no. No, you listen to me, please.

445
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,507
This so-called doctor
paraded me around my own neighborhood,

446
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,927
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

447
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,012
And what was his findings?

448
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,348
He found what he expected to find,

449
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,018
what you obviously told him he would find.

450
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,520
- Mrs. Collins.
- But that's not...

451
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,271
That's nothing to be embarrassed about.

452
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:48,526
That I was embarrassed is not the issue.

453
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:57,201
The point is that you are wasting time
when you should be looking for my son.

454
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,121
But the report is final, Mrs. Collins.

455
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,542
Well, then I want to receive the report,
so I can refute it,

456
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,460
before it goes to anyone else.

457
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,795
Fine.

458
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,965
Yes. Good day.

459
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,309
I'm finished. Could I go to my room now?

460
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,895
Yes.

461
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,073
Good night, Mommy.

462
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,785
Stop saying that!

463
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,330
Stop saying that!

464
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,499
I'm not your mother!

465
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,130
I want my son back.

466
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,842
You're not him. You're not my son!

467
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,723
I want my son back.

468
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,350
I want my son back!

469
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,269
Damn you!

470
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,773
I want my son back!

471
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,225
I was wrong to yell at you.

472
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,979
You're just a child

473
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,234
and I don't think
you know what you're doing,

474
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,277
and the hurt you're causing.

475
00:35:55,362 --> 00:36:00,825
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

476
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,079
He's all I have.

477
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:11,418
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

478
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,839
you and I,

479
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,134
we both know the truth, don't we?

480
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,514
We both know that you're not Walter.

481
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,560
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

482
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,728
so they can find my son.

483
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,441
Please.

484
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,909
We can talk tomorrow.

485
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,891
Hello?

486
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,727
- Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?
- Yes.

487
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,313
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

488
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,733
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.

489
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,028
Oh, yes, I've heard your broadcasts.

490
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,654
I'm...

491
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,615
Thank you.

492
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,242
Have you read the Times this morning?

493
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,911
No.

494
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:31,165
Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish

495
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,293
for breakfast, in, say, an hour.
I think we should meet.

496
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,130
Hello?

497
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,140
"Mysterious case of...

498
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,559
"Acting on the request
of the Los Angeles Police Department,

499
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:54,813
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist,
examined Walter Collins

500
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,690
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,

501
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,401
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition

502
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,862
"noticed since the return of the boy
to his mother last Monday."

503
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,076
Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it?

504
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,162
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.

505
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,998
Now, not only does
that clearly state you're the boy's mother,

506
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:17,419
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.

507
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,880
And that the police department is concerned

508
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,633
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.

509
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,219
You should try the eggs. They're very nice.

510
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,515
"'I examined the boy
quite thoroughly, ' Dr. Tarr said,

511
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,017
"'And it's clear that he has something to tell.

512
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,477
"'I'm sure that in time..."'

513
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,690
...time he will give
his boyish story of the entire affair,

514
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,526
but not until he has faith in his listener.

515
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,613
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

516
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,867
Course of my examination,
I found nothing to dispute the findings

517
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,744
of the LAPD.

518
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,164
Why would they do this?

519
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:58,919
To avoid admitting they made a mistake
when they brought back the wrong boy.

520
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,672
Of course, anyone
reading the newspaper with half a brain

521
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,841
would see through it instantly.

522
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,928
Sadly, that would exclude
about half the readership of the Times.

523
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:13,017
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things

524
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,603
the LAPD wish none of us ever knew about.

525
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,776
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

526
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,281
When Chief Davis
took over the force two years ago, he said...

527
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,701
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

528
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,704
I want them brought in dead, not alive,

529
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,624
and I will reprimand any officer
who shows the least mercy to a criminal.

530
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,128
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,

531
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,798
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

532
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,301
He called them the Gun Squad.

533
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,723
No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.

534
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,975
Just piles of bodies.

535
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,978
Bodies in the morgues,
bodies in the hospitals,

536
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,646
bodies by the side of the road.

537
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:04,151
And not because the
LAPD wanted to wipe out crime. No.

538
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,738
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.

539
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,823
Mayor Cryer and half the force
are on the take.

540
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,077
Gambling, prostitution,
bootlegging, you name it.

541
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,413
Because once you give people
the freedom to do whatever they want,

542
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:21,251
as the Lord found in the Garden of Eden,
they will do exactly that.

543
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:25,172
This police department
does not tolerate dissent, or contradiction,

544
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,674
or even embarrassment.

545
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:32,513
And you are in a position to embarrass them
and they do not like it.

546
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,432
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.

547
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:39,103
I've seen that happen
too many times to start going blind now.

548
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,188
That's why I wanted to meet you,

549
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,108
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into

550
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,694
and to help you fight it, if you choose to.

551
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,030
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing

552
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:54,451
and everything that you said,

553
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,620
but I'm not on a mission.

554
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,705
I just want my son home.

555
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,960
Mrs. Collins, a lot of mothers' sons

556
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,213
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.

557
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,549
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

558
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,177
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

559
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:25,065
He had two cavities that needed filling.
He put up a fight, but I took care of it.

560
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,400
And?

561
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,070
Your son's upper front teeth were separated
by a small tissue, a diastema.

562
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,656
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

563
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,159
The boy in that room has no such gap.

564
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,494
Can that change with age?
Because that's what they're gonna say.

565
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,996
In some cases, yes, it's possible.

566
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,332
But the tissue between
Walter's teeth prevents that from happening.

567
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,752
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

568
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:49,590
and I can tell you right now
that he has never had such an operation.

569
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,010
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?

570
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,846
Pardon my language, but hell yes.

571
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,767
Sounds like the anaesthetic's wearing off.

572
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,188
On the other hand,
maybe I'll write that letter first.

573
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,441
Give the little fella
something to think about.

574
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,203
Well, if it is, he's changed enormously.

575
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,539
- Do you know who I am?
- You're a teacher.

576
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,792
Yes, but even teachers have names.
What's mine?

577
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,545
I don't remember.

578
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,632
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.

579
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,052
Mrs. Fox. Now, take your seat.

580
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,154
I didn't say take a seat.
I said take your seat, the one assigned you.

581
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,825
You must know where it is,
you've been sitting in it for over a year now.

582
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,587
Mrs. Collins, if that's your son,
I'll eat my yardstick.

583
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,007
Not only will I put it in writing,
I will testify to it in a court of law

584
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,886
or to the President Calvin Coolidge himself
if I have to.

585
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,180
Thank you.

586
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,102
I'll see you tonight for the broadcast.

587
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,520
Good luck.

588
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,989
Quick question, ma'am.

589
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,240
Quick question!

590
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,033
Mrs. Collins.

591
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,370
Hello. My name is Christine Collins.

592
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,622
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

593
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:50,294
On March 10th, my nine-year-old son,
Walter Collins, disappeared.

594
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,087
And a five-month investigation

595
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:56,383
led to a boy being brought
to Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

596
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,595
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

597
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,556
He was not my son.

598
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,516
The LAPD made a mistake,

599
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,270
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

600
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,856
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

601
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,275
all confirming that he is not my son.

602
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,529
I'm having them reprinted now,
and I'll have them for you tomorrow.

603
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,074
I have given the LAPD
every opportunity to admit their mistake

604
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,285
and renew the search for my son.

605
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:28,290
Since they have refused to do so,
it has forced me to bring my case public.

606
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:32,127
And I hope that this now will persuade them
to finish what they started

607
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,796
and bring my son home to me.

608
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,256
Thank you very much.

609
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,771
Morelli!

610
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,732
I want you to find the Collins woman
and get her here.

611
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,152
- And, Bill, bring her in the back way.
- Yes, sir.

612
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,664
This way, miss.

613
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:11,833
Why are we going in the back?

614
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,628
Captain's orders.
Front's jammed with reporters.

615
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,302
Please, sit down, miss.
Captain Jones'll be right with you.

616
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,681
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

617
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,016
What'd they do, lose a moose?

618
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,353
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

619
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,689
He's living with his cousin on some ranch
near Riverside, in Wineville.

620
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,858
- You want it?
- I'll take it. Got nothing better to do.

621
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,527
You're a prince.

622
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,489
Mrs. Collins.

623
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,700
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

624
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,165
Sit.

625
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,710
You've caused us
quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

626
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,212
This situation
has become an embarrassment

627
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,713
for the entire police department.

628
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,298
It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.

629
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,842
No, of course not.

630
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:05,554
You just told the papers we couldn't tell
one boy from another as a compliment

631
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,889
for the months we spent
working on your case.

632
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,350
You trying to make fools out of us?
Is that it? You enjoy this?

633
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,854
Of course not. I want you to find my son.

634
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,689
You know
what your problem is, Mrs. Collins?

635
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,691
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

636
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,900
What?

637
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,235
You enjoyed being
a free woman, didn't you?

638
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,821
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

639
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,740
You could go where you wanted,
do whatever you wanted,

640
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,659
see anyone you wanted.

641
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,203
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

642
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,539
And now he's an inconvenience to you.

643
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,375
And that's why you cooked up this scheme,

644
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,253
to throw him to the state
and get the state to raise him for you.

645
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,088
- Isn't that true?
- That is not true!

646
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,884
No? Well, even the boy says he's your son.
Why would he say that?

647
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,679
- How would he know to do that?
- I don't know. I just know he's lying.

648
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,056
Oh, maybe so. Maybe he is a liar.

649
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,392
But that's how he's been trained, isn't it?

650
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,394
Lying was born in both of you.

651
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,438
You're a liar and a troublemaker
and, if you ask me,

652
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,565
you got no business
walking the streets of Los Angeles.

653
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,691
Now wait a minute.

654
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,568
Because either you know you're lying,

655
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:05,405
or you're not capable of knowing
if you're lying or telling the truth.

656
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,073
So, which is it?

657
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,952
You a derelict mother? Or just plain nuts?

658
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,246
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

659
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,623
I'm not gonna sit here and take this.

660
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,000
You want experts?
You want doctors? I have a few of my own.

661
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,293
Matron.

662
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:26,134
Mrs. Collins, you still insist
that the boy out there is not your son?

663
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,511
Yes, I do.

664
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,307
- Please, don't struggle.
- What?

665
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
- No!
- You'll only hurt yourself.

666
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,935
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

667
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,520
You can't just do this. No, you can't.

668
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,771
You are to convey the prisoner

669
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,940
to the Los Angeles County
General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

670
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,149
What?

671
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,318
You are to make the following entry.

672
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,029
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,

673
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,656
and that we have given her a boy and tried

674
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,492
to make her think
it is her son when she says it is not.

675
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,662
- Take her away.
- No. No, no.

676
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,290
- Please. Please.
- Come on, Mrs. Collins.

677
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,793
- No. No.
- This way.

678
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,677
Mrs. Collins has been known to us
since about March 10th, 1928

679
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,555
when she reported
her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.

680
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,349
- The boy was gone until August 1928.
- Okay.

681
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:18,186
Since his return,
she has complained that he is still missing

682
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,022
and has made repeated requests
that he be found.

683
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,484
She suffers from paranoia,
delusions of persecution

684
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,903
and dislocation from reality.

685
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,698
She may be a threat to herself or others.

686
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,368
We recommend that
she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward

687
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,328
until her senses can be restored.

688
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,663
Got another code 12.

689
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,915
- Name?
- Collins. Christine.

690
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,500
No, no, no, listen, this is a mistake.

691
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:41,710
Certifying officer?

692
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,379
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

693
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,381
No, no, please!
Please! The police are trying to punish me...

694
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,592
If you keep it up,
I'm gonna have to put you in a straitjacket.

695
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,052
- Do you want that?
- No, ma'am.

696
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,513
Then behave yourself. Code 12.

697
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,224
I'm not mad!

698
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,684
Please.

699
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,854
Oh, God.

700
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,147
All right.

701
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,737
No!

702
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,872
Stop!

703
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,755
Spread your legs.

704
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,298
What?

705
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,428
Wider.

706
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,096
Oh.

707
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,777
I'm not sick!

708
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,493
Touch me! Touch me!

709
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,081
Inside. This is your room.

710
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,249
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

711
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,502
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

712
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:06,753
Sorry.

713
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:11,633
My room! No. No, no, no, this is my room.

714
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,009
Can I make a phone call?

715
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,095
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.

716
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,848
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

717
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,350
- This is for your own good.
- Help me!

718
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,018
Listen to me.

719
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,978
My room.

720
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,690
No, this is my room.

721
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,983
Oh, God!

722
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,527
My room.

723
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,948
No, no, this is my room.

724
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,285
My room.

725
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,958
My room! My room! My room!

726
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,460
My room!

727
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,380
They said it was my room!

728
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,394
You have a problem?

729
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,856
Overheated, that's all. She'll be fine in a bit.

730
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,692
Hey, listen, could you give me a hand?

731
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,571
I'm trying to find a place
called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

732
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,866
Northcott Ranch, huh?

733
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,495
Uh...

734
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,497
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,584
You're almost there.

736
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:33,882
You just... You just follow this road west,
about two, no, three miles.

737
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,468
And then you take that next right.

738
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,221
And you stay on that
and it will bring you right to it.

739
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,227
- Is something going on out there?
- No.

740
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,897
Just looking into a juvenile matter.

741
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,900
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

742
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,114
Hello?

743
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,871
Hey!

744
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,373
Hey! Hey!

745
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,543
Come here! Come here!

746
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,717
This is the police!

747
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,178
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.

748
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,891
Open the door or stand aside.

749
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,382
Hey! Stop!

750
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,803
Stop! Stop it!

751
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,139
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!

752
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,141
- Stop it!
- Fine!

753
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,644
Give me your hands.

754
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,905
Come on. Sit down.

755
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,658
Jesus!

756
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,246
What the hell is wrong with you, kid? Huh?

757
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,081
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?

758
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,667
What difference does it make?

759
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:43,923
We're just sending you back to Canada, son.
It isn't the end of the world.

760
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,009
What?

761
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:51,431
Well, you can't stay in the US
as long as you want, pal.

762
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,687
No word from Mrs. Collins?

763
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,188
We haven't heard from her.

764
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,274
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

765
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,026
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

766
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,278
- Find out what they know.
- Absolutely.

767
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,364
And now KGF
welcomes the Reverend Gustav Briegleb

768
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,616
of St. Paul's Presbyterian.

769
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:15,121
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

770
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,041
bringing you the Lord's word on Radio KGF.

771
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,792
Good evening.

772
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:24,130
I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight,
but apparently she has been delayed.

773
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,217
And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,

774
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,887
I'll have to fill in as best I can.

775
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,555
I'm going to tell you what happened

776
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,060
and I'm going to
keep on telling you every night, right here,

777
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,229
until somebody does something about it.

778
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,070
The Desert Local,
train number 45,

779
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,406
will be arriving on track two in five minutes.

780
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,159
Hello. I'd like a ticket to Canada.

781
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,411
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

782
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,497
I don't have anything going that far tonight.

783
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,749
The best I can do is
put you on a train to Seattle.

784
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,585
From there you can transfer to a local
or drive across the border.

785
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,087
That would be fine.

786
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,589
- Roundtrip?
- One way.

787
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,925
- That'll be $15.
- Right.

788
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,430
There you go.

789
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:18,017
- Thank you. There you go. Enjoy your trip.
- I will.

790
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,953
Breakfast is half an hour.

791
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,876
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.

792
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:48,965
The dining room is down the hall.
The doctor will call for you when he's ready.

793
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,645
Do you want eggs or oatmeal?

794
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,149
Okay, that's everyone that's here.

795
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,567
All right.

796
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,485
You can pull the oatmeal.

797
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,903
Do you want it for tomorrow?

798
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,321
- You know, just dump it.
- All right.

799
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,990
You should eat.

800
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,659
Eating is normal.

801
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,579
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.

802
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,080
It's the only chance you got.

803
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,331
I'm not hungry.

804
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,667
- Barbara, you have to eat now.
- I'm not hungry.

805
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,920
My name's Carol Dexter. What's yours?

806
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,922
Christine. Christine Collins.

807
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,177
Now, finish it all.
I know it's hard, but you gotta try.

808
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,511
Oh, boy.

809
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,103
I heard them talking.

810
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,230
You're here on code 12?

811
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,982
Police action.

812
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,068
I mean, the doctors, the staff, they figure
that if the police brought you here,

813
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,070
there must be a good reason for it.

814
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,615
There isn't a good reason for it.

815
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,327
I'm perfectly sane
and I will explain that to them.

816
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,120
How?

817
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,958
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

818
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,837
If you smile too much,
you're delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

819
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,673
And if you don't smile, you're depressed.

820
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,300
If you remain neutral,

821
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,887
you're emotionally withdrawn,
potentially catatonic.

822
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,561
- You've given this a lot of thought.
- Yeah, I have. Don't you get it?

823
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,814
You're a code 12, so am I.

824
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,108
We're here for the exact same reasons.

825
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,319
We both pissed off the cops.

826
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:37,156
Now, you see that lady there?

827
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,784
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

828
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,870
When she tried to tell somebody about it,
he brought her here.

829
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,205
I want more juice.

830
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,498
And that one?

831
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,874
Put your tray back
where it belongs.

832
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,128
The police beat the crap out of her brother,
broke both his arms.

833
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,006
When she tried to tell the papers...

834
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,385
And you?

835
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,722
I work nights.

836
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,849
Sure.

837
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:08,020
I mean, I work nights.

838
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,773
Oh.

839
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,150
- Yeah. In the clubs. Downtown.
- I'm sorry.

840
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:17,071
Yeah, well, this one client just kept
hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

841
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,156
so I filed a complaint.

842
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,701
And it turns out he was a cop.

843
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,869
Next thing I know, I'm here.

844
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,832
- But they can't do that.
- Are you kidding?

845
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,250
All right,
one more and then that's it.

846
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:32,044
Everybody knows women are fragile.

847
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:35,172
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

848
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,924
Somebody! Help me!

849
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,719
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,

850
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,262
they just go fucking nuts.

851
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,680
Pardon my French.

852
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,265
- You gotta get those dishes.
- You got it.

853
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:48,060
If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us.

854
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,022
I mean, who are you gonna believe,

855
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:54,358
some crazy woman
trying to destroy the integrity of the force,

856
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,235
or a police officer?

857
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:01,032
Then once they get us in here,
we either shut up and we learn to behave,

858
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,742
or we don't go home.

859
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,577
Are you all done?

860
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,747
Or we go home like that.

861
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:47,787
Stop. Stop it.

862
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,956
Stop it!

863
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,291
Please.

864
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,128
Clark.

865
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,631
Sanford Clark?

866
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,633
Here.

867
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,636
Paperwork's come through.

868
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,138
You'll be deported back to Canada
day after tomorrow.

869
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,432
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

870
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,977
I hope your stay here has convinced you
not to try crossing the border

871
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,771
illegally in the future.

872
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,980
Wait!

873
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,319
I'd like to talk to the officer
who brought me in.

874
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,154
I'm sure he has far more important things...

875
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,573
Please. It's important.

876
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,082
Christine Collins.

877
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,835
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

878
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,506
Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.

879
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,684
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

880
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,519
Yes.

881
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,354
Really?

882
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,860
I'd think it'd be quite difficult at first.

883
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,820
Yes, it was.

884
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:06,699
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

885
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:20,379
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

886
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,382
The Wassermann test.

887
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,553
They said it was to check for syphilis,
'cause it affects the mind.

888
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,515
The idea that someone
thinks you need to be checked for syphilis,

889
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,517
does that upset you?

890
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,853
No, they said it was standard procedure,
so it did not.

891
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,355
Yes, exactly. Standard procedure.

892
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,232
We have to cover all our bases.

893
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:44,028
I can imagine

894
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,739
that for some people
that would be uncomfortable,

895
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,949
but I understood.

896
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:12,806
According to your file
you believe that the police substituted

897
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:15,059
a fake boy for your son.

898
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,311
No, I didn't say he was a fake boy.

899
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,480
He's not my boy.

900
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,981
They brought home the wrong boy.

901
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,150
My son is still missing.

902
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:28,113
Well, that's strange,
because I have here a newspaper article

903
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:34,119
with a photo of you at the train station,
welcoming home your son.

904
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,793
- That is you in the photo, isn't it?
- Yes.

905
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,587
- Yeah.
- Yes.

906
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:46,674
So, at first he was your son,

907
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,302
and now he's not your son.

908
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,889
Has this been
going on for a long time?

909
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:57,518
People changing, becoming something
other than what they are?

910
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,436
People don't change.

911
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,146
You don't think people change?

912
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,273
No, that's not...

913
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,821
The police,
they're not out to persecute you?

914
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,614
- No, they're not.
- No, they're not.

915
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,784
The police are here to protect you.

916
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,953
Yes.

917
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,205
- Really?
- Yes.

918
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:24,128
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,

919
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:31,218
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

920
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:35,723
So, either the head nurse and the interns
are also conspiring to punish you

921
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,183
or you're changing your story.

922
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:50,487
Do you often have trouble
telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

923
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,033
No.

924
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:05,586
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

925
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,671
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

926
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:10,007
but the boy has been quite insistent.

927
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:14,219
It's all right. I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

928
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:17,097
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

929
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,516
so this had better be worth it.

930
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,602
You again, huh?

931
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,610
We'll see.

932
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,281
Well?

933
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,786
- This isn't easy, okay?
- Yeah?

934
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,790
Driving my ass here
in the pouring rain wasn't easy either.

935
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:48,962
My cousin is Gordon Northcott.
He owns the ranch where you found me.

936
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,927
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,

937
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,347
doing chores and stuff like that.

938
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:02,434
Said I could stay as long as I wanted to.

939
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,979
I thought that meant
I could leave whenever I wanted.

940
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,106
Mmm.

941
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,483
You saying that he held you prisoner?

942
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,776
Bull.

943
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,654
When I got there,
you were running around free as a jaybird.

944
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,448
- Could've left any time you wanted.
- No.

945
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,534
So, what's this, huh?

946
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,786
Some kind of story to
cover why you're in the country illegally?

947
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,954
No, it's nothing like that.

948
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,122
'Cause I don't have time for this, okay?

949
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,666
- Listen to me! He said...
- What?

950
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,459
What did he say?

951
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,796
He said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me.

952
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,966
Look, you don't understand what he's like,

953
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,553
what he...
What we did, what he made me do.

954
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:43,016
All right. Let's start at the beginning then.

955
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,481
What'd he make you do?

956
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,573
- We killed some kids.
- What?

957
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:01,326
Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.
He made me help him.

958
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,996
He said if I didn't, he'd kill me, too.

959
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,749
Look, you gotta help me, please.
I'm so scared.

960
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,835
I don't want to go to hell for killing kids.

961
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,253
Look.

962
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,173
What kids?
What... What are you talking about?

963
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,675
I don't know. I never knew their names.

964
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,888
Names? How many? How many kids?

965
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,431
All together?

966
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,604
About 20, I guess.

967
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,523
No, you're lying.

968
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,901
No! It's true, I swear!

969
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,694
You're gonna tell me you killed 20 kids?

970
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:39,198
Yeah! Thereabouts.

971
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,952
I stopped counting after a while.

972
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:51,543
Gordon said maybe
one or two may have escaped.

973
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,299
- But...
- No.

974
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,260
Nobody can just up and kill 20 kids, okay?

975
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,553
We did.

976
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,140
We did.

977
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,311
How?

978
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:13,982
Most times we'd just have one or two.

979
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,152
Sometimes as many as three.

980
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:23,075
I always knew
when we were getting ready to leave.

981
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,120
Clean up the car.

982
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,415
Make sure the tires were good.

983
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,126
Check the engine.

984
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:38,298
'Cause he was afraid
that the car would break down

985
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,844
and we'd get caught.

986
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,764
My loving baby

987
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:49,142
We'd always go a different
direction every time.

988
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,980
Never hit the same part of town twice.

989
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:56,441
Sometimes we'd just drive around for hours,

990
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,694
till we found somebody.

991
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,195
Well, there you are!

992
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,489
We've been looking for you like mad.

993
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,992
- You have?
- Sure thing.

994
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,995
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

995
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,123
And they sent us to come find you.
Now, they're hurt real bad.

996
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,209
The police took them to the hospital,
but they didn't have time to come find you,

997
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,086
so we said that we would do it.

998
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,671
Now, come on.

999
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,299
All right. Get in here. Hurry.

1000
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:23,719
Listen, we gotta get you to that hospital
so you can see your folks.

1001
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:27,014
See, a lot of kids
won't get in a car alone with a stranger,

1002
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,432
but when he's got a kid there...

1003
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:30,142
There's a good boy.

1004
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,602
Scoot over. Scoot over, San.

1005
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,103
...that made it easier.

1006
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,771
I want you to hold on tight.

1007
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,148
They'd look at me and say...

1008
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,441
We've got a long way to go.

1009
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:38,692
"Hey, if he's safe..."

1010
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:39,902
And we are gonna fly.

1011
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,279
"...I guess I will be, too."

1012
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,783
Every time they got in the truck,

1013
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,870
I just wanted to die.

1014
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:54,625
As soon as we got back to the ranch,
they went in the coop.

1015
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,378
You boys hungry? Huh?

1016
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,297
Watch the door, Sanford!

1017
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,382
Hey! Watch the door!

1018
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,053
What's the matter? I'm not gonna hurt you.

1019
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,764
Are you worried that I'm gonna hurt you?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1020
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,307
Huh? Come here.

1021
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,392
- No! No! No! No! Please!
- I would never hurt you.

1022
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,103
Some days he'd do them right off.

1023
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,942
Other days he'd wait,

1024
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,654
pick up a few more,

1025
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:26,740
until he had about four or five of them.

1026
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,450
Yeah.

1027
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,868
- No! No! No!
- No what?

1028
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,036
No what, huh?

1029
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:33,580
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1030
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,582
Sanford, keep your eye on that door!

1031
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,418
No! Please, no! No! No!

1032
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,880
No! No! No! No! Please! No! No!

1033
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:51,223
He'd sometimes leave just one or two
of them alive, barely, anyway.

1034
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:55,268
He'd say, "Finish them, San.

1035
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,772
"Finish them or...
Finish them or I'll finish you."

1036
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,943
And I did.

1037
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:10,742
And I killed them. And I did. I killed them.
Oh, God, I killed them!

1038
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,413
Oh, God!

1039
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:19,292
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

1040
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,836
Look at me.

1041
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,797
These kids.

1042
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:29,219
You think if you saw them again, you think
you might be able to recognize them?

1043
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,555
I don't know.

1044
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,181
Maybe.

1045
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,727
Hey, I haven't updated
these in a while, but still.

1046
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,646
Just...

1047
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,316
It should be. Just go through these, okay?

1048
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:52,617
If you see any you recognize,
just put them down on the table here.

1049
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:33,116
I'm sorry!

1050
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,751
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to... He made me.

1051
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,343
Oh, shit.

1052
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,848
This one. Look at me.

1053
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,269
You're sure?

1054
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,691
I'm sure.

1055
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,446
Jesus Christ.

1056
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:15,992
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1057
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,577
Jesus Christ.

1058
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,539
Son of a bitch.

1059
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,793
Oh, God.

1060
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:27,796
Well, he's lying.

1061
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,840
Have you gone soft in the head, Les?

1062
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,092
- Twenty kids, sir.
- He's playing you.

1063
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,845
He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up
with some cock and bull story

1064
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,930
about how he was forced
to stay in the country.

1065
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,975
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think so. You didn't see him.

1066
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,018
This kid, he's scared half out of his mind.

1067
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:45,188
He picked the Collins kid.
We found him, remember?

1068
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,565
Haven't you been reading the papers?

1069
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:50,694
- Or maybe you have, is that it?
- Sir, if you'd just listen to me...

1070
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:52,195
I'm sorry, Captain, but he's here again.

1071
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,072
- Who?
- That Reverend Briegleb.

1072
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:55,907
He's asking about Christine Collins.

1073
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,702
Well, you tell that son of a bitch
to get the hell off of police property,

1074
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,745
or I'll have him arrested
for disturbing the peace.

1075
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,748
I tried.
He said he won't leave, him or his friends.

1076
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,125
What?

1077
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,004
What the hell!

1078
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,299
Jesus!

1079
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,096
Jesus jumped down.

1080
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:20,223
Captain?

1081
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:21,766
- Ybarra?
- Yeah.

1082
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,436
Listen to me.
You're to do nothing except get back here.

1083
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,479
Sir, departmental policy requires that

1084
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,107
all allegations of homicide
have to be investigated.

1085
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:30,275
These are kids, for Christ sake.

1086
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,943
Departmental policy is what I say it is.

1087
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:35,280
Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass back
here with that kid, you got that?

1088
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:38,241
You don't talk to anybody
and you bring me that kid. You got it?

1089
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:39,492
Nobody!

1090
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,966
- Captain Jones.
- Boys.

1091
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,469
What the hell have you done
with Christine Collins?

1092
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,763
And don't try and lie your way out of it,

1093
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:04,559
because several of her neighbors
saw her being driven away in a police car.

1094
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,020
Mrs. Collins has been placed
in protective custody

1095
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,439
following a mental breakdown.

1096
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,108
A what?

1097
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:16,404
She's getting the best treatment available.
And that will be all.

1098
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,409
Next.

1099
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,869
- Go on. Move up.
- For what?

1100
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:24,913
- Medication.
- Medication for what?

1101
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,249
The kind that's good for you. Help you relax.

1102
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,375
- Well, I don't want to relax.
- Come on.

1103
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,085
- I'm not gonna take something...
- We can force-feed you

1104
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,503
- if that's what you want.
- I don't know what it is!

1105
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,255
- I don't know what it is. Dr. Steele?
- Take it. Orderly.

1106
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:34,965
- Dr. Steele?
- I understand. Come on.

1107
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,925
Ladies, keep moving. Come on.

1108
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,718
I don't wanna take anything
that I don't know what it is.

1109
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:40,929
There's nothing wrong with me
that I need medication.

1110
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,390
There's nothing wrong with you.

1111
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,560
- No, there's nothing wrong.
- No.

1112
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,729
- You're fine.
- Yes, I am.

1113
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:55,151
Well, then
you shouldn't have any trouble signing this.

1114
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,364
By signing it,
you certify that you were wrong

1115
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,325
when you stated the boy returned to you
by the police was not your son.

1116
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,828
It further stipulates
that the police were right

1117
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,871
in sending you here
for observation and it absolves them

1118
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,332
of all responsibility. Sign it.

1119
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,084
I won't sign that.

1120
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,336
I won't sign that.

1121
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:16,214
Well, then your condition is not improved.

1122
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,593
Sign it, and you can be
out of here first thing tomorrow morning.

1123
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,513
But I wasn't wrong.

1124
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,557
He's not my son. My son is still missing.

1125
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,310
Mrs. Collins, you're becoming agitated.

1126
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,480
Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing that,
because he's not my son!

1127
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,606
Orderly!

1128
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,066
- He's not my son!
- Orderly!

1129
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,526
My son is missing!

1130
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,070
- The patient is becoming hysterical!
- No! My son is missing!

1131
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,447
See to it she is sedated properly.

1132
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,490
- Get her out of here.
- No! No! No!

1133
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:43,950
- Next!
- No!

1134
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,453
- No, no!
- Orderly, hold on.

1135
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,207
Stop it!

1136
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,877
- No!
- Open your mouth. Open, open your mouth.

1137
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,545
- Easy!
- You got her?

1138
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,172
- God!
- Swallow it.

1139
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,715
Stop it!

1140
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,468
Move back.

1141
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,053
- You!
- Get her out of here!

1142
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,304
Come on, you got her?

1143
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,764
Stay out of this!
This is none of your business!

1144
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,223
This is police business! All of you!

1145
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:09,517
You'll stay out of it
if you know what's good for you!

1146
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,728
You'd think you were
in enough trouble with the law already,

1147
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,105
being a whore, wouldn't you?

1148
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:18,651
Attacking a staff member. Room 18.

1149
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:22,280
No, no! Stop it! No!

1150
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,491
No! No!

1151
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,452
No! Stop it!

1152
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,693
Come on, kid.

1153
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:05,300
I don't know.
I'm not sure. I think so. He was pretty close.

1154
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,718
Excuse me.

1155
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,304
- It's all right, I can take it from here.
- But I got...

1156
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,430
We need him for questioning.

1157
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,891
- Like I said, it was dark.
- Thanks. Come on.

1158
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,059
Brady, Ross.

1159
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,353
You've just been requisitioned for backup.
I'll explain on the way.

1160
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:18,813
Yes, sir.

1161
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,155
I'm not sure.

1162
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,241
She said she'd had the croup before.
This could be pneumonia.

1163
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:35,121
I keep telling her that,
and she doesn't want to.

1164
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:36,623
You have to insist.

1165
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,124
You shouldn't have done that.

1166
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,626
- Please, let me out!
- Get in there!

1167
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,002
Wanted to.

1168
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,004
Felt good.

1169
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:46,174
- Let me out! No! Please! No!
- You got her?

1170
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:50,637
I lost two babies to back alley doctors.

1171
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,014
No choice.

1172
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,187
Never had the chance to fight for them.

1173
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:01,773
You do.

1174
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,775
Don't stop.

1175
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,611
I won't.

1176
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,869
Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.

1177
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,124
That's not exactly language for a lady.

1178
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,335
Hell.

1179
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:27,048
There are times that's exactly
the right language to use.

1180
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,551
Yeah?

1181
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,180
When you've got nothing left to lose.

1182
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,516
You're not supposed to be here!

1183
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:37,892
Mmm. Mmm.

1184
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,252
Stay there. Check the house.
Check the barn.

1185
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,680
It's all clear.

1186
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,599
Clear here.

1187
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,601
Bring me that shovel.

1188
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,690
All right. Let's go.

1189
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,238
Come on.

1190
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,619
You're gonna show me.

1191
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:45,126
Come on. Show me.

1192
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,315
This it?

1193
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,818
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1194
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,406
Dig.

1195
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:22,455
You put them in the ground,
you can take them out of the ground.

1196
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,999
Go on. Dig.

1197
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,002
You heard me. Dig.

1198
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,632
My God.

1199
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:18,302
Oh, my God.

1200
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:33,234
Call it in.

1201
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:37,071
Get the coroner and every officer
in a 20-mile radius here inside the hour.

1202
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:40,491
Then put out an APB
on Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1203
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:44,162
The information's in my car. Go on.

1204
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:51,419
You can stop, son.

1205
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,259
You can stop now. It's over.

1206
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,594
Hey.

1207
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:03,848
We'll take it, we can take it from here.
We can take it from...

1208
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:12,690
We can take it from here, okay? It's over.

1209
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,031
It's okay.

1210
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,368
It's okay. It's okay.

1211
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,287
It's all over.

1212
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:27,789
Okay?

1213
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,083
File.

1214
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,049
Privacy, please.

1215
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,391
I see that you've been refusing medication,
requiring force feeding.

1216
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,477
All right, Michael. Lunchtime?

1217
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,647
Six days, Mrs. Collins, and no progress.

1218
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,984
We may have to move on
to more strenuous therapies.

1219
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,739
Unless you're willing to prove
that you're doing better

1220
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,909
by signing this.

1221
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,790
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

1222
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,754
Room 18.

1223
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:28,182
I want to talk to somebody
in charge, right now!

1224
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:29,517
Please.

1225
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,644
Who is in charge here?

1226
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:34,981
Open.

1227
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:36,858
I'm the head doctor on duty.

1228
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,193
You're the doctor
who locked up Christine Collins?

1229
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,403
I'm sorry, sir.

1230
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,988
We don't discuss cases
with anyone other than family.

1231
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:44,574
Oh, you'll damn well
discuss this one. Read it.

1232
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,200
- Sir.
- Read it.

1233
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,208
Stop.

1234
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:03,843
Mrs. Collins, one last time.

1235
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:07,430
Are you or are you not
prepared to sign that letter?

1236
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:08,806
No.

1237
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,520
You're free to leave.

1238
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,317
What?

1239
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:23,154
Your clothes are in the next room.
You can change there.

1240
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,407
- In the next room?
- Yes. That's right.

1241
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,701
See to it.

1242
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,082
Christ.

1243
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,293
- Long as it's not the original.
- No, it's not.

1244
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,045
Here it is.

1245
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,963
And who is that?
Is that Baker's file or Larson?

1246
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:44,175
- That's Baker.
- He said he wanted...

1247
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,718
Nurse, I wanna see

1248
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:48,888
every piece of paper you have
on the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

1249
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,932
and I want to see it right now,
do you understand me?

1250
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,684
Every piece. When will she be coming out?

1251
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,728
Oh, it's just up ahead.

1252
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,063
Oh, all right. Let's...

1253
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,231
Hurricane hits West Palm Beach!

1254
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,776
Babe Ruth hits 53rd home run!

1255
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,904
- Kids found murdered in Riverside!
- There it is.

1256
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,823
Biggest crime in Los Angeles history!

1257
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,076
Collins boy assumed dead!

1258
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,704
Read it here! Read it here!

1259
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,087
Mrs. Collins, I'm so sorry.

1260
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,760
Captain, your handling
of the Christine Collins case

1261
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,930
has exposed this department
to public ridicule.

1262
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:35,685
There is even
the possibility of civil and criminal liability.

1263
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:38,646
Sir, nobody could've known
what was happening up at that ranch.

1264
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,774
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

1265
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,943
And as for the Collins woman,

1266
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,862
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

1267
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:49,115
- No?
- No.

1268
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,785
There were four other photos
of missing boys that looked a lot like him.

1269
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,662
The Clark kid could've been mistaken.

1270
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:56,080
Maybe he was.

1271
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,333
Which begs the obvious question.
Who cares?

1272
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:01,961
Sir?

1273
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:06,465
The mayor wants this to go away.
I want this to go away.

1274
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:09,802
The way you do that
is to stop insisting that Walter Collins

1275
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,638
is not among those boys
killed up at that goddamn ranch.

1276
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,266
Because if the boy
you brought back is not Walter Collins,

1277
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,310
and he's not dead up at that ranch,
then where the hell is he?

1278
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:20,104
People are gonna want to know
why we haven't found him.

1279
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,481
Why we're not doing our job.

1280
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,234
But if, on the other hand,

1281
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:29,613
he is, or could be, among those poor boys
killed up in Wineville,

1282
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,366
then the inquiries stop.

1283
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:37,830
It's a momentary embarrassment
you're just gonna have to live with.

1284
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,415
Better a short inconvenience

1285
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:42,668
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1286
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,878
Yes, sir.

1287
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,838
The boy's been gone nearly a year.

1288
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:49,008
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

1289
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,803
Whether he was up at that ranch or not,
the truth is he probably is dead somewhere.

1290
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:56,891
Better his mother accept
that now than later, don't you think?

1291
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,976
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1292
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,686
That'll be all, Captain.

1293
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:06,025
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

1294
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,902
Tell county jail
we're remanding him for trial.

1295
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:12,156
Wait. I didn't do anything.
I wasn't even here when it happened.

1296
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,366
By pretending to be Walter Collins,

1297
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,953
you're interfering in a police investigation
of a kidnapping and murder.

1298
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,040
We can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact.

1299
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,500
That's too bad.

1300
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:26,337
County jail is a lot worse
than a juvenile hall or a foster home.

1301
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,089
It's a lot worse.

1302
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,343
You can't do that. I'm just a kid.

1303
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:39,391
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.
Fifteen. He's going to jail.

1304
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:43,938
All murderers and their accomplices
go to jail. Everybody knows that.

1305
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,567
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

1306
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:51,195
Wait. I don't want to go to jail.

1307
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,748
Prove it.

1308
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,709
I...

1309
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:09,922
I knew Los Angeles
is where they make the Tom Mix movies.

1310
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:14,718
I figured if I could meet Tom Mix
maybe he would let me ride on his horse.

1311
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,140
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

1312
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,563
- How are you feeling?
- All right.

1313
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,357
The police still have a car outside.

1314
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:32,278
I guess they're waiting
to see what your next move is going to be.

1315
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,906
- I'm going home.
- And then?

1316
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:37,867
Then, I've been giving it a lot of thought.

1317
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:42,454
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

1318
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,707
I used to always tell him,

1319
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,876
"You never start a fight,
but you always finish it."

1320
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,963
And I didn't start this fight,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1321
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:55,259
Mrs. Collins, right now
you're a sufficiently high profile that I think

1322
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:59,597
even the police would
hesitate to go after you out in the open,

1323
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,974
but I have to warn you
that could change very quickly

1324
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,768
if they feel their position threatened.

1325
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,645
Very quickly indeed.

1326
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:10,524
What are they gonna do to me now?

1327
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,986
They got nothing.

1328
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,532
I'm going home.

1329
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:43,557
Hi, sis.

1330
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,643
Gordon.

1331
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:48,812
I didn't know you were back in town.

1332
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:53,400
Yeah, I got in a couple of days ago,
figured I'd surprise you.

1333
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,321
- Is that okay?
- Yes. Yes, of course. Of course, come on in.

1334
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,326
Where's that little niece of mine?

1335
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:06,080
She went into town.
Should be back this evening.

1336
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,332
- Bob's here.
- Oh, good.

1337
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,918
I was gonna ask
if I could stay on a couple days.

1338
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,921
- Staying?
- Yeah.

1339
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,173
Listen, can I use your bathroom?

1340
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,259
It's been a long ride
and I could really use a shower.

1341
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,261
- Of course.
- Okay.

1342
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,304
Thank you.

1343
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,112
Is that...

1344
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,740
All right, go next door.
I'll call the police. Hurry.

1345
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:48,080
Operator. How may I connect you?

1346
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,707
He's upstairs, sir.

1347
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,584
Go around the other side! Cut him off!

1348
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,711
- Come with me!
- Yes, sir.

1349
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,087
Let's go!

1350
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:03,095
Mrs. Collins,
I'd like you to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

1351
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,765
Mrs. Collins, my deepest
condolences on your loss.

1352
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,934
May we come in?

1353
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:17,318
I appreciate the sentiment,
but they've yet to find...

1354
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,945
To identify the remains as my son.

1355
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:25,117
I'm afraid it never gets any easier.

1356
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,328
I lost a daughter to polio five years ago.

1357
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:29,580
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think,

1358
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,207
"I should mention this to Claudine."

1359
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:34,626
Then I remember she's not here.

1360
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,797
Please, sit.

1361
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:45,679
I've been on the phone all morning

1362
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,974
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

1363
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:52,227
They said that they won't let me testify
at the hearing or call witnesses.

1364
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,313
That it won't be necessary.

1365
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:57,024
I know. My sources say
the police commission

1366
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:01,195
is going to say that Jones and the LAPD
did absolutely nothing wrong,

1367
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:04,365
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

1368
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:09,328
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

1369
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,835
Then I guess I would
have to hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.

1370
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,630
I went to the best attorney in town,

1371
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,466
a man who's sued this city
four times and won.

1372
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,552
Unfortunately, we can't
afford to really hire him.

1373
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:26,845
I see.

1374
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,848
Which is why I'm doing this pro bono.

1375
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:33,185
It would be my honor
to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins.

1376
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:34,812
In my 15 years as a lawyer,

1377
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,857
I have never seen
anyone fight as long or as hard as you have,

1378
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:42,069
in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.

1379
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:44,238
Thank you.

1380
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:46,156
Let me see what's on the shelf.

1381
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,574
I'll look.

1382
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,037
- Yes? May I...
- My name is S.S. Hahn,

1383
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:55,040
and I have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained

1384
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:58,043
in this institution under
the designation code 12

1385
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:01,213
pending a formal inquiry
into the reasons for their detainment.

1386
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:03,590
I'm sorry, the doctor in charge is not here

1387
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:05,217
- until the morning.
- Madam, let me be clearer.

1388
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:08,053
Either you will produce the people
named in that court order,

1389
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:11,682
or you will find yourself behind bars,
and I mean without a key.

1390
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,852
- I can't authorize you...
- Madam, stand aside.

1391
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,947
- Can I see her now?
- Sure. Absolutely.

1392
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,240
How does she look?

1393
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,601
All right, fellas, step back.
Let's give him room.

1394
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:56,727
Here he is.

1395
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,770
Mr. Northcott,
any comment on your arrest?

1396
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:00,230
Mr. Northcott,
how are you feeling?

1397
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,732
I'm feeling fine.

1398
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,359
I've been on a little vacation,
as some of you know.

1399
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:07,112
It was
a really pleasant vacation.

1400
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:10,699
The police have certainly provided me
with a lot of amusement.

1401
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,035
- How long you been in hiding?
- How did you avoid capture?

1402
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,536
Easy, easy. That's far enough.

1403
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:16,914
- Well, I didn't, did I?
- One more shot!

1404
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:19,583
Have you seen
your picture in the paper?

1405
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:22,920
Didn't know anybody
wanted me until just recently.

1406
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,088
Didn't even try.

1407
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:28,217
My luggage still has my initials on it, fellas.

1408
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,427
Did you know why
the police were after you?

1409
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:33,180
No, but I figured it'd be a good idea
if I were to just stay out of it.

1410
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,348
Any remorse, sir?

1411
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:39,269
Do you have anything to say
to the parents of the children you murdered?

1412
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:42,189
- No comment.
- One more shot, this way!

1413
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:46,193
Mayor Cryer. This is unexpected.

1414
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,862
So was this.

1415
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:52,366
Subpoenas, requests for depositions,
interrogatories.

1416
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,036
All courtesy of Mr. Hahn
and his new client, Christine Collins.

1417
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:58,539
You don't have
to look them over too closely, Chief.

1418
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,333
Your own copies
should be coming any time now.

1419
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:05,003
The city council has also agreed
to look into this, starting immediately.

1420
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:08,632
- God damn it!
- I thought this was supposed to go away.

1421
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:12,386
This is an election year.
I can't afford this kind of press.

1422
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,556
It is going away, sir.
I've instructed Captain Jones to deal with it.

1423
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,182
I'm afraid, falling on his sword

1424
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:21,311
and saying he made a mistake
isn't going to be good enough, Chief.

1425
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:24,982
If we take him out of the picture for a while,

1426
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:29,027
just might help calm things down until
the hearing's finished.

1427
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,672
- What is happening?
- Didn't you hear?

1428
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,507
It's the biggest protest I've ever seen.

1429
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:51,800
- Protest?
- Yeah.

1430
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:55,178
Over the Collins broad,
if you can believe that.

1431
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,858
We want justice! We want justice!

1432
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:11,862
Oh, my!

1433
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,245
Mr. Harris.

1434
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,707
The Lord works
in mysterious ways, Mrs. Collins.

1435
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,752
Boy, does he ever.

1436
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,688
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

1437
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:48,482
There are more people
gathered in this chamber

1438
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,276
than have ever been in this room before.

1439
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:54,863
Therefore, I ask you
to refrain from demonstrations of any kind.

1440
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:55,989
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

1441
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,619
We are all here because we want to know
the real facts in this case.

1442
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,790
And everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.

1443
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,794
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any members
of the police commission.

1444
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,424
Are there any members
of the police department in the room?

1445
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,426
Is Chief Davis here?

1446
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:19,596
Is Captain Jones here?

1447
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:22,557
Is there anybody here
representing the police?

1448
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:26,812
Mrs. Collins, could you come across
the street with me for just a moment?

1449
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,939
There's something I think you should see.

1450
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:31,191
Well, I hate to call a recess
before we've even started,

1451
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,110
but I think a few phone calls are in order.

1452
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,950
The police decided
it'd be best to keep this off the main docket

1453
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:44,496
in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos
we have across the street.

1454
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,886
Mrs. Collins. I'm Leanne Clay.

1455
01:41:00,722 --> 01:41:02,973
- This is my husband, John.
- Hi.

1456
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:07,102
I just wanted to pass along my sympathies.

1457
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:09,312
What we went through
waiting to hear anything

1458
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:13,525
about our son David
was bad enough, now this.

1459
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:18,447
But what the police did to you,
there was no call for that.

1460
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:20,198
No call at all.

1461
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,661
All rise.

1462
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,338
- Please, be seated.
- Bailiff.

1463
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:49,853
Hey.

1464
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,149
I saw you in the papers.

1465
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:58,153
You got a lot of moxie,
standing up to the police like that.

1466
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,702
The defendant will please rise.

1467
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,001
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1468
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:17,214
you've been charged with three counts
of murder in the first degree,

1469
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,010
with an additional 17 counts under review
by the district attorney's office.

1470
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:23,720
How do you plea?

1471
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,265
Not guilty, Your Honor.

1472
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,188
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.

1473
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:42,697
In light of the defendant's penchant
for international travel, no bail will be set.

1474
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:45,325
This court will hear
preliminary motions by tomorrow morning.

1475
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:50,747
The boy, Walter Collins,
was reported as missing, March 10, 1928.

1476
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,167
We then instituted a nationwide search.

1477
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:58,171
On August 18th,
we received a cable indicating that a boy

1478
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:01,675
matching his description
was found in DeKalb, Illinois.

1479
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:05,804
Upon questioning,
he admitted to being Walter Collins.

1480
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:11,017
We then made arrangements
for him to be transported back to California.

1481
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,520
Where Mrs. Collins told you
the boy was not her son.

1482
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,355
Yes. She denied his identity

1483
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:18,441
in spite of
all of the evidence pointing to the contrary.

1484
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:21,611
But, as subsequent
events have demonstrated,

1485
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,405
she was correct.

1486
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:28,118
So, what prompted you to send her
for psychological evaluation?

1487
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,995
Whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy

1488
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:32,581
was not relevant to my decision.

1489
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:34,791
Throughout this period, she acted strangely.

1490
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:38,378
She was often cool
and aloof and unemotional,

1491
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:42,132
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in DeKalb

1492
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,259
and in our subsequent conversation.

1493
01:43:44,343 --> 01:43:48,722
It was because of her disturbing behavior

1494
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:51,725
that I submitted her for observation

1495
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:54,603
to the psychopathic ward
of Los Angeles County General Hospital.

1496
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:55,896
Just like that.

1497
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,230
You snap your fingers

1498
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:59,983
and an innocent woman
is thrown into the psycho ward!

1499
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:03,403
- She wasn't thrown.
- Every family in this state is in grave danger

1500
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,573
when a police captain can take
a woman into his office

1501
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,074
and five minutes later

1502
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,827
have her thrown into the psychopathic ward
on his own authority!

1503
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:12,162
She wasn't thrown.

1504
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,624
She wasn't thrown! She wasn't thrown!

1505
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:18,793
What was that, Captain?

1506
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,254
She wasn't thrown. She was escorted.

1507
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,261
Escorted, thrown,
the verb doesn't matter, Captain.

1508
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:32,599
What does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant.

1509
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:36,269
I am holding a carbon copy
of the affidavit of insanity

1510
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:41,316
that was issued in the case of the
State of California v. Christine Collins.

1511
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,110
- Who signed the affidavit?
- I did.

1512
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,780
Well, now, let me see if I have this correct,

1513
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:50,450
a woman was thrown into
the psychopathic ward without a warrant,

1514
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,702
because no warrant existed.

1515
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:55,288
And when it was finally
written several days later,

1516
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:57,707
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge

1517
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:00,543
because she was already in the asylum!

1518
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:04,631
- Is this correct, Captain?
- Technically, yes.

1519
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:07,801
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing...

1520
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,678
We were dealing with
an extraordinary situation.

1521
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:12,472
Now, is it our fault
that we were being deceived

1522
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:15,350
by a boy who claimed
to be Walter Collins? No.

1523
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,062
In light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior,

1524
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:21,731
who wouldn't begin to think that
there was something the matter with her?

1525
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:25,151
- Because she questioned you?
- No, because she wouldn't listen!

1526
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,987
Because she insisted on being obstinate!

1527
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:30,323
Because she tried to take
matters into her own hand,

1528
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:32,158
best left to qualified officers!

1529
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:33,326
Because once civil disobedience starts...

1530
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,996
Because she was fighting
for the life of her son!

1531
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,081
A boy who may have still been alive

1532
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:42,877
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong!

1533
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,173
And in the end

1534
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:51,386
that's what happened, isn't it?

1535
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:54,931
At some point, while all this was going on,

1536
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,769
Walter Collins was brutally murdered,

1537
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,398
along with as many as 19 other boys

1538
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,610
at the Northcott Ranch in Wineville.

1539
01:46:09,447 --> 01:46:11,614
Is that correct, Captain?

1540
01:46:13,284 --> 01:46:14,784
Yes, it is.

1541
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:17,120
It's a travesty.

1542
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:24,627
No further questions.

1543
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:43,980
Train number 14,
now boarding on track...

1544
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:47,942
So, after much effort,
we were able to identify this boy,

1545
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,570
who's been responsible
for so much trouble lately,

1546
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:54,240
as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1547
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:55,408
Between this,

1548
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:59,412
and the arrest of the man suspected
of murdering the real Walter Collins,

1549
01:46:59,497 --> 01:47:02,749
we've cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.

1550
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:07,170
I hope you gentlemen of the press will give
as much space to the good things we do

1551
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:09,798
as the mistakes that are made
on rare occasions.

1552
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,674
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you

1553
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:14,844
to the boy's real mother,
Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

1554
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:17,764
Arthur.

1555
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,307
I hope he wasn't too much trouble for you.

1556
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,184
Oh, no, not at all.

1557
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,436
How about a photograph, fellas?

1558
01:47:26,524 --> 01:47:27,941
One more.

1559
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:29,943
Mrs. Hutchins,

1560
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:33,363
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was staying
with, wanted him to have these.

1561
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:34,948
They're the clothes she let him wear.

1562
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:36,783
Well, thank you.

1563
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,618
Isn't that nice, Arthur?

1564
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,995
Tell the nice officer, "Thank you."

1565
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:44,124
I don't want them.
Give them to somebody else.

1566
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,792
Precocious little fellow,
isn't he?

1567
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:48,169
It's not my fault. It's the police.

1568
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,881
They said I was Walter Collins, not me!
It wasn't my idea!

1569
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:53,466
- Not my idea!
- Get...

1570
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:55,969
Yeah. Go blame the police
for your own mistakes.

1571
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:58,138
We've seen a lot of that lately, haven't we?

1572
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:01,182
Take care now, Arthur! Safe travels.

1573
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,561
All right, fellas, that's it for today.

1574
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:06,521
Sir, sir!
What did the boy mean by that?

1575
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:10,150
It was March 10th,
and I came home from work,

1576
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,153
and my nine-year-old son, Walter, was gone.

1577
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:16,906
Captain Jones was acting on information
he believed to be correct.

1578
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:20,660
Walter Collins had a diastema,
also known as a diastema.

1579
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,245
That child was never in my classroom.

1580
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:23,830
I can certainly attest to that.

1581
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:26,833
We rely on
our good friends in the police department

1582
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:30,378
to point to us
those people who exhibit behavior

1583
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:33,173
which is socially unacceptable.

1584
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:37,927
About four inches shorter
than the last mark of Walter.

1585
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:44,267
Well, some of these pictures show
what Sanford Clark told me,

1586
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:47,937
that he did in fact
help in the murder of these children.

1587
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,689
Thank you, Detective.

1588
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:51,024
Gentlemen of the jury,

1589
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,776
I ask you to take
a good look at these images.

1590
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:56,446
They establish beyond
any reasonable doubt

1591
01:48:56,572 --> 01:49:00,283
the circumstances and the nature
of these heinous crimes.

1592
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:13,463
I'm in here, Reverend.

1593
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:23,640
When Walter was here,
I used to walk by his room

1594
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:25,892
when he was sleeping.

1595
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:29,979
And even though
I couldn't see him or hear him,

1596
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,773
I could feel him.

1597
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:36,778
That's why I don't think Walter's dead.

1598
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,822
I can still feel him.

1599
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:44,410
- Mrs. Collins...
- No.

1600
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:46,663
I know what the police said.

1601
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:49,791
But that place and the remains,

1602
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,170
they couldn't be properly identified.

1603
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:59,509
And maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked Walter's picture.

1604
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:03,763
I understand you don't want to accept this.

1605
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:05,515
What mother would?

1606
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,355
But I think it's time for you to move on

1607
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,816
and start over for yourself.

1608
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,695
Your son would want you to move on.

1609
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:22,949
Maybe.

1610
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,286
Maybe he'd want me
to keep looking for him.

1611
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:28,997
Maybe he's somewhere waiting for me.

1612
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:32,959
I believe he is waiting, ma'am.

1613
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,296
He's waiting in that place where

1614
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:40,383
we'll all go someday
to be reunited with our loved ones.

1615
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:45,513
And on that day,
he'll know from front to back, end to end,

1616
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:49,142
heart to soul, that you did
everything you could, Mrs. Collins.

1617
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:51,978
Everything.

1618
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,483
We should go, ma'am.

1619
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:59,068
One minute.

1620
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:28,348
This meeting will now come to order.

1621
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:32,352
This committee has
now heard all of the testimony,

1622
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:35,438
and, in light of the facts presented,

1623
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:38,358
we recommend that
the suspension of Captain Jones

1624
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:40,193
be made permanent.

1625
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:47,784
Order! Please. Please.

1626
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:53,456
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

1627
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:55,458
We have, Your Honor.

1628
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:59,045
Will the defendant please rise?

1629
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:05,301
Second, that steps be taken
to investigate a change

1630
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:09,555
in the prevailing laws and procedures
by which a citizen of this city

1631
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:14,102
can be subjected to incarceration
in the county's mental facilities.

1632
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:23,403
You may read the verdict.

1633
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:26,823
"We the jury find
the defendant, Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1634
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:29,492
"guilty on all counts
of murder in the first degree."

1635
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:38,584
Finally, restoration of public confidence
in the police department

1636
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:40,753
can only be achieved

1637
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:46,259
by the removal of its chief of police,
and this committee so recommends.

1638
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:47,593
This hearing is concluded.

1639
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:12,869
Does the defendant wish to make
a statement before judgment is passed?

1640
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:19,375
I want to make it real clear
that I never once got a fair shake from you,

1641
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:21,878
Your Honor,

1642
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,381
or from this court.

1643
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:33,055
The only one in here
worth a good goddamn is her.

1644
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:38,227
'Cause she's the only one
who never badmouthed me to the press.

1645
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:41,397
She's the only one who understands
what it is to be framed by the police

1646
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,900
- for something you didn't do.
- All right, that's enough.

1647
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:49,572
And then to just be thrown in the hole,
to just rot and to fester and to be forgotten

1648
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:51,407
- and fade away, isn't that right?
- Gordon!

1649
01:53:51,492 --> 01:53:52,575
- Counsel!
- Isn't it?

1650
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:55,077
I never killed your boy, Mrs. Collins.

1651
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:56,662
- Counsel, that's enough!
- I would never do that.

1652
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,915
- I would never hurt Walter.
- Counsel, get control of your client

1653
01:53:58,999 --> 01:54:00,249
or I'll have him bound and gagged!

1654
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,834
He's an angel.

1655
01:54:01,919 --> 01:54:04,587
- Come on, Gordon.
- Get off of me!

1656
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:06,255
Now get down.

1657
01:54:08,926 --> 01:54:11,052
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1658
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:14,931
it is the judgment of this court

1659
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,099
that you be conveyed
to San Quentin Prison,

1660
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:20,686
where you'll be held in solitary confinement
for a period of two years,

1661
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:24,440
until October 2, 1930.

1662
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:29,779
On that date, you will
be hanged by the neck until dead.

1663
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:34,784
May God have mercy on your soul.

1664
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:51,694
- Is it all right if I have a 10-minute break?
- Of course.

1665
01:55:54,156 --> 01:55:55,531
You know,

1666
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,618
one of these days
you might actually consider taking

1667
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:00,161
one of these 10-minute breaks.

1668
01:56:00,245 --> 01:56:01,912
It might be good for you.

1669
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:03,372
We'll see.

1670
01:56:06,335 --> 01:56:08,336
This is Christine Collins.

1671
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,296
I called yesterday.

1672
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,965
I was wondering if
you had a chance to look through the files

1673
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:16,719
and see if there was
a match to my son, Walter Collins.

1674
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,221
I see.

1675
01:56:19,348 --> 01:56:22,183
Well, if it's all right with you,
I'll call back in a month.

1676
01:56:22,267 --> 01:56:23,434
Thank you very much.

1677
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,770
- Mrs. Collins.
- I was just...

1678
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,271
Yes, I know.

1679
01:56:28,398 --> 01:56:31,275
In fact, that's why I wanted to see you.

1680
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,194
It's about Walter. We had a...

1681
01:56:34,112 --> 01:56:37,073
Well, we received a very strange telegram.

1682
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,158
From who?

1683
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:42,411
Gordon Northcott. He's asked to see you.

1684
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:44,705
Why?

1685
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:47,750
He said he knows
you're still looking for your son,

1686
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,752
and before he dies...

1687
01:56:53,215 --> 01:56:56,550
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

1688
01:56:56,635 --> 01:57:00,262
Christine, he's willing
to finally admit that he did it.

1689
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:03,557
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

1690
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:08,771
then he'll tell you the truth, to your face
so that you can get on with your life

1691
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,315
and have some peace.

1692
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:15,986
As you know, he's set to be executed
the day after tomorrow at San Quentin,

1693
01:57:16,113 --> 01:57:19,115
so you don't have a lot of time.

1694
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:23,994
It took me most of
the morning to make all the arrangements.

1695
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,122
Turns out,
you're the first woman in 30 years

1696
01:57:26,248 --> 01:57:29,083
the state has allowed to visit a serial killer

1697
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:31,460
on the eve of his execution.

1698
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:53,149
You'll be all right, ma'am?

1699
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:55,693
- Yes.
- We're right at the door.

1700
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:00,197
Twenty minutes.

1701
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:08,122
Don't suppose you got a cigarette?

1702
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,335
Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.

1703
01:58:13,462 --> 01:58:17,673
You said that if I did,
you would tell me the truth about my son.

1704
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:20,801
Yeah.

1705
01:58:22,304 --> 01:58:24,847
You're right. I did say that.

1706
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:28,517
But see, the thing is,

1707
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:32,021
I didn't really think that you would come.

1708
01:58:32,147 --> 01:58:33,481
And now.

1709
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:36,692
And now... And now what?

1710
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:39,153
I just didn't expect that you'd...

1711
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:43,449
I don't wanna see you.

1712
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:48,287
- You don't wanna see me?
- No. See, I can't do this.

1713
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:50,372
I don't wanna talk to you.
I can't talk to you right now,

1714
01:58:50,457 --> 01:58:52,458
not with what they're
gonna be doing to me tomorrow.

1715
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:57,379
It's one thing, Mrs. Collins,
to send a telegram, that is really easy.

1716
01:58:57,506 --> 01:59:01,967
But when it's here, right now,
in person, you know,

1717
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:03,469
I just, I can't...

1718
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:05,554
I can't tell you
what you want to hear, Mrs. Collins.

1719
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:06,639
And why not?

1720
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:10,309
Because I don't want
to go to hell with a lie on my lips.

1721
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,478
See, I did my penance,

1722
01:59:12,562 --> 01:59:15,898
and I asked God to forgive me and he did,
so far as I know.

1723
01:59:16,024 --> 01:59:18,484
And I have been really good ever since.

1724
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:23,405
But if I lie now,
if I commit any sins right now,

1725
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:26,909
I'm out of time here,
and I won't be forgiven again.

1726
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:29,328
And I'll tell you one thing,
I am not going to hell.

1727
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,249
I'm not...

1728
01:59:40,549 --> 01:59:43,259
Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.

1729
01:59:53,603 --> 01:59:55,020
Mr. Northcott, please look at me.

1730
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:59,358
Mr. Northcott, please look at me.

1731
02:00:06,074 --> 02:00:07,867
Did you kill my son?

1732
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:14,456
Did you kill my son?

1733
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:16,792
I don't know what you're talking about.

1734
02:00:16,877 --> 02:00:18,294
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

1735
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:19,461
Did you kill my son?

1736
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:24,592
I told you,
I don't wanna talk to you right now.

1737
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:27,553
Did you kill my son?

1738
02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:29,138
Did you kill my son?

1739
02:00:29,306 --> 02:00:30,306
Did you kill my son?

1740
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:31,724
- Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1741
02:00:31,808 --> 02:00:33,058
You don't know? You don't remember?

1742
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:34,476
- Did you kill my son?
- Oh, no.

1743
02:00:34,603 --> 02:00:37,313
Answer me!
You answer me! You answer me!

1744
02:00:37,397 --> 02:00:39,398
- I don't know their names.
- Did you kill my son? Yes...

1745
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:41,984
- You better get off of me.
- Or what?

1746
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:43,569
- Did you kill my son?
- I don't know.

1747
02:00:43,653 --> 02:00:44,904
Did you kill...

1748
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:46,238
Did you kill my son?

1749
02:00:46,323 --> 02:00:47,573
- You know his name!
- Oh, I don't. No.

1750
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:49,408
You know his name!
You called him an angel!

1751
02:00:49,492 --> 02:00:51,410
- No.
- You know his name!

1752
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:52,828
- No, I don't know his name.
- Did you kill my son?

1753
02:00:52,913 --> 02:00:54,914
They cried for their
parents to come and get them and then I...

1754
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,249
Did you kill my son? Did you kill my son?

1755
02:00:57,334 --> 02:00:58,417
- Answer me!
- Or what?

1756
02:00:58,501 --> 02:00:59,585
Answer me!

1757
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:01,670
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hurt me?

1758
02:01:01,838 --> 02:01:03,672
I hope you go to hell.

1759
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,758
I hope you go to hell.

1760
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:07,593
- Did you kill my son?
- Guard! Hey, guard!

1761
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:09,595
Did you kill my son?

1762
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,472
- Did you kill my son?
- Ma'am, please.

1763
02:01:11,556 --> 02:01:13,641
- Come on.
- I hope you go to hell!

1764
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:17,937
I hope you go to hell! I hope you go to hell!

1765
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,522
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1766
02:01:22,651 --> 02:01:25,069
Did you kill my son?

1767
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:27,047
"Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1768
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:30,050
"you have been convicted of murder,

1769
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:32,886
"the penalty for which is death by hanging.

1770
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:36,974
"There have been no stays or reprieves,

1771
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,059
"therefore the execution will go forward

1772
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:42,896
"as stipulated under
the laws of the State of California."

1773
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:47,234
Do you have any last words?

1774
02:02:47,318 --> 02:02:48,569
No.

1775
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:52,906
Nothing.

1776
02:02:57,037 --> 02:03:02,041
I kept clean after I confessed, Reverend,
just like I said I would.

1777
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,172
Will it...

1778
02:03:08,256 --> 02:03:09,757
Will it hurt?

1779
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:19,433
Please, please, not so fast.

1780
02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:23,812
Please, don't make me walk so fast!

1781
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:27,983
Please, don't make me!

1782
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:30,319
No, I don't wanna.

1783
02:03:41,289 --> 02:03:44,124
No! Thirteen steps.

1784
02:03:45,794 --> 02:03:47,836
Thirteen steps.

1785
02:03:47,962 --> 02:03:50,798
But I didn't touch them all, you bastards.

1786
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:54,426
I didn't touch them all.
I didn't touch them all.

1787
02:03:55,428 --> 02:03:57,137
Please!

1788
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:05,813
A prayer! Please!

1789
02:04:06,773 --> 02:04:08,482
God!

1790
02:04:09,526 --> 02:04:13,612
Please! Somebody here, please,

1791
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:16,824
say a prayer for me!

1792
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:20,119
No, God. No!

1793
02:04:22,497 --> 02:04:24,540
No! No!

1794
02:04:35,343 --> 02:04:39,513
Silent night

1795
02:04:42,684 --> 02:04:46,728
Holy night

1796
02:04:48,273 --> 02:04:51,817
All is calm

1797
02:04:53,069 --> 02:04:57,030
All is bright

1798
02:04:58,032 --> 02:05:02,619
Round yon Virgin

1799
02:05:03,288 --> 02:05:06,206
Mother and child

1800
02:05:58,051 --> 02:06:01,637
We're having a party tonight
at my place for the Academy show.

1801
02:06:01,763 --> 02:06:03,639
- You want to come?
- No, I have a million things to do.

1802
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:04,806
Oh, come on, please. Please!

1803
02:06:06,017 --> 02:06:07,976
You girls blew the
phone lines out from here to Baltimore.

1804
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:09,311
Someone's gotta fix them.

1805
02:06:09,395 --> 02:06:10,979
Go, have a good night. I have the radio.

1806
02:06:11,105 --> 02:06:12,648
Okay.

1807
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:15,776
- You sure?
- I'm sure. I'm sure. Have a good night.

1808
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:17,861
- Good night.
- Good night.

1809
02:06:22,242 --> 02:06:24,243
Listen, I really...

1810
02:06:26,162 --> 02:06:27,537
Hello, Ben.

1811
02:06:29,624 --> 02:06:33,502
I'm meeting some friends
at Musso and Frank's for dinner.

1812
02:06:34,128 --> 02:06:37,839
They're gonna pipe in
the movie ceremonies into the restaurant.

1813
02:06:37,966 --> 02:06:40,050
Should be quite a night.

1814
02:06:40,134 --> 02:06:42,261
I'd love it if you'd come.

1815
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:46,598
I just have so much work I should be doing.

1816
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:49,810
Good night.

1817
02:06:52,563 --> 02:06:53,689
Ben?

1818
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:56,858
I...

1819
02:06:56,985 --> 02:07:00,362
I put $2 down on it Happened One Night
to win Best Picture.

1820
02:07:00,488 --> 02:07:04,032
Seems I am the only person that thinks
it has a chance against Cleopatra.

1821
02:07:04,117 --> 02:07:06,159
But, if it wins, do you wanna celebrate
tomorrow night at dinner?

1822
02:07:07,704 --> 02:07:10,330
It's a deal, Christine. See you.

1823
02:07:10,415 --> 02:07:12,916
If your movie wins, I'll call you.

1824
02:07:13,001 --> 02:07:14,459
I'll be here.

1825
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:19,798
- Hi.
- Hi.

1826
02:07:21,884 --> 02:07:25,137
...The Thin Man, Cleopatra...

1827
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:26,847
Overrated.

1828
02:07:26,931 --> 02:07:28,974
...and It Happened One Night.

1829
02:07:29,058 --> 02:07:30,976
Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert.

1830
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,436
I rest my case.

1831
02:07:32,562 --> 02:07:34,938
May I have the envelope, please?

1832
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:40,319
And the winneris It Happened One Night.

1833
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:44,406
I knew it! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

1834
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:48,076
Dinner is on me.

1835
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:49,953
Is this Christine Collins?

1836
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:52,164
Yes, it is.

1837
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:54,958
This is Mrs. Clay. Do you remember me?

1838
02:07:55,585 --> 02:07:57,878
Mrs. Clay,
of course I remember you.

1839
02:07:57,962 --> 02:07:59,963
I just had to call you right off.

1840
02:08:00,089 --> 02:08:02,174
- What is it?
- The police just called.

1841
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:04,593
They found a boy, Christine.

1842
02:08:06,304 --> 02:08:08,388
- Where?
- Lincoln Heights Precinct.

1843
02:08:08,473 --> 02:08:11,641
- We're leaving right now.
- I'll be right down.

1844
02:08:34,332 --> 02:08:35,624
Oh, here.

1845
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:37,626
I wanted to go to him right off,

1846
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:40,879
but they said it was
important to talk to him alone first.

1847
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:43,048
- Are they sure?
- They're sure.

1848
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:46,051
But, more important, I'm sure.

1849
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:47,177
It's my boy, all right.

1850
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:49,471
It's David.

1851
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:51,598
He's alive, Christine.

1852
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:53,141
They found him up in Hesperia.

1853
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:55,894
You were
walking home from school,

1854
02:08:55,978 --> 02:08:58,230
and they told you
they needed help finding a dog.

1855
02:08:58,314 --> 02:08:59,648
Yeah.

1856
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:02,776
So, after you got in the truck,
what happened next?

1857
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,153
They drove me around for a long time,

1858
02:09:05,321 --> 02:09:06,863
then we ended up at this ranch.

1859
02:09:06,989 --> 02:09:09,241
Come on. Come on, Davy.

1860
02:09:10,493 --> 02:09:11,743
- Davy! Come on.
- Get off me.

1861
02:09:11,828 --> 02:09:13,078
Don't fight this much. Hey!

1862
02:09:13,162 --> 02:09:15,330
Were there other boys there?

1863
02:09:15,998 --> 02:09:18,417
Yeah. Five, I think.

1864
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:21,920
It was a long time ago, though.

1865
02:09:22,004 --> 02:09:24,214
Hello, boys. This is Davy.

1866
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:25,674
I know you'll make him feel... Hey!

1867
02:09:26,884 --> 02:09:30,178
No. No! Hey! Shut up!

1868
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:32,097
Did you speak to them?

1869
02:09:33,015 --> 02:09:35,684
Yeah? You remember any of their names?

1870
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:38,437
Yeah.

1871
02:09:38,521 --> 02:09:39,938
Two of them were brothers.

1872
02:09:40,022 --> 02:09:42,858
I think their last name was Winslow.

1873
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:46,361
The oldest one was Jeffrey.

1874
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,575
And Walter.

1875
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:55,620
Walter?

1876
02:09:56,289 --> 02:09:59,291
- Yeah.
- Do you remember Walter's last name?

1877
02:10:04,755 --> 02:10:05,881
Collins.

1878
02:10:07,717 --> 02:10:09,259
Walter Collins.

1879
02:10:10,303 --> 02:10:13,555
Tell me something, if you only remember
some of the boys' names,

1880
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:16,266
how come you remember his full name?

1881
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:19,102
Because of what happened.

1882
02:10:19,228 --> 02:10:21,188
Walter and Jeffrey were talking.

1883
02:10:21,272 --> 02:10:23,231
- Pull it.
- They kept checking around

1884
02:10:23,316 --> 02:10:25,942
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

1885
02:10:26,068 --> 02:10:27,611
Be careful!

1886
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:29,321
Hurry!

1887
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:31,781
Maybe make enough
room to get out of there and run.

1888
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:35,368
When we get out, we split up,
go in different directions. Okay?

1889
02:10:35,453 --> 02:10:37,454
They can't catch all of us.

1890
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:39,623
It'd make an awful lot of noise.

1891
02:10:39,749 --> 02:10:42,375
Be quiet. You got it?

1892
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:45,754
And if it wasn't wide enough,
then we'd be stuck.

1893
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:51,927
Wait. Help! Help!
Come on, hurry!

1894
02:10:52,803 --> 02:10:56,139
My foot's stuck!
Hurry, help! Help me, please!

1895
02:10:58,726 --> 02:11:01,603
He's coming! He's...

1896
02:11:01,729 --> 02:11:03,396
My foot!

1897
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:04,981
He's coming.

1898
02:11:06,234 --> 02:11:07,734
Hurry, run, run, run!

1899
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:15,283
Hey! What the hell are you boys...

1900
02:11:17,787 --> 02:11:22,415
Mary, Mother of God! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1901
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:25,502
You get back here! Hey! Hold it! Hey!

1902
02:11:27,964 --> 02:11:28,964
Hey!

1903
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,384
- Hey!
- Ah!

1904
02:11:33,636 --> 02:11:34,761
Stop!

1905
02:11:36,514 --> 02:11:37,847
Check on the others!

1906
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:39,349
Stop! Damn it!

1907
02:11:39,475 --> 02:11:41,685
Boys, I'm coming after you!

1908
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:44,854
Damn it! Damn it!

1909
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:48,066
Boys, I'll find you no matter where you are!

1910
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:50,527
- They're not in there!
- Come on! Get in the car!

1911
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:54,739
I'm gonna find you!
Damn it! Damn it! Come on.

1912
02:11:54,824 --> 02:11:57,200
Shit! Get in the car, Sanford!

1913
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:07,794
That was the last I saw of any of them.

1914
02:12:07,878 --> 02:12:10,880
So, you don't know
if either of the other two were captured?

1915
02:12:11,007 --> 02:12:12,048
No.

1916
02:12:13,384 --> 02:12:15,260
All I know is,

1917
02:12:15,344 --> 02:12:17,971
if Walter hadn't come back for me

1918
02:12:19,056 --> 02:12:21,808
I don't think
I ever would've gotten out of there.

1919
02:12:22,643 --> 02:12:24,019
Okay.

1920
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,522
So, what happened after that?

1921
02:12:27,648 --> 02:12:29,274
I kept off the main roads,

1922
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:34,321
until I saw a train stopped at a crossing
and I jumped in.

1923
02:12:34,697 --> 02:12:37,782
Why didn't you tell anyone
what had happened?

1924
02:12:37,867 --> 02:12:39,576
I was afraid.

1925
02:12:39,702 --> 02:12:42,829
I thought they'd come after me, or my folks.

1926
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:47,042
So, I just didn't tell anybody.

1927
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:53,006
I was on my own until I got a free meal
from this lady, Miss Lansing.

1928
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:55,717
Told her I was an orphan, on my own.

1929
02:12:57,887 --> 02:12:59,929
She said I could stay on.

1930
02:13:01,098 --> 02:13:02,432
And I did.

1931
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:05,018
Every night,

1932
02:13:05,102 --> 02:13:08,980
I'd wake up thinking
they were right outside my window.

1933
02:13:09,065 --> 02:13:11,524
And then I heard
the police talking on the radio

1934
02:13:11,609 --> 02:13:14,361
about what happened at the ranch.

1935
02:13:14,445 --> 02:13:16,821
And I thought,
"For sure I can't go back now."

1936
02:13:16,906 --> 02:13:19,949
Why? Why not?

1937
02:13:20,076 --> 02:13:22,869
Since I didn't tell anybody what happened.

1938
02:13:24,205 --> 02:13:26,956
I was afraid they'd
blame me for those kids being dead.

1939
02:13:28,876 --> 02:13:30,877
So I just stayed away.

1940
02:13:32,505 --> 02:13:36,174
What made you come forward now,
after all this time?

1941
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:38,259
Why come forward now?

1942
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:43,515
I really miss my mom.

1943
02:13:45,893 --> 02:13:47,769
I really miss my dad.

1944
02:13:50,773 --> 02:13:52,774
I just wanna go home.

1945
02:13:55,903 --> 02:13:57,737
I just wanna go home.

1946
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,745
Are you all right?

1947
02:14:06,414 --> 02:14:08,623
I love you.

1948
02:14:41,115 --> 02:14:42,824
I still can't believe it.

1949
02:14:42,908 --> 02:14:46,786
Five years, case closed,
everyone thinks he's dead, and there he is.

1950
02:14:48,414 --> 02:14:51,124
Wouldn't be, if it wasn't for Walter.

1951
02:14:52,793 --> 02:14:55,336
Your son did a brave thing, Mrs. Collins.

1952
02:14:55,463 --> 02:14:57,589
You should be very proud of him.

1953
02:14:57,673 --> 02:14:59,007
I am.

1954
02:15:01,343 --> 02:15:02,927
You still think he's out there?

1955
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:04,262
Why not?

1956
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:07,432
Three boys made
a run for it that night, Detective.

1957
02:15:07,516 --> 02:15:09,017
And if one got out,

1958
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:12,270
then maybe either
or both of the others did, too.

1959
02:15:12,354 --> 02:15:15,857
Maybe Walter's out there,
having the same fears that he did.

1960
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:20,695
Afraid to come home and identify himself,
or afraid he'll get into trouble.

1961
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:23,823
But either way,

1962
02:15:23,949 --> 02:15:27,035
it gives me something
I didn't have before tonight.

1963
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,536
What's that?

1964
02:15:29,497 --> 02:15:30,705
Hope.
