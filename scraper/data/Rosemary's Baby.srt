1
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,322
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes. Yes.

2
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,115
He's an actor.

3
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,243
Oh, an actor.
We're very popular with actors.

4
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,912
Have I, uh, seen you in anything?

5
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,082
Well, let's see.
I did Hamlet a while back. Didn't I, Liz?

6
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,001
And then we did The Sandpiper, and then...

7
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,338
He's joking. He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross...

8
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,590
and a lot of television plays and commercials.

9
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,717
That's where the money is, isn't it...
commercials?

10
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,719
And the artistic thrills too.

11
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,853
Seven, Diego.

12
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,855
Originally the smallest apartment was a nine.

13
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,440
They've been broken up
into four, fives, and sixes.

14
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,693
7-E is a four.

15
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,028
Originally the back part of a ten.

16
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,030
It has the original dining room
for its living room...

17
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,116
another bedroom for the bedroom...

18
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,201
and two servants' rooms thrown together...

19
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,370
for a dining room or a second bedroom.

20
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,831
- Do you have children?
- Uh...

21
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,542
Uh, we plan to.

22
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,378
We must oil that gate, Diego.

23
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,340
This way, please.

24
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,933
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia, passed away...

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,645
just a few days ago,
so nothing has been moved yet.

26
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,148
Her son asked me to say
that some of the furniture...

27
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,774
can be picked up practically for the asking.

28
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,776
Did she die in the apartment?

29
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,821
- Not that it makes any difference.
- Oh, no, no, no. In a hospital.

30
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,657
She'd been in a coma for weeks.

31
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,534
- After you, please.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,123
She was very old and passed away
without ever waking.

33
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,376
I'd be grateful to go that way myself
when the time comes.

34
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,422
Oh, no, no, no.
Not in the apartment, no.

35
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,759
She was chipper right to the end.

36
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,844
One of the first women lawyers in New York City.

37
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,221
She did a little gardening on the side too.

38
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,265
She was quite a woman.

39
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,644
Oh, closet.
Oh, plenty of closets.

40
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,191
A nice view of the park.
Oh, very nice view.

41
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,486
Now, this room, for instance...
it would make a lovely nursery.

42
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,281
Yes, yellow-and-white wallpaper
would brighten it tremendously.

43
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,325
What are all these things here?

44
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,912
- Herbs, mostly.
- A nice, large bathroom...

45
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,830
Mint, basil...

46
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,583
No marijuana?

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,543
Come on.

48
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,258
The, uh, master bedroom.

49
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,843
Oh, yes.

50
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,679
Here we are, back at the hallway again.

51
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,806
- Oh, yes.
- There.

52
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,935
Oh! Oh, Guy!

53
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,937
Yeah.

54
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,439
- Fireplace works, of course.
- That's right.

55
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,733
Oh!

56
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,736
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment!
I love it!

57
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,656
See what she's trying to do?
She's trying to get you to lower the rent.

58
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,950
Yes, well, we'd raise it if we were allowed.

59
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,494
Apartments with this kind of charm...

60
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,416
Why, that's odd!

61
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,172
There's a closet behind that secretary.

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,925
I'm su... I'm sure there is.

63
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,177
Yeah... Oh, I think you're right.

64
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,308
She moved it.
It used to be there.

65
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,734
Give me a hand, will you?

66
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,300
I see now why she went into a coma!

67
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,764
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89.

68
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,059
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.

69
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,856
I'm authorized to show the apartment.

70
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,357
Well!

71
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,485
Whoever she locked in got out.

72
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,570
Or perhaps she didn't need five closets.

73
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,324
But why would she cover up
her vacuum cleaner and her towels?

74
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,910
Hmm. I don't suppose
we'll ever know.

75
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,288
Maybe she was becoming senile after all.
Is there anything else?

76
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,415
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,626
It's bigger than the other one.

78
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,212
Yeah. It's more expensive too,
you know?

79
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,006
It's better located.

80
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,093
Yeah, well, God knows I could walk
to all the theaters from here.

81
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,303
Oh, Guy, let's take it. Please?

82
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,098
That living room could be...
Oh, please let's take it.

83
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,226
Okay, darlin'.
We get out of the other lease, okay.

84
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,311
I was tempted to write
the management that you were...

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,355
drug addicts and litterbugs.

86
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,691
Instead, I decided to lie and tell them
you were wonderful tenants.

87
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,320
- Ah, you're great, Hutch.
- Wish I could talk you out of it, though.

88
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,490
- He's pulling your leg, Ro, honey.
- Indeed I'm not.

89
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,367
Now, that looks great.
That is...

90
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,328
Are you aware that the Bramford
had rather an unpleasant reputation...

91
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,372
around the turn of the century?

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,916
It's where the Trench sisters conducted...

93
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,127
their little dietary experiments...

94
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,337
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.

95
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,840
Adrian Marcato lived there too.
So did Pearl Ames.

96
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,050
- Who were the Trench sisters?
- Who was Adrian Marcato?

97
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,262
The Trench sisters
were two proper Victorian ladies.

98
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,723
They cooked and ate several
young children, including a niece.

99
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,602
- Oh, lovely.
- Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft.

100
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,063
He made quite a splash
in the '90s by announcing...

101
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,566
that he'd conjured up the living devil.

102
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,360
Apparently people believed him,
so they attacked...

103
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,529
and nearly killed him
in the lobby of the Bramford.

104
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,032
- You're joking.
- Later the Keith Kennedy business began...

105
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,660
and by the '20s, the house was half empty.

106
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,830
I knew about Keith Kennedy.
I didn't know that Marcato lived there.

107
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,041
- And those sisters.
- World War I I filled the house up again.

108
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,420
- Terrific.
- What, the house?

109
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,214
- The lamb.
- They called it "Black Bramford."

110
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,468
But Hutch, awful things happen
in every apartment house.

111
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,138
But this house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.

112
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,184
In '59, a dead infant was found...

113
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,186
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.

114
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,063
Mmm.
You really rouse my appetite.

115
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,608
Have some more wine.

116
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,063
Roman?

117
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,857
Bring me in some root beer when you come.

118
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,561
Hey, these are shelves.

119
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,370
Hey, let's make love.

120
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,081
- - Shh!

121
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,043
I think I hear the Trench sisters chewing.

122
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,795
Oh!

123
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,308
Straight up to the left.

124
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,188
Here at Daytona, Florida,
it's the 250 cc 100-Mile Classic...

125
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,358
with Yamaha leading the pack
on the final lap and winning it...

126
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,361
as Yamaha takes seven of the top ten places.

127
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,407
It's the third straight year for Yamaha...
a clean sweep.

128
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,492
Yamaha is race-bred from champions.

129
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,286
And as you can see,
we have a model for every kind of riding.

130
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,040
You know, you really should
discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.

131
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,167
Why don't you get on, have a ride?
Go on.

132
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

133
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,760
Look.

134
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,352
It's great.

135
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,617
I'm sorry.

136
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,121
I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.

137
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,375
It's all right.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.

139
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,378
- I don't see any resemblance.
- Do you know her?

140
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,297
No.

141
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,259
My name is Terry Gionoffrio.

142
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,219
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

143
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,555
Uh, we're new tenants here.

144
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,932
I'm staying with the Castevets,
the seventh floor.

145
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,059
I'm their guest, sort of, since June.

146
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,604
Our apartment used to be the back part of yours.

147
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,273
Oh, for goodness' sakes.
You took the old lady's apartment, Mrs....

148
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,650
Yeah, um, Miss... Gar-Gardenia.

149
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,445
Gardenia. Yeah.
She was a good friend of the Castevets.

150
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,780
She used to grow herbs
and things for her to cook with.

151
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,742
- I saw those plants.
- Well, now she grows her own things.

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,287
- - Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.

153
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,998
- What does your husband do?
- He's an actor.

154
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,585
- No kidding? What's his name?
- Guy Woodhouse.

155
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,171
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross...

156
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,007
and he does a lot of television and radio.

157
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,052
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I'll bet I've seen him.

158
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,473
- Wow!
- Ooh!

159
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,934
- I hate this basement.
- Yeah, me too.

160
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,644
Gives me the creeps.

161
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,772
Listen, why don't we come down here
together regular and do our laundry?

162
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,690
Okay, that'd be great.

163
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,610
I have a good-luck charm.
It might work for both of us.

164
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,031
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah, isn't it?

165
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,076
- Mm-hmm!
- Mrs. Castevet gave it to me. It's good luck.

166
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,704
Or anyway, it's supposed to be.
It's got some stuff inside.

167
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,087
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.

168
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,298
It's a beautiful charm, though.
I've never seen anything like it.

169
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,050
European.

170
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,970
The Castevets are the most wonderful
people in the world, bar none.

171
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,430
They picked me up off the sidewalk, literally.

172
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,349
You were sick?

173
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,310
I was starving and on dope
and doing a lot of other things.

174
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,230
They're childless, though.
I'm like the daughter they never had.

175
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,983
At first I thought they wanted me
for some kind of a sex thing...

176
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,652
but they've turned out to be
like real grandparents.

177
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,946
It's nice to know there are people like that...

178
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,323
when you hear so much about apathy...

179
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,951
and people who are afraid of getting involved.

180
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,203
I'd be dead now if it wasn't for them.

181
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,414
That's an absolute fact.
Dead or in jail.

182
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,000
You don't have any family
that could've helped you?

183
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,252
A brother in the navy.

184
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,964
Why, it's impossible
to be a hundred percent sure.

185
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,134
If you want my opinion,
we shouldn't tell her at all.

186
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,178
- That's my opinion!
- That must be the partition.

187
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,725
It's the back part of the original ten
with a dining room.

188
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,727
And there's...
there's a closet over here...

189
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,479
and then there's a closet over here.

190
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,392
- What floor?
- Seven.

191
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,394
Stay back, will ya, lady?

192
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,322
Get back, now, will you, please?
Get back. There's nothin' to see.

193
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,076
- Oh, my God!
- Get back, will you, please?

194
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,620
Jesus!

195
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,373
- Get back!
- We know her.

196
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,084
- What's her name?
- Terry.

197
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,086
Terry what?

198
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,379
Ro?

199
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,714
What was her name again?
Terry what?

200
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,218
Uh, I don't remember.
An Italian name.

201
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,970
She was staying with some people
named Castevet. 7-A.

202
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,598
Yeah, we got that already.

203
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,394
Short and sweet. She stuck it
to the windowsill with a Band-Aid.

204
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,648
- Theresa Gionoffrio.
- Move on!

205
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,442
Move on!

206
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,070
- You knew her?
- Only slightly.

207
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,448
- Come on, Ro. Let's go.
- Oh! Here they come.

208
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,787
You folks the Castevets on the seventh floor?

209
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,247
We are.

210
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,375
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?

211
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,836
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?

212
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,213
You'd better brace yourself for some bad news.

213
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,675
She's dead.
Jumped out of the window.

214
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,344
That's not possible.
That's a mistake.

215
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,764
Artie, want to let these folks
take a look, please?

216
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,060
I knew this would happen.

217
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,813
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

218
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,817
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

219
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,653
Well, I... It doesn't mean
she killed herself.

220
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,990
She was a very happy girl
with no reason for self-destruction.

221
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,701
She... must've been cleanin'
the windows or something.

222
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,413
- She wasn't cleaning windows at midnight.
- Why not? Maybe she was.

223
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,498
Is that her handwriting?

224
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,295
- Yeah.
- Definitely. Absolutely.

225
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,715
Thank you. I'll see this gets back to you
when we're done with it.

226
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,092
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

227
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,762
- She was so happy.
- Who's the next of kin?

228
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,098
Ah, she was all alone.
She didn't have anybody. Only us.

229
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,851
- Didn't she have a brother?
- Did she?

230
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,145
She said she did... in the navy.

231
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,356
- It's news to me.
- Do you know
where he's stationed?

232
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,317
No, I don't.

233
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,903
She mentioned him to me in the laundry room.

234
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,698
- I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
- Uh, we're in 7-E.

235
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,284
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castevet.

236
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,329
She seemed so happy and full of...

237
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,333
She said wonderful things about you
and your husband, how grateful she was.

238
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,709
Thank you.

239
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,337
Know anything else about this brother
except he's in the navy?

240
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,381
- No, I don't.
- It should be easy to find him.

241
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,969
- I'm so stunned and so sorry.
- Yeah, it's such a pity.

242
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,013
Well, thank you.

243
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,598
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything!

244
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,233
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said...

245
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,403
because I'm not interested!

246
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,905
If you'd listened to me,
we wouldn't have had to do this!

247
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,159
- We'd have been all set to go now instead
of havin' to start all over from scratch!
- Shh!

248
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,287
I told you not to tell her in advance!

249
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,998
I told you
she wouldn't be open-minded!

250
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,961
I told Sister Veronica about the windows...

251
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,630
and she withdrew the school
from the competition. Otherwise...

252
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,141
Hello. How are you?

253
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,852
- Fine. May I come in a minute?
- Yes, of course. Please do.

254
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,147
I just come over to thank you for saying
those nice things the other night.

255
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,149
- Oh, no, please...
- Poor Terry.

256
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,151
We thought maybe we failed her some way...

257
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,445
though her note made it crystal clear we hadn't.

258
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,531
You'll never know how helpful it was
in such a shock moment.

259
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,660
So I do thank you. Roman does too.
Roman's my hubby.

260
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,829
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.

261
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,082
Yeah. Well, she was
cremated yesterday.

262
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,876
Now we gotta forget and go on.

263
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,004
It won't be easy. We don't have children
of our own. You have any?

264
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,798
- No, we don't.
- No? Well, there you...

265
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,468
Oh! That's a nice...

266
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,304
Look how you put the table!
Isn't that interesting?

267
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,848
- I saw it in a magazine.
- Oh, my.

268
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,476
Nice paint job. Oh.

269
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,355
Oh. Oh, that's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?

270
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,816
Well, only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.

271
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,194
- Oh, you pregnant?
- No, not yet.

272
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,863
- I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
- Wonderful.

273
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,240
Well, you're young and healthy.
You ought to have lots of children.

274
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,034
We plan to have three.

275
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:30,288
Dying to see what you did to this apartment.
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.

276
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,374
- I know. Terry told me.
- Oh, did she?

277
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,044
- You two had some long talks together
in the laundry room, huh?
- Only one.

278
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,171
Oh, my goodness!

279
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,966
Ah, it looks so much brighter.

280
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,301
What do you pay for a chair like that?

281
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,762
Uh... Oh, I'm not sure, really.

282
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,390
I think about $200.

283
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,017
What does your hubby do?

284
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,061
He's an actor.

285
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,730
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.

286
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,526
He's so good-Iookin'.
What movies was he in?

287
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,778
No movies.
He was in two plays...

288
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,155
called Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross...

289
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,241
and a lot of television and radio.

290
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,536
Listen, Rosemary,
I got a two-inch-thick sirloin steak...

291
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,496
sittin' defrostin' this minute.

292
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,083
Why don't you and Guy come over and have
supper with us tonight? What do you say?

293
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,252
- Oh, no, we couldn't.
- Why not?

294
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,673
- No. Really, that's very kind of you, but...
- It would be a real help to us.

295
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,093
First night we'll be alone since...

296
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,762
Are you sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you?

297
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,348
Honey, if it was trouble, I wouldn't ask you.

298
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,977
All right. You go ahead and count on us.
I'll have to check with Guy, though.

299
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,147
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer.

300
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,316
Oh, here's your mail.
Nah, ads.

301
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,277
Thank you.

302
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,787
Yoo-hoo!

303
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,930
Donald Baumgart got that part.

304
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,236
It's a bad play anyway.

305
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,032
Even if it folds out of town,
it's the kind of part that gets noticed.

306
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,041
Mrs. Castevet was here...

307
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,710
to thank me for what I said about Terry.

308
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,713
She is the nosiest person I've ever seen.

309
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,925
You know she actually asked
the prices of things?

310
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,469
- No kidding.
- Mm.

311
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,514
She invited us to have dinner with them tonight.

312
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,975
I told her I'd have to check with you
but that it'd probably be okay.

313
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,145
Oh, Jesus.
We don't have to do that, do we, honey?

314
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,939
I think they're Ionely.

315
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,067
We get friendly with an old couple like that,
we'll never get rid of them.

316
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,152
They're right across the wall.

317
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,446
I told her she could count on us.

318
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,952
- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.

319
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,204
I see exactly what you mean.

320
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,374
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

321
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,211
- We'll go!
- No, we don't have to if you don't want to.

322
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,380
That sounds so phony, but I really mean it.

323
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,757
Really, I do.

324
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,385
Be my good deed for today.

325
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,888
Okay, but only if you want to.

326
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,391
And we'll make it clear
it's just for this one night...

327
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,935
and not the beginning of anything, right?

328
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,063
Ah, perfect timing!
Come on in.

329
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,315
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.

330
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,401
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.

331
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,987
I'm fixin' to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

332
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,490
Look, dinner isn't ready just yet,
but sit down there anywhere, love.

333
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,701
Take a seat on the couch.
You're gonna find yourself very...

334
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,537
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.

335
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,247
No, no, no. Don't get up.

336
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,834
Generally I pour these out precisely
as a bartender. Don't I, Minnie?

337
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,921
- Just watch the carpet.
- But this evening I made a little too much...

338
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,674
Ah, there we are.
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

339
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,718
- Now, Mrs. Woodhouse.
- Thank you.

340
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,596
Mr. Woodhouse,
uh, vodka blush?

341
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,931
- Yes, thanks.
- Have you ever tasted one?

342
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,225
- No, no, I haven't.
- It looks delicious.

343
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,936
Minnie.
They're very popular in Australia.

344
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,398
Now, to our guests.
Welcome to our home.

345
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,774
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

346
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
- -

347
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,572
The carpet!

348
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,533
- Oh, dear.
- Brand-new carpet.

349
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,953
This man's so clumsy!

350
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,956
- Do you come from Australia?
- Oh, no, no.

351
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,543
I'm from right here in New York City.
I've been there, though.

352
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,629
I've been everywhere, literally.

353
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,089
You name a place, and I've been there.

354
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,884
- Go ahead. Name a place.
- Fairbanks, Alaska.

355
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,803
I've been there.
Been all over Alaska.

356
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,223
Yes, Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage...

357
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,016
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

358
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,061
- I spent four months there in '38.
- Where are you folks from?

359
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,729
- Well...
- Well, I...

360
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,023
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

361
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,734
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is too.

362
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,363
- Do you travel for business?
- Well, business and pleasure both.

363
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,824
I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was ten.

364
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,868
You name a place, I've been there.

365
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,330
Ah! Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks, now.

366
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,082
Roman, take your pill.

367
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,795
No pope ever visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

368
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,339
I heard he's gonna postpone
and wait till it's over.

369
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,051
Well, that's showbiz.

370
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,053
That's exactly what it is.

371
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,181
All the costumes, the rituals...
all religions.

372
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,725
Oh, oh, I think we're offendin' Rosemary.

373
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,561
- No. No.
- You're not religious, my dear, are you?

374
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,731
Well, I-I was brought up a Catholic.
Now I don't know.

375
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,193
- Yeah. You looked uncomfortable.
- Well, he is the pope.

376
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,529
Well, now, you don't need
to have respect for him...

377
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,531
because he pretends that he's holy.

378
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,366
Now, that's a good point.

379
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,327
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

380
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,206
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion...

381
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,208
was given, I thought, in Luther.

382
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,669
Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?

383
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,337
Me? No.

384
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,715
Well, weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?

385
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,717
- No.
- Well, that's strange.

386
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,136
I remember being struck by a gesture you made...

387
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,763
and checking in the program to see who you were.

388
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,224
- Thank you.
- Um, what gesture was that?

389
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,728
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction, uh...

390
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,856
I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

391
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,818
- It was a kind of involuntary reaching.
- That's it. That's it.

392
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,488
- It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
- Come on, now.

393
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,324
No, no. I mean it.

394
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,118
My father was a theatrical producer...

395
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,495
and my early years were spent in the company...

396
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,415
of Mrs. Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

397
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,917
- Guy?
- Oh, yes, please.

398
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,546
You have a most interesting inner quality, Guy.

399
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,633
It appears in your television work too.
It should take you a long way indeed...

400
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,596
provided, of course,
that you get those initial breaks.

401
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,724
Are you preparing for a show now?

402
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,268
Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts.

403
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,438
- Well, I can't believe
that you won't get them.
- Well, I can.

404
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,067
I'd like to have a spice garden someday.

405
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,527
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

406
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,531
- You come from a big family?
- Mm-hmm. Three brothers and two sisters.

407
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,909
- Your sisters married?
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,287
- They have children?
- One has two. The other has four.

409
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,165
Well, there's a chance
you'll have lots of children too.

410
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,250
Oh, we're fertile, all right.

411
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,544
I've got 16 nieces and nephews.

412
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,505
My goodness!

413
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,012
Would you like me to wash,
and you can wipe for a while?

414
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,139
Oh, no. This is fine, dear.

415
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,610
Now, Roman, will you stop bending
Guy's ears with your Modjeska stories?

416
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,779
He's only listening 'cause he's polite.

417
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,906
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castevet.

418
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,118
- You see?
- Minnie. I'm Minnie, he's Roman. Okay?

419
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,328
- Okay?
- Okay.

420
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,664
Okay.
Terrific. Just terrific.

421
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,958
- Good-bye, darlin'. Good-bye.
- Thank you for having us.

422
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,627
- Yeah, it was lovely. Bless you.
- Minnie!

423
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,879
Minnie! Ya great kid, ya!

424
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,507
Whoo!
About that steak, huh?

425
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,844
Oh, my God! And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?

426
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,387
- It was weird!
- Out of politeness.

427
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,639
That's how I ate two pieces...
out of politeness.

428
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,395
- Only three dinner plates that match...
- Shh!

429
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,440
And all that beautiful, beautiful silver.

430
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,942
- We'll be nice. Maybe they'll will it to us.
- Oh!

431
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,569
Yeah.

432
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,530
- Guess what they have in their bathroom.
- A bidet.

433
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,657
- Jokes for the John.
- No.

434
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,243
A book on a hook, right next to the toilet.

435
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,122
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.

436
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,876
Never even heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

437
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm gonna go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.

438
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,922
- You are?
- Yeah. He asked me.

439
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,883
Here, do this damn thing for me, will you?

440
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,260
I thought we were gonna do something
with Joan and Dick Jellico.

441
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,220
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.

442
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,347
We'll see them next week.

443
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,893
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to, you know.

444
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,854
You can stay here.

445
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,440
I think I will stay here.

446
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,777
He knew Henry Irving too.
I mean, really interesting, huh?

447
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,864
Why did they take their pictures down?

448
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,075
- What do you mean?
- Their pictures... they took them down.

449
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,828
There are hooks in the wall and clean spaces...

450
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,414
and the one picture that is there doesn't fit.

451
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,166
I didn't notice that.

452
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,331
Hi, dear.
We're not botherin' ya, are we?

453
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,251
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney. Lives up on 12.

454
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,628
Laura-Louise,
this is Guy's wife, Rosemary.

455
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,880
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram.

456
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,466
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you too.

457
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,594
- Could we come in?
- Uh, of... of course. Please do.

458
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,930
Well, there you are.
Go ahead.

459
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,099
Look at the...

460
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,560
Oh! Gosh!

461
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,770
Isn't that beautiful?

462
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,940
- It came this morning.
- Are you all right, dear? You look worn.

463
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,693
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.

464
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,237
And you're up and around?
On my first day...

465
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:50,283
I experienced such pain,
I couldn't move, eat, or anything.

466
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,327
Dan used to give me gin
through a straw to kill the pain.

467
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,372
Girls today take things
much more in their stride.

468
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,499
They're much healthier than we were...

469
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,960
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care...

470
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,004
What are those things over there?
Seat covers?

471
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,006
Um, cushions for the window seats.

472
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,882
Oh, yeah.

473
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,557
Oh, before I forget...

474
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,892
this is for you, from Roman and me.

475
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,686
For me?

476
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,355
It's just a little present, is all.
For movin' in.

477
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,942
- There's no reason...
- It's real old. It's over 300 years.

478
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,368
It's lovely.

479
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,413
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.

480
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,749
That's for good luck.

481
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,043
It's lovely, but I can't accept it.

482
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,837
- You already have. Put it on.
- Yeah.

483
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,676
You'll get used to the smell before you know it.

484
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,887
Yeah, go on.

485
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,141
Ah, yeah.

486
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,978
Were his stories as interesting as last night?

487
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,064
Yes.
Did you have a good time?

488
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,691
All right. I got a present.

489
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,571
- It was Terry's.
- No kidding.

490
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,657
Kind of pretty, though.

491
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,747
- Aren't you gonna wear it?
- Mm-mm. It smells.

492
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,667
There's stuff in it called tannis root
from her greenhouse.

493
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,252
Not too bad, though.

494
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,306
- Tannis, anyone?
- Well, if you took it...

495
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,767
you ought to wear it.

496
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,911
Hello?

497
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,955
Yes. This is he.

498
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,131
Oh. God, no.

499
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,553
Oh, the poor guy.

500
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,556
And, uh, they don't have
any idea what's causing it?

501
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,184
- No, not yet.
- My God, that's awful. That's just awful.

502
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,520
We'd like to know if you'd be interested...

503
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,480
Yes, I would.

504
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,524
I mean, yes, I am.

505
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,319
I hate to get it that way, but...

506
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,367
Well, you'd have to speak
to my agent about that end of it.

507
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,495
Allan Stone.

508
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss, not as far as we're concerned.

509
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,794
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

510
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,675
Guy?

511
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,678
What is it?

512
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,643
Donald Baumgart... he's gone blind.

513
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,563
He woke up yesterday, and he can't see.

514
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,108
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I've got the part.

515
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,361
Well, it's a hell of a way to get it.

516
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,703
Listen, uh, I have to get out and walk around.

517
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,747
Yeah, I understand.
Go ahead.

518
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,136
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.

519
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,808
It's a fascinating part.
He'll really be noticed this time.

520
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,937
He also has an offer for a lead
in a television series: Miami Beach.

521
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,022
He's suddenly very hot.

522
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,275
Mm, now I understand why you're so overjoyed.

523
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,821
Well, it's a difficult period in his life.

524
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,114
A challenge.

525
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,783
I see.

526
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,203
You know how actors are.
They're all a bit self-centered.

527
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,207
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
is vain and self-centered.

528
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,212
It's a difficult part.
He's got to work with crutches...

529
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,715
and naturally he's preoccupied...

530
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,094
and he... well, preoccupied.

531
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,266
I say, you had another suicide
up there at Happy House.

532
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,018
- Oh, didn't I tell you?
- No, you didn't.

533
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,646
It was that girl I told you about:
The drug addict...

534
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,982
who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.

535
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,859
I'm sure I told you that.

536
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,112
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully, it seems.

537
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,969
I've been a creep.

538
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,306
It's from worrying if Baumgart
would regain his sight, rat that I am.

539
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,225
Well, it's natural.
You're bound to feel two ways about it.

540
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,352
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
for the rest of my days...

541
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,479
I'm gonna stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

542
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,315
- You haven't been.
- Yes, I have.

543
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,775
I've been tearing my hair out over my career.

544
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,486
Let's have a baby, all right?

545
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,698
Let's have three babies,
one at a time, all right?

546
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,285
A baby. You know...
"Mama, Dada, poo-poo." You know?

547
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,288
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it. Sure, I mean it.

548
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,707
I even figured out
the right time to start. Look.

549
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,003
You really mean it? Really?

550
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,047
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.

551
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,800
Oh, Ro, honey, for God sakes,
don't cry, all right?

552
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,386
Oh, no. I won't.

553
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,517
Here goes nothin'.

554
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,115
Mm, mm, mm!
The paint! The paint!

555
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,951
Good grief.

556
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,712
Nobody, but nobody, has a fire tonight.

557
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,553
Isn't it gorgeous?

558
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,098
I hope we have the coldest winter ever.

559
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,032
Aw, shit!

560
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,833
- Hi, Guy. How are ya?
- Oh, hello.

561
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,585
No. Don't let her in.
Not tonight.

562
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,261
Oh, you sure you don't want to come in?

563
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,347
No.

564
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:17,104
Good.

565
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,148
Who says there's nothing to ESP?

566
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,151
Madame et Monsieur
shall have ze dessert after all!

567
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,945
Mousse au chocolat...
or as Minnie calls it...

568
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,322
"chocolate mouse."

569
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,575
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.

570
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,618
Oh, she just wanted us to try it.

571
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,246
Seein' it's one of her speci-al-ities.

572
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,041
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.

573
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,585
Yeah you're right.
You're right. Mm-hmm.

574
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,474
Mmm. It's good.

575
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,991
Has an under-taste.

576
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,328
A chalky under-taste.

577
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,956
I don't get it.

578
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,668
That's silly, honey.
There is no under-taste.

579
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,171
There is.

580
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,673
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

581
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,051
- I don't like it.
- It's delicious.

582
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,053
Here. You can have mine.

583
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,430
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.

584
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,975
Oh, if it's gonna turn into a big thing...

585
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,019
If you really can't stand it, just don't eat it.

586
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,355
Mmm. It's delicious.

587
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,398
No under-taste at all.

588
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,402
Would you turn the record over, please?

589
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,418
There, Daddy.
Do I get a gold star?

590
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,462
You get two of them.

591
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,841
- I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
- You were.

592
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,094
... is making a full circle of the park...
- It's the pope at Yankee Stadium!

593
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,430
- Walking to his specially built
canopy at second base.
- Christ, what a mob!

594
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,432
Listen to that crowd roar.

595
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,061
Everywhere the pope has been today
he has received this type of reception.

596
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,230
As one nun put it this afternoon...

597
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,817
"Perhaps we are being undignified,
but this is a special day."

598
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,735
And a special day it has been.

599
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:32,906
That's a great spot for my Yamaha commercial.

600
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,327
We'd like to give you a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.

601
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,540
Pope Paul VI arrived
at 9:27 a.m. This morning...

602
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,169
What is it?

603
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,171
Dizzy.

604
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,552
Hey.

605
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,181
No wonder.

606
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,641
You had all that booze in you.

607
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,936
Probably didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

608
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,279
Hey.

609
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,428
Nice.

610
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,765
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.

611
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,767
We have to make a baby.

612
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,894
Oh, well...

613
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,812
we'll-we'll do it.

614
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,649
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time, hmm?

615
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,734
Just a nap.

616
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,857
Why are you taking them off?

617
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,193
To make you more comfortable.

618
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,654
I am more comfortable.

619
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,698
Sleep, Ro.

620
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,364
Isn't Hutch coming with us?

621
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,742
Catholics only.

622
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,370
I wish we weren't bound by these prejudices...

623
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,748
but unfortunately...

624
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,629
Easy, easy.
You've got her too high.

625
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,382
Typhoon! Typhoon!

626
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,468
It killed 55 people in London...

627
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,312
You'd better go down below, miss.

628
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,794
- She's awake. She sees.
- She don't see.

629
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,631
As long as she ate the "mouse," she can't
see nor hear. She's like dead. Now sing.

630
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,228
I'm sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.

631
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,397
It's only the mouse bite.

632
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,192
You'd better have your legs tied down...

633
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,235
in case of convulsions.

634
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,156
Yes, I suppose so.

635
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,158
There's always a chance it was rabid.

636
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,368
If the music bothers you, let me know...

637
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,746
and I'll have it stopped.

638
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,748
Oh, no, no, no, no.

639
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,584
Please don't change the program on my account.

640
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,794
Try to sleep.

641
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,631
We'll be waiting up on deck.

642
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,380
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

643
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,183
They tell me you have been bitten by a mouse.

644
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,311
Yes. That's why
I couldn't come to see you.

645
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,313
Oh, that's all right.

646
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,483
We wouldn't want you to jeopardize your health.

647
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,653
Am I forgiven, Father?

648
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,614
Oh, absolutely.

649
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,296
Hey, it's after 9:00.

650
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,635
Five minutes.

651
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,096
I have to be at Allan's at 10:00.

652
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,350
- Eat out.
- The hell I will!

653
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,738
What time is it?

654
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,699
It's, uh, ten after 9:00.

655
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,701
What time did I go to sleep?

656
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,204
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.

657
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,373
Uh, from now on you get...

658
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:23,710
cocktails or wine, not cocktails and wine, huh?

659
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,046
The dreams I had!

660
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,595
Don't yell.
I already filed 'em down.

661
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,057
I didn't want to miss baby night.

662
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,018
- You... While I was out?
- And a couple of my nails
were ragged...

663
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:44,064
and it was kind of fun
in a necrophile sort of way.

664
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,278
- - I dreamed someone was raping me.

665
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,447
I don't know.
Someone inhuman.

666
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,532
Thanks a lot!

667
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,037
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

668
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,249
I didn't want to miss the night.

669
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:06,419
We could've done it this morning or tonight.

670
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,922
Last night wasn't the only split second.

671
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,675
Well, I was a little bit loaded
myself, you know.

672
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,489
- Oh, hello there. Did you like it?
- Oh, yes.

673
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,033
I think I put a little too much
crème de cacao in it.

674
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,411
No, no. It was delicious.
You'll have to give me the recipe.

675
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,830
Yeah, I'd love to.
Listen, you goin' shoppin'?

676
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,958
Do me a little teeny favor, will ya?
Get me six eggs, a small Instant Sanka.

677
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,877
- I'm gonna pay you later, huh?
- All right. Bye-bye.

678
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,806
Don't you think we ought to talk about it?

679
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,516
About what?

680
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,435
The way you haven't been looking at me.

681
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,353
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.

682
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,982
- You haven't.
- Why, sure I have.

683
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,317
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?

684
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,029
Nothing. Never mind.

685
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,282
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?

686
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,659
Nothing.

687
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,287
Look, honey, I know I've been preoccupied...

688
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,414
with the part and all, but it is important.

689
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,666
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

690
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,224
It was due on Friday.

691
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,187
- It was?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,857
- It'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
- Wanna bet?

693
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,442
- Yeah.
- A quarter.

694
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,319
- Okay.
- You're gonna lose.

695
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,821
Shut up, will ya?
You're getting me all jumpy.

696
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,115
It's only been two days.

697
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,034
When will I know?

698
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,286
I'll call you just as soon as I get the results.

699
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:07,081
I like to do a general examination
just to know something more.

700
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,461
It was Elise Dunstan
who recommended you to me, Doctor.

701
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,713
- Oh, yes. How is she?
- She's fine.

702
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,341
And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?

703
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,385
No, just the last.
Universal hemoglobin.

704
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,262
Yes, Doctor.

705
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,903
- We went to see The Fantasticks.
- Oh, did you?

706
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,696
- Mm.
- Did you enjoy it?

707
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,740
- Yeah.
- Good.

708
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,832
- Hello?
- Mrs. Woodhouse?

709
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,459
- Dr. Hill?
- Congratulations.

710
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,545
- Really?
- Really.

711
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,298
Are you there?

712
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,926
Uh, yes.
Um, what happens now?

713
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,053
Very little.
You come see me next month...

714
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,264
and you get those Natalin pills...
one a day.

715
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,976
- I'll mail you forms for the hospital.
- Uh, when will it be?

716
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:11,354
Uh, it works out to be June 28.

717
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,481
- That sounds so far away.
- It is.

718
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,525
- Yeah.
- Oh, one more thing, Mrs. Woodhouse.

719
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:19,487
- We'd like another blood sample.
- Oh, yes, of course.

720
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,323
- What for?
- Uh, the nurse didn't take enough.

721
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:26,160
- So would you drop by and see her?
- But I-I am pregnant, aren't I?

722
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,289
Oh, yes. It's just
for blood sugar and so forth.

723
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,958
Nothing to be concerned about.
You're pregnant. Don't worry.

724
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,460
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.

725
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,880
- All right. Now, don't forget the pills.
- No, I won't.

726
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,257
- Good-bye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
- Good-bye, Dr. Hill.

727
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,927
Blood sugar?

728
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,195
What's that?

729
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:07,285
Oh! That's great!
That's just great!

730
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,121
- Father.
- Ah, Mother.

731
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,917
- - Guy... Guy, listen.

732
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,836
Let's, uh, make this a new beginning, okay?

733
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,047
A new openness and talking to each other...

734
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,174
because we haven't been open.

735
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,719
It's true. I've been
so goddamned self-centered.

736
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,804
That's what the whole trouble is.

737
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,140
And you know I love you,
don't you, Ro? I do.

738
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,352
- I swear to God I'm gonna be as open...
- It's my fault as much as yours.

739
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,520
No, bull! It's mine.
Now, you bear with me...

740
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,564
and I'm gonna try and do better, you hear?

741
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,524
Oh, Guy!

742
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,036
What?

743
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,373
Fine way for parents to be carrying on.

744
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,459
Hey, you know what I'd love to do?

745
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,963
- What?
- Tell Minnie and Roman.

746
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:02,924
Oh, I know, I know. It's, uh...

747
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,426
it's, uh, supposed to be a deep, dark secret...

748
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,013
but I've already told them that we were trying.

749
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,724
They were so pleased.

750
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,726
Tell them.

751
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,561
- Back in two minutes?
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,574
You're pregnant.

753
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,704
Another blood sample.

754
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,291
- ♪ Ta-da ♪
- Now, that's what I call good news!

755
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,169
Ah, honey, congratulations!

756
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,964
- Thank you.
- Our best wishes, Rosemary.

757
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,800
- Thank you very much.
- We are more pleased than we can say.

758
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,262
We didn't have any champagne on hand,
but this will do just as nicely.

759
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,473
- When are you due, dear?
- June 28.

760
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,268
Oh, it's gonna be so exciting.
Listen, dear, you got a good doctor?

761
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,061
Oh, yes, a very good one.

762
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,480
One of the top obstetricians
is a dear friend of ours.

763
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,483
Abe Sapirstein.
Delivers all the society babies.

764
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,862
Abe Sapirstein? One of the finest
obstetricians in the country.

765
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,947
Wasn't he on Open End a couple of years ago?

766
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,741
That's right.

767
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,076
- Ro?
- Uh...

768
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,454
- Well, what about Dr. Hill?
- Don't worry about Hill.

769
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,539
I'll tell him something.
You know me.

770
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,959
Listen, I won't let you go to no Dr. Hill
nobody ever heard of.

771
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,253
The best is what you're gonna have, young lady.

772
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,131
- Where's your telephone, huh?
- It's in the bedroom.

773
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,967
He's a brilliant man.
Very sensitive.

774
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,262
- Ro, sit down, sit down!
- No, I'm fine.

775
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,848
Abe? Minnie. Fine.

776
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,435
Listen, Abe, a dear friend of ours
just found out today she's pregnant.

777
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,313
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.

778
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,440
We told her you'd be glad to take care of her.

779
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,985
You wouldn't charge her none
of your fancy society prices, neither.

780
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,197
Uh-huh. Just wait a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11:00?

781
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,617
- All right.
- Yeah, 11:00's fine, Abe.

782
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,453
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, you too.

783
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,663
No. No, no, no. Not at all.

784
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,625
All right. Well, let's hope so.
Good-bye.

785
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:04,462
- Well, there you are.
- Hey, thanks a million, Minnie.

786
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,506
Yes, I don't know how to thank you, both of you.

787
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,841
Just have a fine, healthy baby, that's all.

788
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,345
My, I can't wait
to tell Laura-Louise.

789
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,347
Oh, uh...

790
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,933
please don't tell anyone else, not right away.

791
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,685
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

792
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,438
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.

793
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,440
- Hear, hear!
- Hear!

794
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,819
Andy?

795
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,739
Or Susan?

796
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,992
Susan!

797
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,748
Please don't read books.

798
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:27,086
No pregnancy was ever exactly
like the ones described in the books.

799
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,922
And don't listen to your friends either.

800
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,217
No two pregnancies are ever alike.

801
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,220
- Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
- No pills.

802
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,640
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.

803
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,519
I'm gonna have her make a daily drink
for you that'll be fresher, safer...

804
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,147
and more vitamin-rich
than any pills on the market.

805
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,401
Any questions you have, call me night or day.

806
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,404
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

807
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,907
- Here.
- What's in it?

808
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,910
Snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails.

809
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,120
That's fine, but what if we want a girl?

810
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,955
Do you?

811
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:07,043
- It'd be nice if the first one were a boy.
- Well, there you are.

812
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:14,217
- No, really, what is in it?
- A raw egg, gelatin, herbs...

813
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,135
Tannis root?

814
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,096
Some of that, along with some other things.

815
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,140
Don't be so violent, Harry.

816
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,101
If you want to be stupid, be nonviolent stupid.

817
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:28,105
I'm in love with no one,
especially not your fat wife.

818
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,274
I'm a hopeless cripple...

819
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,486
What's that?

820
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,740
I've been to Vidal Sassoon.

821
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,909
Don't tell me you paid for that.

822
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,038
Guy, I have a pain.

823
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,666
- Where?
- In here.

824
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:51,003
- Just now?
- Since Monday. A sharp pain.

825
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,631
- Did you see Sapirstein?
- I'm seeing him on Wednesday.

826
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,342
This is ridiculous!
Why didn't you see Sapirstein?

827
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:00,346
- I mean, why didn't you say anything?
- I see him Wednesday, regular.

828
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,057
An entirely natural expansion of the pelvis.

829
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,059
You can fight it with ordinary aspirin.

830
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,728
I was afraid it might be an ectopic pregnancy.

831
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,357
"Ectopic"? I thought you weren't
gonna read books, Rosemary.

832
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:14,568
- It was staring at me in the drugstore.
- And all it did was worry you.

833
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,570
Will you go home and throw it away, please?

834
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,865
- I will. I promise.
- The pains will be gone in two days.

835
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,867
Ectopic pregnancy!

836
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,580
I look awful.

837
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,709
What are you talking about?
You look great.

838
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,712
It's that haircut that looks awful.

839
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:18,674
If you want the truth, honey,
that's the worst mistake you ever made.

840
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,044
My God!

841
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,630
It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very "in."

842
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,632
What's wrong with you?

843
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,176
- Do I look that bad?
- Terrible!

844
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,470
You're not on one of those Zen diets, are you?

845
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,514
- No.
- Then what is it?

846
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,599
Have you seen a doctor?

847
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,310
Hutch, I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.

848
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,978
Oh, rubbish!

849
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,898
Pregnant women gain weight, they don't lose it.

850
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,983
I don't sleep well.

851
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,653
I have stiff joints or something,
so I get a pain.

852
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,488
Nothing serious.

853
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:26,075
Well, congratulations.
You must be very happy.

854
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,702
Oh, I am. We both are.

855
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:32,373
- Who's your obstetrician?
- Abraham Sapirstein.

856
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,334
Oh! He delivered
two of my daughter's babies.

857
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,671
- He's one of the best in the city.
- When did you see him last?

858
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,382
- Um, yesterday.
- And?

859
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,718
And he says it's fairly common.

860
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,513
How much weight have you lost?

861
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,682
About, uh, three pounds.

862
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,685
Oh, nonsense.
You've lost far more than that.

863
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,020
It's perfectly normal to lose a little at first.

864
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,231
Later on I'll be gaining.

865
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,024
Well...

866
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,069
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.

867
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,530
He should.
He charges enough.

868
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,533
We're getting bargain rates.
Our neighbors are close friends of his.

869
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,452
- - I'll go.

870
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,371
No, no. Stay where you are.
Hurts less when I move around.

871
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,543
Oh, I was just talking about you.

872
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,421
Favorably, I hope.
Do you need anything from outside?

873
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,924
- No. Thank you for asking.
- Is Guy home already?

874
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,719
- No, he won't be home till 6:00.
- Oh.

875
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,472
A friend of ours is here.

876
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,557
Would you...
Would you like to meet him?

877
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:35,060
- Well, if I won't be intruding.
- No, no. Please come in.

878
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:49,116
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.

879
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,118
- Edward Hutchins.
- How do you do?

880
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,329
- How are you, sir?
- I was just telling Hutch...

881
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,706
it was you and Minnie
who sent me to Dr. Sapirstein.

882
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,000
So Rosemary has told you the good news?

883
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,920
- Yes, she has.
- We must see she gets plenty of rest.

884
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,088
I was a bit alarmed by her appearance.

885
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,842
Well, she has lost some weight,
but that's quite normal for the early months.

886
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,470
Later on, she'll gain...
probably far too much.

887
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,223
- So I gather.
- Please sit down.

888
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:16,143
Mrs. Castevet makes a vitamin drink for me
every day from fresh herbs she grows.

889
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,730
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's
directions, of course.

890
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,859
He's inclined to be suspicious
of commercially prepared vitamin pills.

891
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,278
Is he indeed?
Why, surely they're manufactured...

892
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,364
under every imaginable safeguard.

893
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,491
That's quite true, but commercial pills...

894
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,618
can sit for months on a druggist's shelf...

895
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,079
and lose a great deal of their original potency.

896
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:39,458
- I hadn't thought of that.
- I like the idea of having
everything fresh and natural.

897
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,628
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root...

898
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,880
when nobody'd even heard of vitamin pills.

899
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:48,342
- Tannis root?
- It's one of the herbs she puts in the drink.

900
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,469
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?

901
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,013
You sure you don't mean anise or orris root?

902
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,599
- No, tannis.
- Hmm.

903
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,394
Look.

904
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,897
It's good luck too.

905
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,946
It doesn't look like root matter.

906
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,824
More like mold or fungus of some kind.

907
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,620
- Is it ever called by any other name?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

908
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,497
Hmm.

909
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,917
"Tannis"...I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.

910
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,378
What a pretty holder or charm or whatever it is.

911
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,463
The Castevets gave it to me.

912
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,467
You and your wife seem to be taking
better care of Rosemary than her own parents.

913
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,761
We're very fond of her, and of Guy too.

914
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,014
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to go.

915
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,017
- My wife is waiting for me.
- It's a pleasure to have met you.

916
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,727
Don't bother, Rosemary.

917
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,521
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

918
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,651
I've just noticed he has pierced ears.

919
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,738
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.

920
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,449
What's she like?

921
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,743
Nosy. Funny.

922
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,745
Guy's gotten very close to them.

923
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,081
I suppose they've become
sort of parent figures for him.

924
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,210
And you?

925
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,212
I... I don't know.

926
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:10,549
Sometimes I think
they're too friendly and helpful.

927
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,219
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.

928
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,096
You're the surprise.
What happened?

929
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,058
They stopped for a rewrite, those dumb bastards.

930
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,268
Uh, stay where you are.
Nobody move.

931
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,896
- Would you like some coffee?
- Love some!

932
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,111
Loot.

933
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,280
It seems congratulations are in order.

934
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,574
- Yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?
- When's the baby due?

935
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,368
June 28.

936
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:41,080
Did you know that Dr. Sapirstein
delivered two of Hutch's grandchildren?

937
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,623
- Really?
- Mm.

938
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,334
I met your neighbor...
Roman Castevet.

939
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,795
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?

940
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,130
Guy, did you ever notice he has pierced ears?

941
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,299
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not. I saw.

942
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,177
It's a shame we haven't seen
more of you lately, Hutch...

943
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:59,056
but with me so busy and Ro the way she is,
we really haven't seen anyone.

944
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:02,017
- Perhaps we can have dinner together soon.
- You're not going, are you?

945
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,270
- Thanks for the coffee, my dear.
- Thank you for coming, my dear.

946
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,112
- This isn't mine. It must be yours.
- Right you are.

947
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,739
Have you thought about names, or is it too soon?

948
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,951
Andrew or Douglas if it's a boy.
Melinda or Sarah if it's a girl.

949
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,953
"Sarah"?
What happened to "Susan"?

950
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,372
Say, is there another of these around?

951
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,207
Oh.

952
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,380
- I don't see it, Hutch.
- No, it's not here.

953
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:34,383
Hmm. Oh, probably left
at the City Center.

954
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,636
I'll stop back there.
Let's really have that dinner, shall we?

955
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,471
- Definitely.
- Next week.

956
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,140
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

957
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,142
- Bye.
- Bye.

958
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,568
It was a nice surprise.

959
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,320
Guess what he said.

960
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:58,282
- What?
- I look terrible.

961
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,869
Oh, good old Hutch.
He's spreading cheer wherever he goes.

962
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,913
I'm gonna get a paper, honey.

963
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,333
- He's a professional crepe-hanger.
- He's not a professional crepe-hanger.

964
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,003
Then he's one
of the top-ranking amateurs.

965
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,423
- -

966
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:26,518
Hello? Oh, uh, no.
She's not feeling too well.

967
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,980
I think she's asleep.

968
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,065
Oh, I wouldn't...

969
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,152
Well, she could be, yeah.
She wasn't feeling well.

970
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,237
All right.
Can you hold on a minute?

971
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,075
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.

972
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,869
Oh.

973
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,039
I told him you were resting,
but he said it couldn't wait.

974
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:58,467
- Hutch?
- Tell me, dear, do you go out at all?

975
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,970
Well, I-I haven't been going out.
Why?

976
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:05,974
Can you meet me tomorrow morning
at 11:00 in front of the Time-Life Building?

977
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,060
If you want me to.

978
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:11,063
- What is it? Can't you tell me now?
- I'd rather not.

979
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,440
We can have an early lunch, if you'd like.

980
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,734
- That would be nice.
- Good. 11:00, then?

981
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,403
Okay.
Oh, did you find your glove?

982
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,531
No, they didn't have it.
Good night, Rosemary.

983
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,116
- Sleep well.
- You too. Good night.

984
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:26,453
- What was that?
- He wants to talk to me.

985
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,581
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.

986
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,377
I think those boys' adventure
stories are going to his head.

987
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,798
Where are you meeting him?

988
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,677
Uh, Time and Life Building
tomorrow at 11:00.

989
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,139
This is ridiculous.

990
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,976
You're pregnant... I've got the yens.
I'm gonna get an ice-cream cone. Want one?

991
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,728
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- Vanilla?

992
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,814
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.

993
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,422
- Hi!
- Hi. Minnie, I'm going out now...

994
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,300
- so I won't have my drink at 11:00.
- That's fine, dear.

995
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,052
Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?

996
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,809
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

997
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,416
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.

998
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,205
- Yes?
- Is this Edward Hutchins's apartment?

999
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,208
- Yes. Who is this, please?
- My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1000
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,294
I had an appointment
with Mr. Hutchins. Is he there?

1001
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,632
- Hello?
- He was taken ill this morning.

1002
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,135
- "Taken ill"?
- Yes.

1003
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,472
He's in a deep coma
at St. Vincent's Hospital.

1004
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,224
That's awful.

1005
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,686
I just spoke to him
last night about 10:30.

1006
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,896
I spoke to him at 11:00.

1007
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,691
- Who is this?
- You don't know me, Rosemary.

1008
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,110
I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.

1009
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,654
And do they...
do they know what's causing it?

1010
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:09,241
No, they don't know yet.
At the moment, he's totally unresponsive.

1011
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,703
- Oh, my God.
- I'm going to the hospital now.

1012
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,288
- Is there anything I can do?
- Not really.

1013
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,584
All right. Um, thank you.

1014
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:51,783
Now, this is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

1015
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,744
Oh, God!

1016
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,788
I said to myself,
"As long as Rosemary's goin' out...

1017
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,958
I might as well go out and do
a little bit of Christmas shoppin'."

1018
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,503
And now here you are and here I am.
Isn't that somethin'?

1019
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,132
Aw, darlin', what's the matter?
You feel all right?

1020
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,636
Aw. Aw, you poor thing.

1021
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,723
You know what I think?
I think we better be goin' home now.

1022
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:18,143
- What do ya say?
- No, no. You have your shopping to do.

1023
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,772
Aw, shoot. There's two more weeks.

1024
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,664
It'll stop any day now.

1025
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,834
It's like a wire inside me
getting tighter and tighter.

1026
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,836
Usually, older women...

1027
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,839
with less flexible joints
have this sort of trouble.

1028
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,634
- I'm not going out anymore.
- You don't have to.

1029
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,221
One minute to go!

1030
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,723
Rosemary, I want you
to meet Dr. Shand.

1031
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,602
He used to be a famous dentist.
He made the chain for your charm.

1032
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,687
Oh. How do you do?

1033
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:05,565
Yeah. Come on, sweetie.
Put this hat on your head.

1034
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,692
Doctor, it looks great.
Come over here.

1035
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,820
- Minnie, Minnie!
- Thank you.

1036
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,488
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1037
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,573
- - Happy New Year.

1038
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:19,162
- - To 1966!

1039
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,706
The Year One!

1040
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,760
What the hell are you doing?

1041
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,929
Planning the menu.

1042
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:21,600
We're having a party a week from Saturday.

1043
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,936
It's for our old fr...
I mean, our young friends.

1044
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,314
Minnie and Roman are not invited.

1045
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,692
Neither is Laura-Louise.
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.

1046
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:34,571
It's gonna be a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.

1047
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,746
Well!

1048
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,290
For a minute there,
I didn't think I was going to make it.

1049
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,418
Oh, you'll make it, all right.
You can be a bartender.

1050
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,795
Oh, swell.

1051
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,964
Do you really think it's such a good idea?

1052
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,717
I think it's the best idea I've had in months.

1053
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,678
Don't you think you ought to check
with Dr. Sapirstein first?

1054
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,140
What for? I'm just giving a party.
I'm not gonna swim the English Channel.

1055
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:03,725
What about the pain?

1056
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:09,439
Oh, haven't you heard?
It'll go away in a day or two.

1057
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,983
That looks interesting. What's it for?

1058
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,444
We're having some people over on Saturday.

1059
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,197
- Oh, you feel up to entertaining?
- Yes, I do.

1060
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,866
These are old friends
I haven't seen in a long time.

1061
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,910
They don't even know yet that I'm pregnant.

1062
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,829
I'll give you a hand if you like.
I can help you dish things out.

1063
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:27,249
No. Thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

1064
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,001
It's gonna be a buffet,
and we're getting a bartender, so...

1065
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,212
Oh. I'll help you take the coats.

1066
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,799
Oh, no, really.
You do too much for me as it is.

1067
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,219
Well, let me know if you change your mind.

1068
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,846
Drink your drink, hon.

1069
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,932
I'd rather not.

1070
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:47,435
Not right this minute.
I'll drink it in a little while.

1071
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,855
- Well, it don't do to let it stand.
- No, I won't wait too long.

1072
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:53,525
You go on back, and I'll bring
the glass back to you later.

1073
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:56,653
- Oh, I'll wait. I'll save you the walk.
- You'll do no such thing.

1074
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:00,573
It makes me very nervous
when people watch me cook. Now scoot.

1075
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,827
Don't let it stand too long.
It's gonna lose its vitamins.

1076
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:17,048
- You dirty, stinkin' secret-keeper!

1077
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:20,093
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1078
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,721
- Thank you.
- Hey, Rosie?

1079
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,015
- Yeah?
- Bob and Lee got stuck...

1080
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,309
at another party, dear,
but they'll be over right away.

1081
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:30,437
- Oh, fine.
- - Rosie, you're so lucky.

1082
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,564
- It's a fantastic house!
- I know.

1083
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,571
You look like a piece of chalk!

1084
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,907
You make him feed you, love.

1085
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,496
- Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters too.

1086
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,915
- Trent sisters?
- Trench. They ate little children.

1087
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,335
He doesn't just mean they ate them.

1088
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:55,962
He means they ate them.

1089
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,219
I make the first ones strong to get them happy.

1090
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:06,056
- Then I go light and conserve, eh?
- Rosie, do you feel okay?

1091
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,308
You look a little tired.

1092
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,644
Yeah, well, thanks for the understatement.

1093
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,441
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

1094
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,776
Mm-hmm.

1095
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:21,654
- But I... I'm not going to him.
- You're not?

1096
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:25,784
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein, an older man.

1097
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,787
- Oh, congratulations, Papa.
- Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.

1098
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,789
Ro, I'm gonna take that dip inside, all right?

1099
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,166
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?

1100
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,336
Yeah. Elise, would you
give me a hand with the...

1101
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,380
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1102
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:46,054
Hey, whatever happened
to the other guy? Is he still blind?

1103
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,139
Donald Baumgart?
You know who he is.

1104
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,558
- He's the boy that Zöe Piper lives with.
- Oh, is he the one?

1105
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,769
- Yeah, he's writing a play.
- Is he still blind?

1106
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,187
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

1107
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,107
And he's going through hell
trying to make the adjustment.

1108
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,192
- He dictates and Zöe writes.
- Congratulations!

1109
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,028
- - Can you imagine the courage of this guy?

1110
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,322
He's just blind a few months, you know.

1111
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,077
Are you all right?

1112
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:14,165
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.

1113
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,336
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.

1114
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,257
It's all right, darling. It's all right.
Sit down. Sit down.

1115
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,342
Sit down.

1116
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,264
- Hey, let me in, will ya?
- Sorry. Girls only.

1117
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,266
- I want to talk to Rosemary.
- You can't. She's busy.

1118
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:34,060
- I have to wash these...
- Use the bathroom.

1119
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:42,444
It hurts so much.
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.

1120
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,529
When did the pain start?

1121
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,783
In, uh, November.

1122
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,244
- November?
- What?

1123
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,538
You have been in pain since November...

1124
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,790
and he's not doing anything to help you?

1125
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,959
He says it's gonna stop.

1126
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:02,213
- Why don't you go to see another doctor?
- No, he's very good.

1127
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,257
He was on Open End.

1128
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,926
Well, he sounds like a sadistic nut.

1129
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,637
Rosemary, pain like that is a warning...

1130
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,390
that something isn't right.

1131
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:14,225
Go see Dr. Hill.

1132
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,604
- Go see anybody besides that... that...
- That nut!

1133
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,691
- You can't go on suffering like this.
- I won't have an abortion.

1134
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,818
Nobody's telling you to have an abortion.

1135
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,237
Just go to see another doctor, that's all.

1136
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,415
The thing to do now is move.

1137
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,376
- Guy?
- Yeah?

1138
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,296
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.

1139
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:48,009
Dr. Sapirstein
is either lying, or he's...

1140
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,261
I don't know... out of his mind.

1141
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,931
Pain like this is a warning something's wrong.

1142
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:56,726
- Rosemary...
- And I'm not drinking Minnie's drink anymore.

1143
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,812
I want vitamins in pills like everyone else.

1144
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,192
I haven't drunk it for the last three days.
I've thrown it away.

1145
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:07,195
- You've what?
- I've made my own drink.

1146
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:12,242
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

1147
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,285
Is-Is that their hint for today?

1148
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:17,872
- They're my friends. Don't call them bitches.
- They're a bunch of not-very-bright bitches...

1149
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,999
who ought to mind their own goddamn business!

1150
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,502
All they said was, get a second opinion.

1151
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,587
Rosemary, you got the best doctor in New York.

1152
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:28,383
Do you know who Dr. Hill is?
He's a Charley Nobody. That's who he is!

1153
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:32,387
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr. Sapirstein is.

1154
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,056
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein,
we'll have to pay Hill...

1155
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,058
It's out of the question.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1156
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:41,396
No, I'm not changing. I just want to go
to Dr. Hill and get a second opinion.

1157
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,481
I won't let you do it, Ro.

1158
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,483
I mean, because it's, uh...

1159
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,152
it's not fair to Sapirstein.

1160
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,697
"Not fair to"...

1161
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:54,367
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?

1162
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,452
Look, if you want a second opinion...

1163
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,371
You tell Sapirstein...

1164
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,456
and-and-and let him decide
who gives it.

1165
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,668
No! I want Dr. Hill!
If you won't pay, I'll...

1166
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,379
At least have that much courtesy
to the top man in the field.

1167
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,760
Ro?

1168
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,305
Rosemary? What is it?

1169
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,349
It stopped.

1170
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:20,810
What?

1171
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,354
The pain stopped.
Just like that.

1172
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,815
- "Stopped"?
- Stopped.

1173
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,986
What was in that drink you made?

1174
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:34,198
Um, eggs...

1175
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:37,952
milk, sug... sugar.

1176
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,078
What else?

1177
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:47,462
Rosemary, for chrissakes,
what else was in that drink?

1178
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:51,716
It's alive!

1179
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,718
Guy, it's moving.

1180
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,220
It's alive. It's all right.

1181
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:59,891
- Feel. Feel.
- Oh, yeah. I felt it.

1182
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:03,227
- Don't be scared. It won't bite you.
- Oh, it's wonderful. It's really...

1183
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,606
I feel it kicking.

1184
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,525
It's alive! It's moving!

1185
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,366
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.

1186
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,677
Watch the walls, now, fellas.

1187
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,600
Sort of in the center there.

1188
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:47,397
- Thanks, boys. Have one on the baby.
- Thank you very much.

1189
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:20,638
- What's that for?
- It's my hospital suitcase.

1190
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,141
Honey, you got three weeks.

1191
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,815
Yes?

1192
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,025
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.

1193
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,821
No.

1194
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,948
Oh, my God.

1195
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,493
Oh, my God!

1196
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:44,996
Yes, of course I will.

1197
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,801
Hutch is dead.

1198
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:07,268
I feel awful.
All this time, I didn't even think of him.

1199
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,542
Doctor, good-bye.
Doris, we'll see you later.

1200
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,377
- Good-bye.
- I beg your pardon.

1201
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,421
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

1202
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,382
- Oh, so you're Rosemary.
- I'm terribly sorry.

1203
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,343
Thank you.
This is my sister, Edna.

1204
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,386
- How do you do?
- And my husband.

1205
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,555
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to be late.

1206
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,557
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1207
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:49,185
- I'm Grace Cardiff.
- Oh, I was hoping to meet you.

1208
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,062
Thank you for calling me.

1209
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:53,689
I was going to mail this,
but then I thought you would be here.

1210
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,733
- What is it?
- A book.

1211
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,902
Hutch regained consciousness at the end...

1212
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,029
and he thought it was the next morning.

1213
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,282
- You know, when you had the appointment?
- Oh, yes.

1214
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,409
I wasn't there,
but he told the doctor to make sure...

1215
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:08,996
- that you got the book on his desk.
- Thank you.

1216
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,708
Oh, and I'm to tell you:
The name is an anagram.

1217
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,837
- The name of the book?
- Apparently.

1218
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:18,923
He was delirious, so it's hard to be sure.

1219
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,784
I heard you come in.
It certainly wasn't very long.

1220
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:49,996
- I was late. I couldn't get a taxi.
- Ah, what a shame.

1221
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,415
Oh, you got mail already?

1222
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:54,250
Somebody gave it to me.

1223
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,502
Here. I'll hold it.

1224
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,296
Book?

1225
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,300
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.

1226
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,801
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1227
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,928
Oh, I've been there lots of times.

1228
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,723
"Grace"...that's one
of my favorite names.

1229
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,725
- It is?
- Yeah. You need anything?

1230
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,185
- Nothing, thank you.
- Take a nap, why don't you?

1231
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,938
- I'm going to.
- Yeah. Good-bye.

1232
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,565
"Born in Glasgow in 1846...

1233
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,859
he was soon after brought to New York.

1234
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:05,029
He resided for several years in the United St...

1235
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:08,115
He was attacked
by a mob outside the Bram..."

1236
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,536
Outside. Not in the lobby.

1237
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,924
There are no witches.
Not really.

1238
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,929
"The name is an anagram."

1239
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,889
Now, that really makes sense.

1240
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,601
Poor Hutch.

1241
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,325
Ro?

1242
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,498
What's with the chain?

1243
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,211
What's the matter?

1244
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,881
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1245
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,009
- Oh.
- Oh, thank you.

1246
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,012
- How was the funeral?
- Okay.

1247
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:19,306
I got the shirt that was in The New Yorker.

1248
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,814
I got that shirt that was in The New Yorker.

1249
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,484
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?

1250
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,487
- What do you mean, honey?
- He's Adrian Marcato's son.

1251
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,948
- What?
- Come here.

1252
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,701
I'm gonna show you something.

1253
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:42,663
"Roman Castevet" is "Steven Marcato" rearranged.

1254
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:46,417
It's from Hutch.

1255
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,592
Look.

1256
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:58,053
And look here.
There he is when he was 13.

1257
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,181
See the eyes?

1258
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,643
- A coincidence.
- In the same house?

1259
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,395
And look. Look here.

1260
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,023
"Soon after that, in August 1886...

1261
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,108
his son Steven was born."

1262
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:14,320
1886. Got it?
That makes him 79 now.

1263
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,363
No coincidence.

1264
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,078
No, I guess not.

1265
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:25,915
He's Steven Marcato, all right.

1266
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,417
Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that...

1267
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,628
no wonder he switched his name around.

1268
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,172
You... You don't think
he's the same?

1269
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,466
What do you mean? A witch?

1270
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:38,719
Ro, are you kidding?
Oh, Ro, honey.

1271
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,264
His father was a martyr to it.

1272
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,476
- Do you know how he died?
- Honey, it's 1966.

1273
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,811
This was published in 1933.

1274
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:50,147
There were covens in Europe...
that's what they're called...

1275
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,316
the, uh... the congregation...

1276
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:56,820
covens in Europe, in America, and in
Australia, and they have one right here.

1277
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:59,907
That whole bunch... the parties with
the singing and the flute and the chanting...

1278
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:02,993
- those are esbats or sabbaths
or whatever they're called.
- Honey, don't get excited.

1279
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:06,664
Read what they do, Guy!
They use blood in their rituals...

1280
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,333
and the blood that has
the most power is baby's blood.

1281
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,669
And they don't just use the blood.
They use the flesh too.

1282
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,504
Rosemary, for God sakes!

1283
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,006
They're not setting foot
in this apartment ever again.

1284
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,050
And they're not coming
within 50 feet of the baby.

1285
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,844
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.

1286
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,430
Dr. Shand happens
to play the recorder.

1287
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,100
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

1288
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,269
- We're gonna sublet and move out.
- We are not.

1289
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:31,021
- Oh, yes, we are.
- We'll talk about it later.

1290
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,403
And I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1291
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,030
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today, honey.

1292
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,575
Look, your hands are shaking.
Now, come on. Give it to me.

1293
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,411
- You'll read it tomorrow.
- Guy...

1294
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,455
I mean it, now.
Give it to me.

1295
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,966
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1296
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:01,302
- What'd you say the name was? Machado?
- Marcato.

1297
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:04,346
Fantastic. I think he told me once
his father was a coffee importer.

1298
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,015
He told Guy he was a producer.

1299
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:09,059
I understand how disturbed you must be
to have him for a close neighbor.

1300
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,770
I don't want anything more
to do with him. Or Minnie.

1301
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:15,566
- I can't take the slightest chance
where the baby's safety is concerned.
- Absolutely.

1302
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,735
Any mother would feel the same way.

1303
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,154
Is there any chance at all that maybe...

1304
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,574
Minnie put something harmful
in those drinks or those little cakes?

1305
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,411
No, Rosemary.
I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.

1306
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,456
- I won't take anything else from her.
- You won't have to.

1307
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,917
I can give you some pills
that'll be adequate these last few weeks.

1308
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:37,254
In a way, this may be...

1309
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,923
the answer to Minnie and Roman's problem too.

1310
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,760
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1311
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,636
In fact, confidentially...

1312
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,930
he has no more than a month or two left.

1313
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:50,809
- I had no idea.
- He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

1314
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,271
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the baby's birth.

1315
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,607
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.

1316
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:59,985
He'd be extremely embarrassed
if he knew what you found out.

1317
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,113
Suppose we do this:
I'll tell them to leave on Sunday.

1318
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,324
I'll say I spoke to you, and you understand.

1319
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,911
- Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

1320
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,998
No matter where we are...

1321
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,709
our thoughts are gonna be with you
every minute, darlin'...

1322
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,711
till you're all happy and thin again...

1323
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,297
and your sweet little boy or girl's
layin' safe in your arms.

1324
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,299
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1325
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:24,510
Yeah, you make Guy send us
lots of pictures, hear?

1326
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,095
Yes, I will.

1327
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,931
I'm not going to wish you good luck,
because you won't need it.

1328
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:31,475
You're going to have a happy, happy life.

1329
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,936
Have a good trip, and come back safely.

1330
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,979
Mm, perhaps.
But I may stay on...

1331
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:39,733
in Dubrovnik or Pescara or maybe Majorca.

1332
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,735
We shall see. We shall see.

1333
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,404
- Come back.
- Bye, Minnie.

1334
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,239
- Yeah, good-bye.
- Good-bye, Roman.

1335
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:47,825
- Bye. Good-bye.
- Take care, now.

1336
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:51,870
Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building, please.

1337
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,126
Oh, boy.

1338
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,216
- Guy?
- Hmm?

1339
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,135
Where's my book?

1340
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,012
Oh, I, uh, put it in the garbage.

1341
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:14,685
- What?
- I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

1342
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,230
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1343
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,024
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- That's a terrible thing to do.

1344
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:23,193
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1345
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,245
Hey, watch out, lady!

1346
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,759
"In some cults it was believed...

1347
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:32,137
that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary...

1348
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,139
and spells could not be cast...

1349
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,142
without one of the victim's belongings."

1350
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,229
- Yeah?
- Is this Donald Baumgart?

1351
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:43,565
- That's right.
- This is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1352
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,192
- Oh.
- Guy Woodhouse's wife?

1353
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,402
- Oh, yes.
- I wanted to know...

1354
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:50,280
My God, you must be
a happy little lady these days, huh?

1355
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,950
Living in the Bram.
Rows of uniformed lackeys.

1356
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:55,327
I wanted to know how you are,
if there's been any improvement.

1357
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:58,664
Well, bless your heart.

1358
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,833
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
Well, I'm splendid.

1359
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,378
I've only broke six glasses today.

1360
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,423
Guy and I are both very unhappy...

1361
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:12,135
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1362
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,224
Well, what the hell, huh?

1363
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,810
That's the way it goes, right?

1364
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:24,064
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1365
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,650
Vi... Visit? No.

1366
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,237
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks, huh?

1367
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,240
- Yes, that's what I meant.
- Right, right.

1368
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,076
By the way, he has something of yours, you know.

1369
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:38,328
What do you mean?

1370
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:40,914
- Don't you... Don't you know?
- No.

1371
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,166
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1372
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,671
You... You don't mean
my tie, do you?

1373
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,923
- Yes.
- Oh. Well...

1374
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,843
Well, he's got mine, and I've got his.

1375
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:55,012
- He can have it back.
- I'm sor...

1376
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:59,182
It doesn't matter to me now what, uh...
color tie I'm wearing.

1377
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,685
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

1378
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:04,855
No, no, no, no.
It was... It was a trade.

1379
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:08,150
Or do you think he stole it?

1380
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,152
I have to hang up now.

1381
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,155
I just wanted to know
if there'd been any improvement.

1382
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,990
No. No, there isn't.

1383
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,534
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

1384
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,865
You aren't in labor, are you?

1385
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,618
No, but I have to see the doctor.
It's very important.

1386
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:03,330
Well, he has to leave at 5:00,
and there is Mrs. Byron.

1387
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:06,291
- I'm sure he'll see you. Just sit down.
- Thank you.

1388
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:30,399
How is it out there?

1389
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,735
- Oh, awful. Ninety-four.
- Uh!

1390
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,947
- See you next week.
Make an appointment.
- Yes, I will.

1391
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:45,455
- You're due any day now, aren't you?
- Tuesday.

1392
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:48,875
- You're smart to get it over with
before August.
- Yeah.

1393
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,505
Mrs. Byron.
He'll see you right after.

1394
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:55,590
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

1395
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:59,010
- July the 10th?
- Um, what time?

1396
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:01,138
- 4:00?
- Fine.
- All righty.

1397
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:03,098
- See you then.
- Thank you.

1398
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,267
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Good luck.

1399
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,185
Thank you.

1400
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,653
Mmm. That smells nice.
What is it?

1401
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,241
Oh, my...
It's called Detchema.

1402
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,034
Mm.
Well, it's a big improvement...

1403
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:25,704
on your regular, if you don't mind my saying.

1404
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:29,416
That wasn't a perfume. That was
a good-luck charm. I threw it away.

1405
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:33,003
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1406
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,970
- Dr. Sapirstein?
- He has the aftershave.

1407
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,682
But it isn't, is it?
I don't think he has a good-luck charm.

1408
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,727
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while, whatever it is...

1409
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:51,938
and when he does... oh, boy!

1410
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,899
Haven't you ever noticed?

1411
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,650
No.

1412
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:58,612
Maybe you thought it was
your own you were smelling.

1413
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:01,782
What is it, a chemical thing?

1414
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:04,367
Will you excuse me a moment, please?

1415
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:07,746
My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.

1416
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,040
I'll be back in a minute.

1417
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,382
- Dr. Hill's office.
- Dr. Hill, please.

1418
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,386
This is his answering service.
Would you like to leave a message?

1419
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,513
Ye... Uh, yes.

1420
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,891
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse.

1421
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,687
And, um, would you ask him
to call me back right away, please?

1422
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,814
Uh, my number is...

1423
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,776
475-2598.

1424
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,028
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1425
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,780
All right.

1426
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:36,334
Quickly please, Dr. Hill.
Call me.

1427
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:46,511
Oh... Oh, really?
Did... did he really say that?

1428
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,097
Oh, he didn't say that!

1429
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,641
What else was it that he said?

1430
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:53,643
Oh, that... that's wonderful.

1431
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,812
That's won...
That's mar... marvelous.

1432
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:57,772
- - Yes, Dr. Hill?

1433
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,275
Did I get the name right?
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

1434
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:03,361
- Yes.
- Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

1435
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,447
No. Uh, yes.

1436
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,741
I mean, well, I've seen him once.

1437
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:11,077
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

1438
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:14,164
It's important.
Tell him to call me, hmm?

1439
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,249
- All right.
- Thank you.

1440
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:26,551
All of them. All of them.

1441
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,678
All in it together.

1442
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:31,431
All of them...
All of Them Witches.

1443
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,476
Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny.

1444
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,978
I'll kill them before I let them touch you.

1445
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,026
- - Yes? Doctor...

1446
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:44,861
- Mrs. Woodhouse?
- Yes.

1447
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:47,364
Oh, thank you, thank you for calling me.

1448
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,367
- I thought you were in California.
- No.

1449
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:53,119
No, I've been to another doctor...

1450
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,622
and he isn't good, Dr. Hill.

1451
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,999
He's been lying to me and giving me...

1452
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,461
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1453
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:04,881
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28?

1454
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:07,550
- Well, I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs. Woodhouse...

1455
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,303
No, please, let me...
let me talk to you.

1456
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:13,223
Let me come and explain what's been going on.

1457
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:15,266
I can't stay too long here.

1458
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:17,852
They'll be coming looking for me.

1459
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:21,022
Dr. Hill?
Dr. Hill, there's a plot.

1460
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,858
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking...

1461
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:26,069
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped."

1462
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:28,238
But I haven't flipped, Dr. Hill.

1463
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,907
I swear by all the saints I haven't.

1464
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,576
There are plots against people, aren't there?

1465
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:35,620
Yes, I suppose there are.

1466
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:40,000
Well, there's one against me and my baby.

1467
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:42,752
Come to my office tomorrow
after 5:00, and we'll...

1468
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,296
Now. Right now.

1469
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:47,966
Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm not
at my office now. I'm home.

1470
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:51,011
- I've been up since yesterday morning...
- I beg you!

1471
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,513
I beg you.

1472
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,598
I can't stay here.

1473
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,144
- My office at 8:00.
- Yes. Thank you.

1474
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,104
- All right.
- Oh, wait. Dr. Hill?

1475
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,607
- Yes?
- My husband may call you and ask if...

1476
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:07,444
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1477
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,320
Thank you.

1478
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,856
Keep the change.

1479
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,651
Driver, please, could you wait and watch...

1480
01:46:48,819 --> 01:46:50,987
until I'm inside the door?

1481
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:10,006
He lied to you.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1482
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,884
The worst thing of all...
he's involved with them as well.

1483
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:16,012
He sleeps in pajamas now.
He never used to before.

1484
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,014
He's probably hiding a mark.

1485
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,558
You know, they give you marks when you join.

1486
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:23,853
All sorts of rituals.
They hold sabbaths there.

1487
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,022
You could hear them singing through the wall.

1488
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,900
Guy... my husband, Guy...
said it was Dr. Shand...

1489
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,653
one of these people, playing a recorder.

1490
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:35,698
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand
unless he was there with them?

1491
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,285
Uh, they're very clever people.

1492
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,704
They planned everything
right from the beginning.

1493
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,874
They probably made some sort of deal with Guy.

1494
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:47,418
They gave him success, and he promised them...

1495
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:50,171
our baby to use in their rituals.

1496
01:47:51,257 --> 01:47:55,385
I know this sounds crazy, but I've...
I've got books here.

1497
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,387
Look.

1498
01:47:57,513 --> 01:48:00,849
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart...

1499
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,851
and they put a spell on him.

1500
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:05,228
They cast a spell on him and made him blind...

1501
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,230
so that Guy could get his part.

1502
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,149
Look. Here.

1503
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:14,612
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him.

1504
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:16,865
A writer.
He wrote stories for boys.

1505
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,993
Anyway, he was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1506
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:22,662
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1507
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,664
And, uh, anyway...

1508
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:27,834
once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me.

1509
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,213
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1510
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,884
I was suffering so... You can't imagine
how much I was suffering.

1511
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,261
And they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

1512
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:41,514
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it...

1513
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,517
also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1514
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:47,770
Hutch came, and he immediately
saw something was wrong.

1515
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,190
He knew about witches, you see?

1516
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:54,402
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on, which he never did.

1517
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,613
They probably called him to come home...

1518
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,449
and steal one of Hutch's belongings,
which he did.

1519
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:02,535
Took his glove.
And they put a spell on him too.

1520
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,955
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

1521
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:10,835
Now, maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure:

1522
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,254
They have a coven, and they want my baby.

1523
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,968
It certainly seems that way.

1524
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,980
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1525
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:32,815
I don't believe in witchcraft...

1526
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,652
but there're plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

1527
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:38,112
The doctor's name is Shand, you say?

1528
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:41,157
No, Dr. Shand
is one of these people.

1529
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:43,576
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.

1530
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,079
Abraham Sapirstein?

1531
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:48,998
Yeah.

1532
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:52,877
- Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.

1533
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:54,921
To look at him, you'd never think he...

1534
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:58,049
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

1535
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:00,343
Would you like to go into Mount Sinai right now?

1536
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:02,220
This evening?

1537
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:05,848
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

1538
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,518
It's difficult. We'll try.

1539
01:50:08,686 --> 01:50:11,020
I want you to lie down and get some rest.

1540
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,605
Thanks.

1541
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,775
Anything they've got.
Even a broom closet would be fine.

1542
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,361
I hope we can do better than that.

1543
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:26,744
I'll see what I can do,
and then I'll check you over.

1544
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:32,041
Should I undress now?

1545
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:34,335
No, it'll take me about
a half an hour on the telephone.

1546
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,462
You just lie down. Rest.

1547
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:40,758
- Okay?
- Okay.

1548
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:51,227
God bless Dr. Hill.

1549
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:01,279
Everything's gonna be okay now, Andy or Jenny.

1550
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:04,449
We're gonna be in a nice, clean hospital...

1551
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,534
with no visitors.

1552
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,705
Oh.

1553
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:33,269
Monsters.

1554
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:41,694
Unspeakable!

1555
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:14,936
I was sleeping.

1556
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:31,327
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.

1557
01:52:31,453 --> 01:52:33,538
Don't argue or make a scene...

1558
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,998
because if you say anything more
about witches or witchcraft...

1559
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,876
we're gonna be forced
to take you to a mental hospital.

1560
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:42,171
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.

1561
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:45,508
We just want to take you home.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1562
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:48,136
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.

1563
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,865
She's fine now.

1564
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:12,076
- We're going to go home and rest.
- That's all it takes.

1565
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:15,496
- Thank you for your trouble, Doctor.
- I'm glad I could be of help, sir.

1566
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:17,540
It's a shame you had to come in here.

1567
01:54:10,636 --> 01:54:12,970
Good evening, Mrs. Woodhouse.

1568
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:32,657
Mrs. Woodhouse!

1569
01:55:36,847 --> 01:55:39,473
Ro! Ro!

1570
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,351
Ro! Oh, Ro, baby.

1571
01:55:42,519 --> 01:55:44,729
Ro! Ro!

1572
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,359
- Come on. Open up, Ro.
- Go to hell!

1573
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:54,488
- Come on, honey.
No one's gonna hurt you.
- You promised them the baby! Get out!

1574
01:55:54,615 --> 01:55:56,574
I didn't promise them anything.
What are you talking about? Promised who?

1575
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:59,619
- Rosemary...
- You too! Get away!

1576
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,027
- Hello?
- Elise?

1577
01:56:33,153 --> 01:56:35,071
- Mrs. Dunstan is out.
- Who's this?

1578
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:37,239
- The babysitter.
- Do you know where she went?

1579
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:39,992
- They went to the movies.
- This is Rosemary.

1580
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:42,828
Please ask her to call Rosemary
the second she gets home.

1581
01:56:42,954 --> 01:56:45,331
It's terribly urgent.

1582
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:48,042
- Don't forget, hmm?
- Don't worry. I'll tell her.

1583
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:49,919
Thank you.

1584
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:59,011
We don't want
to hurt you, Ro. Uh...

1585
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:01,013
We're your friends, Rosemary.

1586
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,475
There's nothing to be afraid of, Rosemary.
Honest and truly there isn't.

1587
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:07,561
This is nothing but a mild sedative
to calm you down.

1588
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:09,397
You know I wouldn't let anyone...

1589
01:57:09,523 --> 01:57:11,816
Ro! Ro!

1590
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:15,027
- Ro! Ro!
- Help me!

1591
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:17,780
- Oh, Ro, baby. Stop.
- Somebody help me!

1592
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:19,407
Ro!

1593
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:33,295
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, now.

1594
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:41,554
- We happen to be in labor here.
- Here?

1595
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,681
- Here.
- You're gonna be all right, baby.

1596
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:46,183
You're gonna be perfectly all right.
I swear to God.

1597
01:57:46,309 --> 01:57:49,645
- It was supposed to be Doctors Hospital!
- Don't go on like this, Ro, please.

1598
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:52,189
- Doctors Hospital, with nurses...
- It'll be perfectly all right.

1599
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:54,483
- And everything clean and sterile!
- I give you my word of honor!

1600
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:58,320
Hello? No, she isn't here, Elise.
I'll have her call you back.

1601
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,205
Oh, Andy... Andy or Jenny...

1602
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:12,918
I'm sorry, my little darling.

1603
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:15,004
Forgive me!

1604
01:58:26,183 --> 01:58:27,783
Hi.

1605
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:38,736
Is it all right?

1606
01:58:38,862 --> 01:58:41,280
Yes.

1607
01:58:41,406 --> 01:58:43,073
It's fine.

1608
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:45,993
What is it?

1609
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:48,996
A boy.

1610
01:58:52,834 --> 01:58:55,085
Really? A boy?

1611
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:07,264
And it's all right?

1612
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,016
Yes.

1613
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:31,372
Where is it?

1614
01:59:31,498 --> 01:59:33,290
Oh, my goodness!

1615
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:35,876
Oh, dear, what a start you gave me!
My goodness!

1616
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,962
The baby... where is it?

1617
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:41,048
Oh, uh, you-you wait here
one minute.

1618
01:59:43,385 --> 01:59:45,469
Where's my baby?

1619
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:49,014
I'll go find Dr. Abe.
Ju... Just wait.

1620
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:07,950
Where's the baby?

1621
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,745
Where is it?

1622
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:14,039
Honey...

1623
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:18,043
There were complications, Rosemary,
but nothing that will affect future births.

1624
02:00:21,548 --> 02:00:23,132
It's...

1625
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:27,261
Dead.
It was in the wrong position.

1626
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:30,055
In a hospital, I might've been able
to do something, but you wouldn't listen.

1627
02:00:30,181 --> 02:00:32,975
Honey, we can have others
as soon as you're better. I promise.

1628
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,395
Absolutely. You can
start on another in a very few months.

1629
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:38,856
- As soon as you're better.
- You lie.

1630
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:41,942
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

1631
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:44,570
- Honey. Honey...
- You're lying! It didn't die!

1632
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:47,406
You took it! You're lying!

1633
02:00:47,532 --> 02:00:49,992
You witches, you're lying!

1634
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:53,245
You're lying! You're lying!

1635
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:55,289
You're lying!

1636
02:01:03,965 --> 02:01:07,343
Abe says it's called... prepartum.

1637
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:11,138
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

1638
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:14,600
Boy, you were really - kapow!...
out of your mind.

1639
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:20,105
Uh... Yeah, I know where
you got the idea...

1640
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:23,525
that Minnie and Roman were witches...

1641
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:27,196
But how come you thought
Abe and I joined the party?

1642
02:01:30,617 --> 02:01:32,743
Um...

1643
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:34,745
Let's face it, darling.
You had the...

1644
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:37,456
prepartum crazies.

1645
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:41,794
And now you're gonna rest,
and you're gonna get over them.

1646
02:01:43,296 --> 02:01:46,382
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you...

1647
02:01:46,508 --> 02:01:48,801
but from now on, everything's gonna be roses.

1648
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:51,136
Paramount's within an inch
of where we want 'em...

1649
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:53,472
and suddenly Universal's interested too.

1650
02:01:53,598 --> 02:01:56,934
And we're gonna blow this town, and we're
gonna be in the beautiful hills of Beverly...

1651
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:00,521
with a pool and a spice garden...
the whole schmear.

1652
02:02:00,647 --> 02:02:03,190
And the kids too, Ro.
Scout's honor.

1653
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:05,401
You heard what Abe said.

1654
02:02:08,989 --> 02:02:11,865
Well, I got to run now and get famous.

1655
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:16,912
Let me see your shoulder.

1656
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:23,419
- Let me see your shoulder.
- Are you kidding?

1657
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,338
Your left shoulder.

1658
02:02:26,464 --> 02:02:28,507
All right. Anything you say.

1659
02:02:31,553 --> 02:02:34,179
I generally prefer doing this to music.

1660
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:36,432
Left shoulder.

1661
02:02:39,227 --> 02:02:41,145
Right shoulder.

1662
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:46,191
And that's as far as I go without a blue light.

1663
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:53,782
The high-pressure area
that we see here...

1664
02:02:53,908 --> 02:02:56,910
has been causing this extreme heat and humidity...

1665
02:02:57,037 --> 02:02:59,538
And unfortunately will be staying
with us city dwellers...

1666
02:02:59,664 --> 02:03:01,373
through the rest of the week.

1667
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:04,835
It will be hot and overcast
Upstate New York as well...

1668
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:08,005
with the possibility of thunder showers
tonight and tomorrow...

1669
02:03:08,173 --> 02:03:11,008
- - With gradual clearing by tomorrow night.

1670
02:03:11,134 --> 02:03:14,720
All you people leaving the city
this upcoming weekend should find it hot...

1671
02:03:14,846 --> 02:03:16,847
- -

1672
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:41,955
Do you hear a baby crying?

1673
02:03:42,082 --> 02:03:44,416
Why, no, I don't, dear.

1674
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:46,710
Now, you come and get into your bed now.

1675
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:49,379
It's time for you to take your pill.

1676
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:01,558
- Did you turn the air conditioner off?
- Mm-hmm.

1677
02:04:01,726 --> 02:04:03,852
You mustn't do that, dear.

1678
02:04:03,978 --> 02:04:06,772
Why, people are actually dying, it's so hot.

1679
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:24,206
What do you do with the milk?

1680
02:04:24,332 --> 02:04:26,333
Why, uh, throw it away.

1681
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,293
Oh. Your pill, Rosemary.

1682
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:40,764
Hello, girls. Whew!

1683
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:42,432
Ninety-five out.

1684
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:45,352
Some new people moved on in up on eight.

1685
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:48,313
Do they have a baby?

1686
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,525
How'd you know that?

1687
02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:55,154
I heard it crying.

1688
02:04:56,281 --> 02:04:58,198
Oh, wait a minute.

1689
02:05:01,286 --> 02:05:05,247
- Oh! No. Don't do that.
- Why not?

1690
02:05:05,373 --> 02:05:09,084
Uh... a little messy, that's all.

1691
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,923
Easy, easy.

1692
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:20,817
"You've got her too high."

1693
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:43,507
Not if he's still waiting for a plane, he isn't!

1694
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:46,385
- - Shh. Quiet, please.

1695
02:08:46,511 --> 02:08:49,429
Ah, hell, now, Hayato,
you're just making fun of me.

1696
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,099
You're pullin' my leg, like we say over here.

1697
02:09:21,712 --> 02:09:23,880
Rosemary, go back to bed.

1698
02:09:24,048 --> 02:09:26,174
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.

1699
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:28,427
- Is the mother?
- Uh, Rosemary...

1700
02:09:28,553 --> 02:09:29,803
- Shut up!
- Rosemary...

1701
02:09:29,929 --> 02:09:32,431
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

1702
02:10:16,767 --> 02:10:19,311
What have you done to it?

1703
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:21,813
What have you done to its eyes?

1704
02:10:21,939 --> 02:10:23,982
He has his father's eyes.

1705
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:32,240
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal!

1706
02:10:32,366 --> 02:10:35,619
What have you done to him, you maniacs?

1707
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,622
Satan is his father, not Guy.

1708
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:42,125
He came up from hell
and begat a son of mortal woman.

1709
02:10:42,251 --> 02:10:44,085
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!

1710
02:10:44,212 --> 02:10:48,048
Satan is his father, and his name is Adrian.

1711
02:10:48,174 --> 02:10:51,426
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

1712
02:10:51,552 --> 02:10:53,470
He shall redeem the despised...

1713
02:10:53,638 --> 02:10:55,305
and wreak vengeance...

1714
02:10:55,473 --> 02:10:57,974
in the name of the burned and the tortured!

1715
02:10:58,142 --> 02:11:00,018
- Hail, Adrian!
- Hail, Adrian!

1716
02:11:00,144 --> 02:11:02,604
- No! No!
- Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!

1717
02:11:02,730 --> 02:11:05,857
- Hail, Satan!
- He chose you out of all the world.

1718
02:11:05,983 --> 02:11:08,443
Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

1719
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:12,155
He arranged things 'cause he wanted you
to be the mother of his only livin' son.

1720
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:14,658
- His power is stronger than stronger.
- Hail, Satan!

1721
02:11:14,825 --> 02:11:18,203
- His might shall last longer than longer.
- Hail, Satan!

1722
02:11:19,497 --> 02:11:21,498
No!

1723
02:11:21,624 --> 02:11:23,625
It can't be!

1724
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:27,087
- No!
- Go look at his hands.

1725
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:28,505
And his feet.

1726
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:32,968
Oh, God!

1727
02:11:34,053 --> 02:11:36,304
- God is dead!
- Hail, Satan!

1728
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:39,641
Satan lives!
The year is One!

1729
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:43,770
- Hail, Satan!
- The year is One and God is done!
- Oh, God!

1730
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:46,856
- The year is One!
- Hail, Adrian!

1731
02:11:50,778 --> 02:11:53,697
Why don't you help us out, Rosemary?

1732
02:11:53,823 --> 02:11:57,701
Be a real mother to Adrian.
You don't have to join if you don't want to.

1733
02:11:57,868 --> 02:11:59,869
Just be a mother to your baby.

1734
02:12:01,622 --> 02:12:05,125
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.

1735
02:12:05,251 --> 02:12:08,545
It's not right.

1736
02:12:08,713 --> 02:12:10,630
Think about it, Rosemary.

1737
02:12:24,145 --> 02:12:25,812
Oh, God!

1738
02:12:25,938 --> 02:12:28,815
Oh, shut up with your "Oh, Gods,"
or we'll kill ya, milk or no milk!

1739
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:30,942
You shut up.
Rosemary's his mother...

1740
02:12:31,068 --> 02:12:32,819
so you show some respect.

1741
02:12:35,615 --> 02:12:37,991
Come, my friend.
Come see him.

1742
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:39,784
Come see the child.

1743
02:12:50,212 --> 02:12:53,089
- What would you like to drink?
- I should like a Coca-Cola.

1744
02:12:53,215 --> 02:12:55,884
They, uh, promised me you wouldn't be hurt...

1745
02:12:56,010 --> 02:12:59,220
and you haven't been, really.

1746
02:12:59,347 --> 02:13:02,432
I mean, supposing
you had the baby and you lost it?

1747
02:13:03,517 --> 02:13:05,560
Wouldn't that be the same?

1748
02:13:05,686 --> 02:13:08,438
And we're getting so much in return, Ro.

1749
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:23,244
Oh, Guy, let me introduce you
to Argyron Stavropoulos.

1750
02:13:23,371 --> 02:13:27,332
How proud you must be!
Is this the mother?

1751
02:13:27,458 --> 02:13:31,002
- Why in the name...
- Here, drink this. You'll feel a little better.

1752
02:13:31,128 --> 02:13:32,921
What's in it? Tannis root?

1753
02:13:33,047 --> 02:13:36,800
Nothin's in it. Just plain, ordinary
Lipton's tea. You drink it.

1754
02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:10,959
Get away from here! Roman!

1755
02:14:11,085 --> 02:14:13,169
You're rocking him too fast.

1756
02:14:13,337 --> 02:14:16,256
Sit down! Get her out of here.
Put her where she belongs.

1757
02:14:16,382 --> 02:14:19,050
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.

1758
02:14:19,176 --> 02:14:22,178
- Mind your own business!
- Let Rosemary rock him.

1759
02:14:22,304 --> 02:14:24,681
Go on. Sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.

1760
02:14:24,849 --> 02:14:27,767
- Why, she's liable to...
- Sit down with the others, Laura-Louise.

1761
02:14:38,362 --> 02:14:40,071
Rock him.

1762
02:14:42,366 --> 02:14:44,701
You're trying to get me to be his mother.

1763
02:14:46,036 --> 02:14:48,204
Aren't you his mother?

1764
02:16:46,824 --> 02:16:48,783
[Ends]
