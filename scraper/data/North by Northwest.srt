00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,556
Even if you accept the belief that the
high Trendex means a rising sales curve...

2
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,015
- Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night.

3
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,643
- Say hello to the missus.
- We're not talking.

4
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,520
My recommendation is still the same.

5
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,731
Spread the good word
in as many small-time segments as we can.

6
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,861
Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

7
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,196
Why don't we colonize
at the Colony next week?

8
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,991
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.

9
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,617
You better walk me to the Plaza.

10
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,704
- I didn't put a coat on.
- Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

11
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,622
- Next?
- Gretchen Sabinson.

12
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,126
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy
from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.

13
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,628
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.

14
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,255
She'll think she's eating money.

15
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,091
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours..."

16
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,135
- You sent that one last time.
- I did?

17
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,347
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts."

18
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,600
- I know.
- Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?

19
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,810
- For two blocks?
- You're late and I'm tired.

20
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,521
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

21
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,148
Here. Taxi.

22
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,276
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

23
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,903
- Well, no.
- Thank you very much.

24
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,112
Perfectly all right.

25
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,158
- First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
- Poor man.

26
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,410
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.

27
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,789
- I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
- He knew you were lying.

28
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,126
Ah, in the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

29
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,255
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.

30
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,258
- Say, do I look heavyish to you?
- What?

31
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,843
I feel heavyish.

32
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,512
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,473
"Think thin."

34
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,559
- Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
- Okay.

35
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,437
Oh. Soon as you get back,
call my mother.

36
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,148
Remind her we've got those theater tickets
for tonight.

37
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,067
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

38
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,154
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar,
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

39
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,157
- She doesn't do that.
- Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

40
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,827
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first tomorrow,
the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...

41
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,996
...then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

42
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,457
- Oh, yeah. Where was that?
- Larry and Arnold's, 1:00.

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,584
- Oh.
- Will you check in later?

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,794
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,714
Here, driver, take this lady
back where she belongs.

46
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,883
- Right.
- That ought to cover it.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,136
- Don't forget, call my mother right away.
- I won't.

48
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,181
- Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night, sweetie.

49
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,020
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs...

50
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,377
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,963
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,881
Yes, sir. Right this way.

53
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,175
- Herman.
- Roger.

54
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,011
- I'm a little late.
- Roger Thornhill.

55
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,637
- Fanning Nelson.
- How do you do?

56
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,347
- How do you do?
- Larry Wade.

57
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,559
- We got a little head start here.
- Oh, that won't last long.

58
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,230
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be
slow on starting but there's nobody faster.

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,817
- What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
- I just did something stupid.

60
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,571
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

61
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,699
- Why not?
- She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

62
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,285
- Your secretary?
- No. My mother.

63
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,496
One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.

64
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,915
- George Kaplan.
- Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

65
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,709
- Mr. George Kaplan?
- Boy.

66
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,301
- Kaplan.
- I've got to get off a wire immediately.

67
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,762
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

68
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,431
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me.

69
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,434
- Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
- Go right ahead.

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,814
- Right through there, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

71
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,649
Thank you, sir.

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,111
Wait, what's that supposed to be?

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,740
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.

74
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,076
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

75
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,287
Let's go where? Who...? Who are you?

76
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,539
Mere errand boys
carrying concealed weapons.

77
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,668
His is pointed at your heart. So, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

78
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,629
What is this, a joke or something?

79
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,132
- Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
- Come.

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,801
But this is ridiculous.

81
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,950
Don't tell me where we're going,
surprise me.

82
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,496
You know, I left some friends back there
in the Oak Bar.

83
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,540
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.

84
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,501
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

85
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,922
...so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?

86
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,675
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

87
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,394
Locked.

88
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,033
Who's Townsend?

89
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,328
Really?

90
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,205
Interesting.

91
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,168
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, dressing.

92
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,754
- Tell him I'm here.
- The dinner guests are expected.

93
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,964
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."

94
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,383
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

95
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,135
- Is anyone in the library?
- No.

96
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,762
This way.

97
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,107
You will wait here.

98
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,194
Well, don't hurry.
I'll catch up on my reading.

99
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,946
Good evening.

100
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,556
Not what I expected. A little taller.

101
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,350
A little more polished than the others.

102
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,187
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.

103
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,691
But I'm afraid just as obvious.

104
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,153
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

105
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,866
Games? Must we?

106
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,869
Not that I mind a case of abduction...

107
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,663
...but I have tickets
for the theater this evening.

108
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:28,376
To a show I was looking forward to. And I
get unreasonable about things like that.

109
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,505
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

110
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,135
Oh, Leonard,
have you met our distinguished guest?

111
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,513
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

112
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,559
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

113
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,813
- Elusiveness, however misguided...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

114
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,941
- Did you call me "Kaplan"?
- I know you're a man of many names...

115
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,819
...but I'm perfectly willing to accept
your current choice.

116
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,154
Current choice?

117
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,616
My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

118
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,326
Of course.

119
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,705
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

120
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,749
Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

121
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,336
I told you, I'm not Kaplan,
whoever he is. I'm...

122
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,046
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

123
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,422
The guests are here, dear.

124
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,759
Look after them. I'll be
with you in a few minutes.

125
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,596
Now, shall we get down to business?

126
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,931
I'm all for that.

127
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,434
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

128
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,728
...and how you've come by
this information.

129
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,439
- I don't expect to get this for nothing.
- Of course not.

130
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,068
Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you
to fall in with this suggestion...

131
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,739
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

132
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,911
What the devil is that supposed to mean?

133
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,706
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

134
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,709
- I've already told you...
- We know where you're headed for.

135
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,960
I know where I'm headed.

136
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,464
I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.

137
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,100
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

138
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,312
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

139
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,482
- I'm not Kaplan.
- I do wish you'd reconsider.

140
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,237
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

141
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,657
What contact?
I've never even been in Pittsburgh.

142
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,661
On June the 16th, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

143
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,789
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

144
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,834
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

145
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,753
...as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

146
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,338
On August 11th,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

147
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,176
August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

148
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,511
At present, you are registered
in room 796...

149
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,765
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

150
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,016
- Really?
- In two days...

151
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,436
...you are due at the Ambassador East
in Chicago.

152
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,273
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

153
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,358
- Not me.
- There's very little sense...

154
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,362
...in maintaining that you're deceiving us
any more than we're deceiving you.

155
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,532
I don't suppose it would do any good
to show you ID cards...

156
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,787
- ...a driver's license, things like that?
- They provide you with such good ones.

157
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,332
It's getting late. I have guests.

158
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,919
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

159
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,295
A simple no.

160
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,382
For the simple reason I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

161
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,430
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

162
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,307
A pleasant journey, sir.

163
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:46,991
- Scotch? Rye? Bourbon? Vodka?
- Nothing. I'll take a quick ride back to town.

164
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,910
Oh, that has been arranged.

165
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,413
But first, a libation.

166
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,665
Bourbon.

167
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,168
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

168
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:02,507
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, it'll be necessary for us to insist.

169
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,605
Cheers.

170
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,072
Don't worry about me, fellas.
I'll take the bus.

171
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,329
Thanks for the lift, fellas.

172
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,207
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

173
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

174
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,587
You see, they tried to kill me.
He won't listen to me.

175
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,923
In a big house, they tried to kill me.

176
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,218
- All right, let's just go inside.
- I don't wanna go inside.

177
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,263
- Somebody call the police.
- Come on. Come on now.

178
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,890
Okay.

179
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,399
Sit down.

180
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,693
I don't wanna sit.

181
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,154
Perfectly all right. See?

182
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,367
We'll get them. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

183
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,037
Assault with a gun, and a bourbon,
and a sports car. We'll get them.

184
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,958
You'll be all right after a good night's
sleep. We got a nice cell all made up.

185
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,838
- I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
- The car was just reported stolen.

186
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,341
- Uh-huh.
- A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

187
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,679
- I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
- You're allowed one call.

188
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,431
- Over here.
- Oh, thanks.

189
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,976
You better make it your lawyer.

190
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,728
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

191
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,897
What am I, a telephone operator?

192
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,608
Butterfield 8-1 -0-9-8.

193
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,582
Just a minute, please. Here.

194
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,791
Thank you.

195
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,920
Hello, Mother?

196
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,841
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

197
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,217
Yeah.

198
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,428
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

199
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,807
- Where am I?
- Glen Cove Police Station.

200
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,144
Glen Cove Police Station.

201
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,606
No. No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

202
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:57,320
No. No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

203
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,364
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

204
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,574
No.

205
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,367
Come on, let's go.

206
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,955
- Wait, I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are. Come on.

207
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,167
Mother, I gotta go now.

208
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,878
Get my lawyer right away,
and come out and bail me out.

209
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,130
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

210
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,633
Tomorrow morning, he says.

211
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,470
I don't know. I'll ask him.
She wants to know who says.

212
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,639
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

213
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,682
Sergeant Emile...

214
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,476
Emile?

215
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,313
Sergeant Emile Klinger.

216
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,066
No, I didn't believe it either.

217
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,154
Uh, I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
Good night, dear.

218
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,160
That was Mother.

219
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,287
Let's go.

220
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,545
Here's your man, doctor.

221
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,301
- What's your name?
- Roger Thornhill.

222
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,387
Stick out your tongue and say "ah."

223
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,013
You better move back.

224
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,974
Ah...

225
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,600
Have you been drinking?

226
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,270
Doctor, I am gassed.

227
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,688
What were you drinking?

228
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,065
Well, bourbon.
See, these two fellas, they...

229
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,818
- How much would you say you drank?
- What did you say?

230
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,530
- How much would you say that you drank?
- About this much.

231
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,200
Mr. Thornhill, it is my opinion
that you are definitely intoxicated.

232
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,410
No question about it.

233
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,870
I am now gonna ask your permission
to draw blood.

234
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,038
How disgusting.

235
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,624
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made..."

236
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,918
"...but if you do,
your license will be revoked."

237
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,379
"You have the right
to notify a physician of..."

238
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,549
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

239
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,052
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

240
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,223
...he naturally had to drive as best
he could under the, uh, circumstances.

241
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,059
Counselor,
how long have you known your client?

242
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,352
Seven years, Your Honor.

243
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,813
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?

244
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,149
- Absolutely.
- Ha.

245
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,735
- Mother.
- And do you believe...

246
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,696
...there is some credence to this story?

247
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,406
- Credence?
- Well, yes, Your Honor.

248
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,950
I mean, if my client says
this is what happened...

249
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,703
- ...I'm certain it must've happened.
- You're damn right.

250
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,374
Sergeant, I want this turned over
to the county detectives for investigation.

251
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,918
Call them up
and have them come here immediately.

252
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,754
- Right, Your Honor.
- Counselor...

253
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,423
...I'm going to set this over for final
disposition...

254
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,342
...tomorrow night at 7:30.

255
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,095
At which time I expect you and the
defendant to be here, ready to go to trial.

256
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,433
In the meantime, the county detectives will
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

257
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,771
"Basis in fact"? If I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe...

258
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,064
Roger, wait a minute.

259
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,025
I mean, after all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

260
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,780
That is precisely what
we're intending to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

261
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,424
- Yes?
- Remember me?

262
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,842
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

263
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,388
- Is Mr. Townsend at home?
- No, I'm sorry he's left for the day, sir.

264
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,431
Mrs. Townsend?

265
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,476
- Who shall I say is calling?
- County detectives.

266
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,395
Come in, please.

267
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,281
This way, please.

268
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,418
This is the room.

269
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,586
- I'll call madam.
- You do that.

270
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,797
And here's the sofa
where they held me down.

271
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,259
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

272
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,305
Well, they must've cleaned them off.

273
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,766
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

274
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,227
Scotch, gin, vodka...

275
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,355
And bourbon.

276
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,152
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

277
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,659
Roger, dear,
we were so worried about you.

278
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,288
Did you get home all right?
Of course you did.

279
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,666
Let me look at you.
Oh, a little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

280
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,544
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

281
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,797
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

282
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,801
I'm Captain Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

283
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,721
- This is Lieutenant Harding.
- How do you do?

284
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,307
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

285
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,893
- Stop calling me Roger.
- Has he gotten into trouble?

286
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,481
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

287
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,150
- ...and incidentally, in a stolen car.
- Stolen car?

288
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,736
Belonging to Mrs. Babson of Twining Road.

289
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,280
Roger, you said
you were going to call a cab.

290
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:56,494
- You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
- No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes.

291
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,998
Mr. Thornhill told us that he was brought to
this house against his will last night...

292
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,251
...and, uh, forcibly intoxicated
by some friends of your husband...

293
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,836
...and set out on the road.

294
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,589
- Do you know anything about this?
- Well, now, captain...

295
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,675
...Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

296
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,885
She's lying.

297
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,929
And I'm afraid he became even worse...

298
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,263
...as the evening wore on.

299
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,558
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

300
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,186
Oh, I knew
I should've served dinner earlier.

301
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,896
What a performance.

302
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,525
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

303
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,901
George Kaplan?

304
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,737
- No.
- I didn't think so.

305
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,366
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

306
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,286
- Is there any place he can be reached?
- Why, yes. The United Nations.

307
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,247
United Nat...?

308
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,458
He's addressing the General
Assembly this afternoon.

309
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,504
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

310
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,966
- Sorry we had to bother you.
- No bother at all.

311
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,470
Now, wait a minute.

312
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,979
Will you be wanting to get
in touch with my husband?

313
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,356
No, Mrs. Townsend, that won't be necessary.

314
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,817
You mean you're not gonna
do any more about this?

315
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:14,071
Roger. Pay the two dollars.

316
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,170
Goodbye.

317
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,076
- I don't see why you want me along.
- You lend a certain air of respectability.

318
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,162
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

319
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,051
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

320
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,386
Well, here goes. Ahem.

321
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:24,183
Hello, Operator. Have you got
a George Kaplan staying here?

322
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,727
That's right.

323
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,936
You have?

324
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,272
Room 796?

325
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,191
Ring it, will you please?

326
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,400
You see?

327
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,694
I see. I hope he clears up
this silly business.

328
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,614
- You're ruining my whole day.
- Shh, shh. All right. Quiet. Shut up.

329
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,993
Oh. Well, did he leave word
when he'd be back?

330
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,120
Really?

331
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,122
Thank you.

332
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,376
Well, that's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

333
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,378
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

334
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,588
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

335
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,717
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

336
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,095
Don't be ridiculous.
I wouldn't do such a thing.

337
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,514
- Ten dollars?
- Not for all the money in the world.

338
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,809
- Fifty?
- Roger, you are disgraceful.

339
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:15,067
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge.

340
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,610
And now, housebreaking.

341
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,904
You're hotel-breaking.
There's a difference.

342
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,573
- Of five to ten years.
- Just a minute, please.

343
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,662
Will you want me
to be changing your bedding, sir?

344
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,706
Yes. Well, but not right now.

345
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,042
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

346
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,690
...and I was wondering
if I ought to go on changing the linens.

347
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,549
- Oh. Thank you for your interest.
- You're welcome, sir.

348
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,758
Come on, now.

349
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,348
Now, she seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

350
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,268
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

351
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,613
- Oh, well, look who's here.
- Who? Where?

352
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,576
Our friend who's assembling the
General Assembly this afternoon.

353
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,494
Roger, I think we should go.

354
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,496
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

355
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:13,292
- I'll be late for the bridge club.
- Good. You will lose less than usual.

356
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,848
Ooh.

357
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,518
- Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
- In that case, I think we should leave.

358
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,480
Too late.

359
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,946
- You rang for me, sir?
- Yes. Come in a moment.

360
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,825
- What's your name?
- Elsie, sir.

361
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,371
- Elsie, do you know who I am?
- You're... You're Mr. Kaplan.

362
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,708
Well, when did...?
When did you first see me?

363
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,959
Outside the door.

364
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,630
Out in the hall, a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

365
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,882
And that's the first time
you laid eyes on me?

366
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,384
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

367
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,553
Well, then, how do you know
I am Mr. Kaplan?

368
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,722
- What?
- How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

369
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,309
Well, of course you are.
This is room 796, isn't it?

370
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,271
So you're the gentleman in room 796,
aren't you?

371
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,689
All right, Elsie, thanks.

372
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,400
- Will that be all, sir?
- For the time being, yes.

373
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,574
Valet.

374
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,493
Oh, yes, come in.

375
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,037
Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?

376
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,747
Yes, please.

377
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,963
Tell me, uh...

378
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,757
I forgot,
what time did I give you that suit?

379
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,009
Last night, around, uh...

380
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,427
- Around 6.
- Oh.

381
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,097
- Did I give it to you personally?
- Personally?

382
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,475
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me...

383
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:57,354
...and said it would be hanging
in your closet. Like you always do.

384
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,232
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, just curious.

385
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,442
- Here. Thanks.
- Thank you.

386
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,403
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

387
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,784
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

388
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,329
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

389
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,249
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

390
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,792
Oh...

391
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,424
Let me see something.

392
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,308
I don't think that one does anything
for you.

393
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,981
Ah, now, that's much better.

394
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,597
Now, obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

395
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,491
- Should I?
- Certainly not.

396
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,703
Here, hold that, dear.

397
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,999
Hello.

398
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,793
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

399
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,128
Who is this?

400
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,423
We met only last night, and still
you do not recognize my voice.

401
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,508
I should feel offended.

402
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,887
Yes, I know who you are,
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

403
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,849
Of course not. You answer his telephone,
you live in his hotel room...

404
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,018
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

405
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,688
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

406
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,315
Now, wait...

407
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,485
- Hello, Operator? Operator.
- Yes?

408
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,197
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn...
Kaplan in 796.

409
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,700
That call. Was that an outside call
or did it come from the lobby?

410
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,328
- Just a minute, sir. I'll see.
- Well, hurry, please.

411
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,537
Who was it?

412
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,831
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

413
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,334
- We're back to that one, are we?
- Hello? Operator?

414
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,710
- Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

415
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,963
That call was made from the lobby, sir.

416
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,506
It was?

417
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,716
They're probably
on their way up here now.

418
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,595
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I think I'd like to meet these killers.

419
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,934
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

420
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,460
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

421
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,714
Oh, no, gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

422
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,799
That's right. Come along. Good.

423
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,136
Roger. Roger, will you be home
for dinner?

424
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,226
- Where to?
- I don't know. Just keep going.

425
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,952
- Take me to the United Nations.
- Right.

426
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,829
General Assembly Building.

427
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,874
- Right.
- I'm being followed. Can you do anything?

428
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,667
- Yes, I can.
- Do it.

429
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,619
- May I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.

430
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,249
- Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
- Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

431
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,210
- Yes.
- And did you have an appointment, sir?

432
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,170
Well, yes, yes. He expects me.

433
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,797
Your name, please.

434
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,091
- My name?
- Yes, please.

435
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,552
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

436
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,222
One moment, please.

437
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,063
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

438
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,366
If you'll give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

439
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,703
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

440
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,093
Mr. Bernardi of the Swiss Observers Office.

441
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,930
Mr. Bernardi
of the Swiss Observers Office.

442
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,894
Will you page
Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

443
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,979
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

444
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,733
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

445
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,862
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

446
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,947
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

447
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,367
Please call at the communications desk
of the public lounge.

448
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,370
Miss Knox of salon...

449
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,788
You paged me?

450
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,290
- Mr. Kaplan?
- Yes.

451
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,250
- You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
- Yes.

452
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,879
- This is Mr. Townsend.
- How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

453
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,966
- This isn't Mr. Townsend.
- Yes, it is.

454
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,636
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

455
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,888
That's me. What can I do for you?

456
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,433
Mr. Mauney, Delegation of Pakistan.
Please call the public lounge.

457
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,311
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

458
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,481
That's right. Are we neighbors?

459
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,567
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

460
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,611
That's the one.

461
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,113
Were you at home last night,
Mr. Townsend?

462
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,782
- You mean in Glen Cove?
- Yes.

463
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,743
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

464
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,079
I always do when we're in session here.

465
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,914
What about Mrs. Townsend?

466
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,166
My wife has been dead for many years.

467
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,127
- Oh, I...
- Now, Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

468
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,755
Forgive me. Who are those people living
in your house?

469
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,466
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

470
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,678
Just the gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

471
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,931
Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me
who you are and what you want.

472
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,517
Well, please, just...

473
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,979
Look. Do you know this man?

474
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,030
Look!

475
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,619
He's got a knife. Look out!

476
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,580
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

477
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,208
- Call the police.
- Wait a minute. Don't come nearer.

478
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,043
Get back.

479
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,898
"The photograph has been identified
as that of Roger Thornhill..."

480
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,820
"...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name of George Kaplan..."

481
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,950
"...which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false."

482
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:53,246
"A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery..."

483
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,958
"...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
at Glen Cove police court..."

484
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:01,129
"...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car."

485
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,591
"In his defense, he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend..."

486
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,427
"...had tried to kill
him the night before."

487
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,805
- Brother.
- What about that?

488
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,850
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

489
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,770
- No, not me.
- Never heard of him.

490
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,021
Professor?

491
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,067
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

492
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,487
How can he get mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

493
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,782
Don't ask me how it happened.
Obviously, it happened.

494
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,869
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

495
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,746
...using Lester Townsend's house.

496
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:39,459
The unsuspecting Mr. Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

497
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,963
So horribly sad.
How is it I feel like laughing?

498
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,673
What are we going to do?

499
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,966
Do?

500
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,301
About Mr. Thornhill.

501
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,012
We, uh...

502
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,263
We do nothing.

503
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,101
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.

504
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:01,147
Or we could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

505
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,652
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

506
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,823
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

507
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,536
Yes, professor.
And how long do you think he'll stay live?

508
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,454
Well, that's his problem.

509
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,666
- What Mrs. Finley means, is...
- Oh, I know what she means.

510
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,002
We can't sit back calmly and
wait to see who kills him first.

511
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,004
Vandamm and company or the police.

512
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,926
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

513
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,720
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

514
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,682
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

515
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,061
We didn't invent our nonexistent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

516
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,022
...and establish elaborate
behavior patterns for him...

517
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,942
...and move his prop belongings
in and out of hotel rooms...

518
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,361
...for our own private amusement.

519
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,697
We created George Kaplan...

520
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,158
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

521
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:57,203
...that this was our own agent hot on his
trail for a desperately important reason.

522
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,581
- Check.
- Nobody's denying that!

523
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,082
Very well, then.

524
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,378
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there is no such agent as George Kaplan...

525
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,173
...give any hint to Vandamm
that he's pursuing a decoy...

526
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,133
...instead of our own agent...

527
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,887
...then our agent,
working right under Vandamm's very nose...

528
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,223
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

529
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,559
...and assassination.

530
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,145
Like the two others who went before.

531
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,733
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill,
wherever you are.

532
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,993
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

533
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,914
...the 20th Century Limited...

534
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:45,919
...due to leave at 6 p.m. for Chicago...

535
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:52,383
- ...will depart from plank number 30.
- Yes. Yes, dear. I know.

536
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,887
Now, listen to me, Mother, I beg you.
I called the Plaza.

537
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,182
Kaplan checked out. He went
to the hotel Ambassador East in Chicago.

538
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,434
Yes, that's why I'm...

539
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,145
Well, I can't go to the police.
At least not yet.

540
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,023
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife...

541
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,401
...I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and I murdered a man for revenge.

542
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,903
I wouldn't have a chance.

543
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,407
And I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is all about.

544
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,327
No, dear, the train. It's safer.

545
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,581
Well, because there's no place to hide
on a plane if anyone should recognize me.

546
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,335
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

547
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,464
Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Yeah, well, goodbye.

548
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,136
Attention, please.

549
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:43,101
New York Central Railroad,
train number 25...

550
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,437
...the 20th Century Limited...

551
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,608
...due to leave at 6 p.m.

552
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,669
Yeah.

553
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,463
Uh, give me a bedroom on
the 20th Century, please.

554
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,007
It's leaving in five minutes.

555
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,677
- Yes, I know. Could you make it snappy?
- I think they're all sold out.

556
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,555
- Sold out?
- You can always go coach.

557
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,349
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

558
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,603
Nothing till 10. You're in a hurry, huh?

559
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,564
Well, could you call them
and see what they have?

560
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,399
Something wrong with your eyes?

561
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,527
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

562
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,529
Sure. Sure.

563
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,284
Don't go away.

564
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:53,421
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

565
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,716
You're in luck, mister, you...

566
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,017
- Ticket?
- I'm just seeing some friends off.

567
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,521
Sorry, I have to know their names
before I can let you through.

568
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,731
Come here! Hey, come here!

569
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,262
Oh.

570
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,517
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- My fault.

571
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,936
Sorry.

572
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,280
He went that way. I think he got off.

573
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,282
All aboard!

574
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,996
- Thank you.
- It's quite all right.

575
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,625
- Seven parking tickets.
- Oh.

576
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,623
- Good evening, sir. One?
- Please.

577
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,471
Cocktail before dinner?

578
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,890
- Yes, please. A Gibson.
- Right away.

579
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,237
- Well, here we are again.
- Yes.

580
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,616
- Do you recommend anything?
- The brook trout.

581
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,827
A little trouty, but quite good.

582
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,578
Sold.

583
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,375
Brook trout.

584
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,752
- There you are. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

585
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,268
- I know. I look vaguely familiar.
- Yes.

586
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,353
You feel you've seen me somewhere before.

587
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,105
Mm-hm.

588
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,693
Funny how I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

589
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,153
It's a nice face.

590
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,991
- You think so?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

591
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,369
- Oh, you're that type.
- What type?

592
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,079
Honest.

593
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,372
Not really.

594
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,793
- Good. Because honest women frighten me.
- Why?

595
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,796
I don't know. Somehow,
they seem to put me at a disadvantage.

596
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,216
- Because you're not honest with them?
- Exactly.

597
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,469
Like that business
about the seven parking tickets?

598
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:15,057
Well, what I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

599
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,853
...I have to start pretending
I've no desire to make love to her.

600
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,856
What makes you think you have
to conceal it?

601
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,983
She might find the idea objectionable.

602
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,152
Then again, she might not.

603
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,408
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

604
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,036
Oh, luck had nothing to do with it.

605
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,954
Fate?

606
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,084
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

607
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,256
Is that a proposition?

608
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,427
I never discuss love
on an empty stomach.

609
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,596
You've already eaten.

610
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,431
But you haven't.

611
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,982
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

612
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,195
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

613
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,406
Now you know everything.

614
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,494
Tell me. What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

615
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,871
I'm an industrial designer.

616
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,377
Jack Phillips. Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

617
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:28,506
No, you're not.
You're Roger Thornhill of Madison Avenue...

618
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,842
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

619
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,470
And don't be so modest.

620
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,097
Whoops.

621
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,057
Oh, don't worry.

622
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,559
- I won't say a word.
- How come?

623
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,646
I told you.

624
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,022
It's a nice face.

625
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,732
Is that the only reason?

626
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,235
It's going to be a long night.

627
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,404
True.

628
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,240
And I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

629
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,326
You know what I mean?

630
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,997
Let me think.

631
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,002
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.

632
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,558
There's my trademark. R.O.T.

633
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,687
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

634
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,731
Nothing.

635
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,298
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

636
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,134
- A roomette?
- Nothing, not even a ticket.

637
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,472
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

638
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,641
- How awkward for you.
- Yes, isn't it?

639
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,060
No place to sleep.

640
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,646
I have a large drawing room all to myself.

641
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,274
That doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

642
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,277
Drawing room E.

643
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,279
Car 3901.

644
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,615
Such a nice number.

645
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,826
It's easy to remember.

646
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,787
Thirty-nine-oh-one.

647
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,747
See?

648
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,333
No luggage.

649
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,505
- So?
- Well, you wouldn't happen...

650
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,216
...to have an extra pair of pajamas,
would you?

651
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,634
Wouldn't I?

652
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,806
Incidentally, I wouldn't order any dessert
if I were you.

653
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,015
I get the message.

654
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,601
That isn't exactly what I meant.

655
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,354
This train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

656
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:52,525
And I just saw two men get out of a
police car as we pulled into the station.

657
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,360
They weren't smiling.

658
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,385
I think you better go out and
tell those police to hurry.

659
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,137
Patience is a virtue.

660
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,721
So is breathing.

661
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,266
Just lie still.

662
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,852
Have you got any olive oil?

663
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,311
Olive oil?

664
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,398
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm gonna be a sardine.

665
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,609
Come in.

666
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,488
- Who are you?
- State police.

667
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,574
Your name please?

668
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,243
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

669
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,580
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

670
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,583
- Yes.
- Friend of yours?

671
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,334
I never saw him before.

672
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,671
Is this the man?

673
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,842
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

674
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,928
It's a Wirephoto.
We just got it from the New York police.

675
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,097
- Police?
- He's wanted for murder.

676
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,267
Good heavens, no.

677
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,562
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

678
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,524
We might have happened to leave
at the same time, but not together.

679
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,610
What did you two talk about?

680
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,695
Talk about?

681
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,324
Your waiter said you were getting along
good with this Thornhill.

682
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,326
Is that his name? Thornhill?

683
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,245
You mean, he didn't tell you?

684
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,581
He didn't tell me anything.

685
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,959
All we did was chat
about different kinds of food...

686
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,087
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

687
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:42,218
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

688
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,304
- Who did he kill?
- He didn't say where he was going, did he?

689
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,308
No. I assumed Chicago.

690
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,560
You think perhaps he got off
when you got on?

691
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,064
If you happen
to catch sight of him again, Miss, uh...

692
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,315
Kendall.

693
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,317
...will you let us know?

694
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,986
I'm going to bed
and I intend to lock my door.

695
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,489
So I doubt if I'll seeing
anybody else tonight.

696
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,952
Well, just in case you do, we'll be in the
observation car at the rear of the train.

697
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,495
It's comforting to know that.

698
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,289
Good night.

699
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,626
Still breathing?

700
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,879
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

701
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,675
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

702
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,348
Hello, there.

703
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,141
Hello.

704
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,898
Hmm.

705
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,447
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

706
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,701
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

707
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,843
You know, I've been thinking,
it's not safe for you...

708
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,971
...to roam around Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan man...

709
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,140
...you've been telling me about.

710
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,436
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

711
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,229
Such a nice face too.

712
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:25,195
Now, don't you think it would be a better
idea if you stayed in my hotel room...

713
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,575
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

714
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,578
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

715
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,164
I'm a big girl.

716
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,001
Yeah, and in all the right places too.

717
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,842
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

718
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,093
Yes.

719
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,387
I mean, we've hardly met.

720
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,222
That's right.

721
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,059
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

722
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,852
You don't.

723
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,689
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

724
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,775
Shall I?

725
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,235
Please do.

726
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,800
Beats flying, doesn't it?

727
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,804
We should stop.

728
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,764
Immediately.

729
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,141
I ought to know more about you.

730
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,310
What more could you know?

731
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,982
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

732
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,901
That's right.

733
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,905
Train's a little unsteady.

734
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,990
Who isn't?

735
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,159
What else do you know?

736
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,581
You've got taste in clothes,
taste in food...

737
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,337
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

738
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,222
You're very clever with words.

739
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,183
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

740
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,603
Sell people things they don't need...

741
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,357
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

742
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,237
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

743
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,294
Look out.

744
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,305
Oh, porter.

745
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,183
- Don't bother with the washroom.
- Yes, ma'am.

746
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,144
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

747
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,396
Yes, ma'am.
I've been looking all over for it.

748
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,732
- I'll wait outside.
- Thank you.

749
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,833
Thank you, porter.

750
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,919
Thank you, ma'am. Good night, now.

751
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,754
Good night.

752
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,093
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

753
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,600
The porter.

754
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,187
So I see.

755
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,402
Now...

756
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,490
- ...where were we?
- Here.

757
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,786
Oh, yes.

758
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,249
- Nice of him to have opened the bed.
- Yes.

759
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,919
- Only one bed.
- Yes.

760
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,380
That's a good omen, don't you think?

761
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,298
Wonderful.

762
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,885
- Do you know what that means?
- Mm-hm.

763
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,595
What? Tell me.

764
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,432
It means you're going
to sleep on the floor.

765
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,582
A message from the lady in 3901.

766
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,544
- You keep walking. I'll catch up.
- Yes, ma'am.

767
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:38,300
- Anything to report, Miss Kendall?
- Why, yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

768
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,511
No, I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

769
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,223
- Mr. Thornycroft?
- Thornhill.

770
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,269
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

771
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,521
But good luck to you both.

772
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,404
- How are we doing?
- Oh, I may collapse at any moment.

773
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,948
Not yet.
First we have to run the gauntlet. Look.

774
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,241
Hmm?

775
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:12,084
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

776
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,003
- Bowling balls, naturally.
- Oh, naturally.

777
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:19,424
- Which one of these has my suit in it?
- The small one underneath your right arm.

778
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,094
Oh, thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

779
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,680
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan
won't mind a few wrinkles.

780
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,432
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

781
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,850
Nine-ten.

782
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,770
Nine-ten? Well, he may have left
his hotel room by now.

783
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,606
I'll call him for you
as soon as we get inside the station.

784
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,274
No thank you, I can do it.

785
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,820
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

786
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:43,115
I, uh... Well, all right. What are
you gonna tell him? Do you know that?

787
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:47,452
Mm-hm. You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

788
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,788
- Mm-hm. Right.
- No explanations.

789
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,374
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

790
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,961
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

791
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,547
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

792
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,465
Did you, now?

793
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,469
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

794
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,816
I think we made it.

795
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,529
Where did he go?

796
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,489
- Which way did he go?
- Where did he go?

797
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,033
I don't know. He took my clothes.
And went that way.

798
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,326
Come on.

799
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:11,346
Departing at 10 a.m.,
Chicago daylight time...

800
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,224
...for Michigan City.

801
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,416
Now ready on track number six.

802
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,088
Well, what took you so long?

803
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,425
Well, I have a big face, small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

804
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,927
- Yes.
- Fine. What did he say?

805
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,139
Well, he'll see you, but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

806
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,641
- He'll see you on the outside.
- Well, where? When?

807
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,060
- I've got it all written down for you.
- Thanks.

808
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,521
Take the Greyhound bus
that leaves Chicago...

809
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:07,694
...for Indianapolis at 2 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41.

810
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,988
Prairie Stop, Highway 41. Good.

811
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,490
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

812
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:13,700
Fine. I'll rent a car.

813
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:18,371
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

814
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,041
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

815
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,585
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

816
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,754
- Well, how will I know him?
- He'll know you.

817
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,549
- You made the Chicago papers too.
- Oh, yes.

818
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,843
Have you got your watch set
for Central time?

819
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,012
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

820
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,682
- What's the matter?
- Matter?

821
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,143
Yes, you seem... I don't know.
You seem tense.

822
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,188
You know, you better go before the police
run out of redcaps.

823
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,899
We'll see each other again, won't we?

824
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,817
Sometime, I'm sure.

825
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,279
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

826
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:54,658
- Please go.
- Yes, but... But where will I find you?

827
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,618
I've gotta pick up my bags now.

828
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,871
Oh, yes. Well, these are the checks
for the large cases.

829
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,373
Wait a minute.

830
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,792
Please.

831
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,711
They're coming.

832
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,392
Hi.

833
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,272
- Hot day.
- Seen worse.

834
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,818
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

835
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,656
- Waiting for the bus. Due any minute.
- Oh.

836
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,743
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich,
if they live long enough.

837
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,371
Yeah.

838
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,166
And, uh, then your name isn't Kaplan?

839
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,127
Can't say it is, because it ain't.

840
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,422
Here she comes. Right on time.

841
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,719
- That's funny.
- What?

842
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:09,639
That plane's dusting crops
where there ain't no crops.

843
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,667
Get out of here!
The other tank may blow!

844
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,596
What happened?

845
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,080
Hey!

846
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,457
Come back! Hey!

847
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:51,045
Come back! Come back! Hey!

848
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,469
- Yes?
- Uh...

849
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,848
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?

850
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,308
- Kaplan?
- Yeah.

851
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:48,185
I think he checked out.

852
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,187
- He checked out?
- That's right.

853
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,356
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.

854
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:56,193
- Seven-ten? Are you sure?
- Yes. He left a forwarding address.

855
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:59,322
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.

856
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,282
Seven-ten?

857
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,035
Well, then how come I got a message
from him at 9...?

858
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:05,703
What's that?

859
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,499
Nothing. Nothing.

860
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,237
Sorry to bother you again.

861
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:43,282
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.

862
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,077
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?

863
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:58,422
- She's in 463.
- Oh, yes, that's right. Thanks.

864
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,950
Hello.

865
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,207
Surprised?

866
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,292
Yes.

867
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,254
No getting rid of me, is there?

868
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,309
I could use a drink.

869
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,356
- I have some Scotch.
- With water. No ice.

870
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,867
How did it go today?

871
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:14,749
- The meeting with Kaplan?
- Uh-huh.

872
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,917
He didn't show up.

873
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,170
Oh?

874
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:21,005
It's funny, isn't it?

875
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:22,506
Why funny?

876
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:28,387
Oh, after all those involved and explicit
directions he gave you on the phone.

877
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:33,434
- Maybe I copied them down wrong.
- I don't think you got them wrong.

878
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,104
I think you sent me to the right place,
all right.

879
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:41,275
Why don't you call him back again
and see what happened?

880
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,529
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.

881
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,490
South Dakota?

882
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,533
Rapid City.

883
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,620
Well, what are you going to do next?

884
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,039
I haven't made my mind up yet.

885
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,792
It may depend on you.

886
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,796
- On me?
- Sure.

887
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:05,090
You're my little helper, aren't you?

888
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:10,221
Thank you. To us.
To a long and lasting friendship.

889
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:15,100
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.

890
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:17,311
I'm afraid you'll have to.

891
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,981
- Oh, no.
- I do have plans of my own, you know?

892
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,900
And you do have problems.

893
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:28,072
Well, wouldn't it be nice if my problems
and your plans were somehow connected?

894
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,533
Then we could always stay close
to each other...

895
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,952
...and not have to go off
in separate directions.

896
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,830
Togetherness. You know what I mean?

897
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,710
Go ahead, it can't be for me.

898
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:50,803
Hello?

899
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,680
Yes.

900
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,182
No, not yet. I'm not ready.

901
01:20:55,642 --> 01:21:00,354
What time?
I'll meet you. What's the address?

902
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,609
Yes. Goodbye.

903
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,363
Business?

904
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,783
- Yes.
- Industrial-designing business?

905
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,577
Mm-hm.

906
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,749
All work and no play? A girl like you
should be enjoying herself this evening...

907
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:24,295
...instead of taking phone calls
from clients.

908
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,840
What about having dinner with me?

909
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:32,720
- You can't afford to be seen anyplace.
- Well, let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.

910
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,638
No, I...

911
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,932
I can't.

912
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,852
I insist.

913
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,647
I want you to do a favor for me.

914
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,275
- A big, big favor.
- Name it.

915
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,278
I want you to leave right now.

916
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,740
Stay far away from me
and don't come near me again.

917
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,912
We're not going to get involved.

918
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:01,165
Last night was last night
and that's all there was.

919
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,002
That's all there is. There isn't going
to be anything more between us.

920
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,546
So, please...

921
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:08,756
Goodbye.

922
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,675
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.

923
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:15,304
- Right away?
- Yes.

924
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:16,847
No questions asked?

925
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,307
Yes.

926
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,186
- No, I can't do that.
- Please.

927
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,855
- After dinner.
- Now.

928
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,691
After dinner. Fair is fair.

929
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,195
All right.

930
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,405
On one condition.

931
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:37,660
That you let the hotel valet
do something with this suit first.

932
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:40,037
You belong in the stockyards
looking like that.

933
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,914
Okay.

934
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,917
There's the phone.

935
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,132
Hello. Valet service, please.

936
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,554
Hello, valet?

937
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,101
- Oh, this is r... Where are we?
- Four sixty-three.

938
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:04,061
Room 463.

939
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,647
How quickly can you get a suit
sponged and pressed?

940
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,565
Yes, fast.

941
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:13,237
Twenty minutes? Fine. Okay, 463.

942
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,324
He'll be right up.

943
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,785
Better take your things off.

944
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:25,958
Now, what could a man do
with his clothes off for 20 minutes?

945
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,668
Couldn't he have taken an hour?

946
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,795
You could always take a cold shower.

947
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,714
That's right.

948
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,093
You know, when I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.

949
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,971
- You're a big boy now.
- Yes.

950
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:46,103
Tell me, how does a girl like you
get to be a girl like you?

951
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,772
Lucky, I guess.

952
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:53,610
Oh, not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good. Ever kill anyone?

953
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:58,532
Because I bet you could tease a man
to death without half-trying.

954
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,409
So stop trying, huh?

955
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,963
Be with you in a minute.

956
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,845
- Huh?
- Trousers, please.

957
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:22,097
There you are.

958
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,645
Thank you.

959
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,982
I think I'll take that
cold shower after all.

960
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,317
Good.

961
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,765
This magnificent pair
of Louis XVI fauteuils.

962
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:50,561
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.

963
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:53,689
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?

964
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,733
- One hundred.
- One hundred is bid. Thank you.

965
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:59,361
One-fifty is bid here. Say the 200?

966
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:00,737
Thank you, 200 is bid.

967
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:05,993
Say the 300? I have 300.
Four hundred by the little lady.

968
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,202
Thank you, sir.

969
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,705
Four-fifty is bid for the pair.
Can I hear 500?

970
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,415
Will you say 500?

971
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,500
Can I say the 500?

972
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,586
Fair warning and last call.

973
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:20,257
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row.
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

974
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,181
And now lot number 103.

975
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,683
This lovely Aubusson settee.

976
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,645
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.

977
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:35,439
How much?

978
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,526
Eight hundred is offered, thank you.
Eight hundred is bid. Say the nine? Go 900?

979
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,112
Nine hundred is bid.
Now, who'll say 1,000?

980
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:46,116
One thousand, thank you.
One thousand at 1,000. Say 1,100?

981
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:50,704
- Can I hear 1,100? Selling at $1,000.
- The three of you together.

982
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,832
Now, that's a picture only
Charles Addams could draw.

983
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,626
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.

984
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,879
Before we start calling each other
names, you better tell me yours.

985
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,965
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- You disappoint me, sir.

986
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,509
I was just going to say that to her.

987
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:07,554
I've always understood you were
a shrewd fellow at your job.

988
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,557
What possessed you
to come blundering in here like this?

989
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,935
Could it be an overpowering interest
in art?

990
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,812
Yes. The art of survival.

991
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:19,149
Well, have you poured
any good drunks lately?

992
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,402
- One hundred dollars.
- He followed me here from the hotel.

993
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,197
He was in your room?

994
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,907
Sure, isn't everybody?

995
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,910
One hundred and fifty. Thank you.
Now, say the two.

996
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,037
Do I hear two? Two hundred, thank you.

997
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:35,165
Now the three. Do I hear three?
Three hundred, anyone?

998
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,919
Three hundred, thank you. Now, the four.
Do I hear four? Four hundred, anyone?

999
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:43,548
Four hundred is bid. Say the five?
I have 400. I have 400.

1000
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:47,469
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.

1001
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,473
- Five hundred.
- Five hundred, thank you.

1002
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,559
I'll bet you paid plenty
for this little piece of sculpture.

1003
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:57,187
- Now the seven. Seven hundred?
- Seven hundred.

1004
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,982
She's worth every dollar of it,
take it from me.

1005
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,026
Now, she puts her heart into her work.

1006
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,654
In fact, her whole body.

1007
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,031
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at 700.

1008
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:13,704
- Number 106 for your pleasure.
- Oh, Mr. Vandamm.

1009
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:17,582
Has anyone ever told you that you overplay
your various roles rather severely...

1010
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,042
...Mr. Kaplan?

1011
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,420
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...

1012
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,880
...who claims he's been mistaken
for someone else.

1013
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,882
Then, you play the fugitive...

1014
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:29,553
...supposedly trying to clear his name
of a crime he knows he didn't commit.

1015
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:34,474
Now you play the peevish lover,
stung by jealousy and betrayal.

1016
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,145
It seems you fellows could stand
less training from the FBI...

1017
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,273
- ...and more from the Actors Studio.
- Three-fifty I have.

1018
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,068
Apparently, the only performance
that'll satisfy you is when I play dead.

1019
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,405
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.

1020
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:52,034
Don't lose it for $25. Thank you.
Three-seventy-five is bid.

1021
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,244
I have 375, go the 400.

1022
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,872
Three-seventy-five, go four?
Four hundred is bid.

1023
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,376
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter
is next on the program.

1024
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:03,962
Am I to be dropped
into a vat of molten steel...

1025
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,798
...and become part of a new skyscraper?

1026
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:11,845
Or are you going to ask this female
to kiss me again and poison me to death?

1027
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,181
We offer catalog number 107.

1028
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,602
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.

1029
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:24,691
How much to start the bidding
on this collector's porcelain?

1030
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,026
Please start the bidding.

1031
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,236
Kaplan, we've had just about enough
of you.

1032
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:30,364
Then, why don't you send for the police?

1033
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:35,535
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.

1034
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,746
There's something I might tell them.

1035
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:40,624
That's the reason you had this one
hustle me on the train.

1036
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,628
Something seems to tell me I've got a
better chance if I go to the police.

1037
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,548
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.

1038
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:53,637
Say the 12. Twelve hundred dollars
there. Twelve hundred is bid. Say 1300?

1039
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,722
May I hear 1300?

1040
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,725
They're selling at 1200.
Do I hear 1300, please?

1041
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,436
Last call.

1042
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:05,357
Sold. Twelve hundred dollars. Thank you.

1043
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,573
And now catalog number 109.

1044
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,412
This superb example
of this early 17th century master.

1045
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,831
It will enhance any collection of fine art.

1046
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,626
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?

1047
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:28,338
- One thousand dollars.
- One thousand is bid.

1048
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:31,508
Twelve-fifty I have. Now, 1500.

1049
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,262
Fifteen hundred is bid. Thank you.
Seventeen-fifty?

1050
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:39,433
- I have 1750.
- Two thousand dollars.

1051
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,020
Two thousand is bid. I have 2000.
Do I hear 2500?

1052
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,314
Twenty-five hundred, anyone?

1053
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:47,524
Twenty-two-fifty once.

1054
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,027
Twenty-two-fifty twice.

1055
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,156
- Last call.
- Fifteen hundred.

1056
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:59,286
- Well, the bid is already up to 2250, sir.
- I still say 1,500.

1057
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:05,792
I have 2250. Do I hear 25?

1058
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,671
- Twenty-two-fifty once, 2250 twice.
- Twelve hundred.

1059
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:14,342
- Sold for 2250. And now...
- Twenty-two-fifty for that chromo?

1060
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:21,224
Number 110 in the catalog.

1061
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,853
A Louis XV carved
and gilded lit de repos.

1062
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,939
Would somebody start the bidding
at $750, please?

1063
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:30,859
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.

1064
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:38,533
Well, one thing we know:
You're no fake. You're a genuine idiot.

1065
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:40,243
Thank you.

1066
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,829
I wonder if I could respectfully ask
the gentleman...

1067
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,081
...to get into the spirit
of the proceedings.

1068
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,833
All right. I'll start it at 8.

1069
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,921
Eight hundred. Thank you. Nine hundred?

1070
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,591
- One thousand is bid. Go 12?
- Eleven.

1071
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:58,094
Eleven is bid. Thank you. Go 12.

1072
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:01,765
I have 11. Go 12. Who'll say 12?

1073
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,142
Eleven once. Who'll say 12?

1074
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,937
Eleven twice. Twelve, thank you.

1075
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:10,315
Twelve is bid. I have 12. Go 13.
Who'll say 13?

1076
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:11,608
Thirteen dollars.

1077
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:15,737
You mean 1300, sir.

1078
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,449
No, no, no, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.

1079
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,578
I...

1080
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:27,749
I have 1200. Go 13. Who'll say 13?

1081
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,210
Who'll say 1250?

1082
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,423
Twelve hundred once, 1200 twice.

1083
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:37,801
- Last call. Twelve hundred.
- Two thousand.

1084
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:42,389
Two thousand?

1085
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:45,475
Twenty-one hundred.

1086
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:48,353
I'm sorry, sir, but we can't...

1087
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,939
- Make it 2500.
- Ask him to leave.

1088
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:59,739
- Would the gentleman please cooperate?
- The last bid was 1200.

1089
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:03,326
Twenty-five hundred.
My money's as good as anybody's.

1090
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,162
- Well, isn't it? Isn't it?
- I have...

1091
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:08,665
- What was it?
- Twelve hundred.

1092
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:12,085
I have 1200 once, 1200 twice.

1093
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,672
- Three thousand.
- Sold for 1200.

1094
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:21,177
- I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
- You'd better leave, sir.

1095
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:23,513
No, you take your hands off me
or I'll sue you.

1096
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,322
- What took you so long?
- Let's take a little walk.

1097
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:42,699
- Get moving.
- I haven't finished bidding yet.

1098
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,535
Three thousand. I bid 3000.

1099
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,455
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.

1100
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,708
Not so rough.

1101
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,843
- Handle with care, fellas.
- In there.

1102
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,387
- I'm valuable property.
- In.

1103
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:12,020
Well, I want to thank you for saving my
life. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

1104
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:14,564
Save it for the station house.

1105
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:21,488
Well, let's have some smiles
and good cheer.

1106
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:25,575
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?

1107
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:29,663
We'll find out as soon as we book you
for being drunk and disorderly.

1108
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:33,166
Drunk and disorderly? That's chicken feed.
You've hit the jackpot.

1109
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:37,837
Chicago police capture
United Nations killer.

1110
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:39,964
My name is Roger Thornhill.

1111
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:41,925
Here.

1112
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:48,431
- It's him.
- That's right. Congratulations, man.

1113
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:50,183
Yeah.

1114
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,602
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.

1115
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:56,981
We've got a man here who answers
to the description of Thornhill, Roger.

1116
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:58,817
Code 76.

1117
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:02,946
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.

1118
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,115
Absolutely. No question.

1119
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:10,203
Michigan Avenue.
Proceeding north to 42nd precinct.

1120
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:14,916
What?

1121
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:17,377
Come again?

1122
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:21,589
Are you sure?

1123
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,342
Okay. Right.

1124
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,010
Yeah, I got it.

1125
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:28,555
One-oh-five-five, off and clear.

1126
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,642
- Where are we going?
- Airport.

1127
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,603
- For what?
- Orders.

1128
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:37,981
Airport? I don't wanna be taken
to an airport.

1129
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,985
- I want to be taken to police headquarters.
- You do, huh?

1130
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,820
Why do you think I sent for you?

1131
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,906
How about this guy, Charlie?
He sent for us.

1132
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,908
- Sit back.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

1133
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:52,203
I want to be taken to police headquarters.
I'm a dangerous assassin.

1134
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:56,499
- I'm a mad killer on the loose.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1135
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:23,860
They said right here.

1136
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:27,363
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

1137
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:41,669
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

1138
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:43,630
All right, men. Thank you.

1139
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,049
- This way, Mr. Thornhill.
- Wait a minute.

1140
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,677
We haven't much time.
Yeah, this way is more private.

1141
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:57,352
- I don't think I caught your name.
- I don't think I pitched it.

1142
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,396
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

1143
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:02,357
FBI, CIA, ONI.

1144
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:04,859
- We're all in the same alphabet soup.
- Really?

1145
01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:08,988
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

1146
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:11,282
- We know that.
- You know it?

1147
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,118
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

1148
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:18,373
We never interfere with the police,
unless absolutely necessary.

1149
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,917
- It's become necessary.
- Oh, I see.

1150
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,211
Well, then, I take it
I'm going to be cleared.

1151
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,381
I do wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

1152
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,633
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

1153
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:31,052
Rapid City, South Dakota.

1154
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,722
- Rapid City? What for?
- It's near Mount Rushmore.

1155
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,766
No, thank you.
I've seen Mount Rushmore.

1156
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,561
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

1157
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,688
Vandamm?

1158
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:44,607
A rather formidable
kind of gentleman, eh?

1159
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:47,068
What about that treacherous little tramp
with him?

1160
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:48,486
- Miss Kendall?
- Yeah.

1161
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,989
His mistress. We know all about her.

1162
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:54,450
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

1163
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:57,495
Oh, you could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

1164
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:58,997
Of what?

1165
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:01,958
Oh. Government secrets, perhaps.

1166
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,294
Well, then why don't you grab him?

1167
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:07,297
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

1168
01:38:07,464 --> 01:38:08,798
Oh, I see.

1169
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,217
What's all this got to do
with Mount Rushmore?

1170
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,720
Well, Vandamm has a place near there.

1171
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:17,223
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

1172
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,809
- Are you gonna stop him?
- No.

1173
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,811
Well, then what are we going there for?

1174
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,980
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

1175
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,484
Oh, you, huh?
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

1176
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:31,821
Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill.
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

1177
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,865
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

1178
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,951
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff.

1179
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,829
Believe me, Mr. Thornhill,
he doesn't exist.

1180
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:45,919
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

1181
01:38:46,086 --> 01:38:48,504
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.

1182
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:14,113
Now, look. You started this decoy business
without me, you finish it without me.

1183
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,366
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1184
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:20,203
You ought to give me a medal
instead of asking me to be a target...

1185
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,373
...just so your special agent or whatever
doesn't get shot at.

1186
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:28,586
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.

1187
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:32,548
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

1188
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,300
Thanks to me?

1189
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,886
- If you'll get on the plane...
- You listen to me.

1190
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:41,641
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1191
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,560
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1192
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:48,022
...and I don't intend to disappoint
them all by getting myself killed.

1193
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:50,441
The answer is no.

1194
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,902
- Is that final?
- Yes.

1195
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,154
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

1196
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:58,825
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.

1197
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:01,744
Of whom you so obviously disapprove.

1198
01:40:01,912 --> 01:40:05,415
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly swatter.

1199
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,917
I don't suppose it would matter to you...

1200
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:12,088
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1201
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,465
To protect herself from what?

1202
01:40:14,633 --> 01:40:17,510
Exposure and assassination.

1203
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,763
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she...

1204
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,307
She's one of our agents.

1205
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:26,811
- Oh, no.
- I know you didn't mean it...

1206
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:31,566
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

1207
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:35,319
And much more than her life is at stake.

1208
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,212
- Suppose they don't come?
- They'll come.

1209
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,134
I don't like the way Teddy
Roosevelt is looking at me.

1210
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:02,180
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

1211
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,390
Speak soft, and carry a big stick.

1212
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:08,061
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

1213
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:11,481
He doesn't know to what extent
you're the cause of our present trouble.

1214
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,650
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge, professor.

1215
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:18,237
Dear, fellow, if you hadn't made yourself
so attractive to Miss Kendall...

1216
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:20,865
- ...that she fell for you...
- And vice versa.

1217
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:24,327
...our friend Vandamm wouldn't
be losing faith in her loyalty now.

1218
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:28,664
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1219
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:33,086
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1220
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:35,755
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

1221
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:39,425
I'm trying to remind you it is your
responsibility to help us restore her...

1222
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:41,010
...to Vandamm's good graces...

1223
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:44,180
...right up to the point
he leaves the country tonight.

1224
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:45,681
All right, all right.

1225
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:47,850
But, after tonight...

1226
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:50,853
My blessings on you both.

1227
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:06,994
Here they are.

1228
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:03,509
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
- Not her.

1229
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:15,396
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

1230
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,773
We'll get to that later.

1231
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,568
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

1232
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:24,572
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

1233
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:27,617
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

1234
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:29,952
...from the auction gallery.

1235
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,287
Thank you.

1236
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,415
And now, what little drama
are we here for today?

1237
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:38,336
I don't for a moment believe that you've
invited me to these gay surroundings...

1238
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:40,880
...to come to a business arrangement.

1239
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:46,677
Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact
time you're leaving the country tonight...

1240
01:43:46,845 --> 01:43:49,388
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

1241
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,807
...and your ultimate destination.

1242
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:54,644
You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me,
would you?

1243
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:58,064
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

1244
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:01,817
- The price?
- For doing nothing to stop you.

1245
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:05,321
How much did you have in mind?

1246
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:07,740
I want the girl.

1247
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:12,912
I want the girl to get
what's coming to her.

1248
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,457
Turn her over to me, I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

1249
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,335
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

1250
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:23,047
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

1251
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,591
She really did get under your skin.

1252
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:28,594
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

1253
01:44:28,762 --> 01:44:32,765
- I'm offering you a chance to save it.
- To exchange it.

1254
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:34,684
Put it any way you like.

1255
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:37,687
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

1256
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:41,274
What made you arrive at the deduction that
my feelings for Miss Kendall...

1257
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:46,779
...have deteriorated to the point where
I would trade her in for peace of mind?

1258
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:50,032
I don't deduce. I observe.

1259
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:55,830
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.

1260
01:45:08,093 --> 01:45:09,218
Just a second, you.

1261
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:13,014
Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.

1262
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:15,474
Stay away from me. Let go.

1263
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:17,310
Let go of me.

1264
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:21,230
- Now, save the phony tears.
- You just get back.

1265
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:25,985
- You little fool.
- You just stay away from me.

1266
01:45:31,366 --> 01:45:33,576
No good, sir.
You can't get involved in this.

1267
01:45:38,081 --> 01:45:40,082
- Don't touch anything.
- Stand back.

1268
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,334
Stand back.

1269
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:34,970
Mr. Thornhill?

1270
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:44,313
Don't be long.

1271
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:49,777
Hello.

1272
01:46:50,362 --> 01:46:51,862
Hello.

1273
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,864
Are you all right?

1274
01:46:54,866 --> 01:46:56,700
Yes, I think so.

1275
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:59,703
I asked the professor
if I could see you again.

1276
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:04,041
There's not much time.

1277
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:06,836
Isn't there?

1278
01:47:07,712 --> 01:47:09,797
I wanted to tell you...

1279
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:11,257
I mean, apologize.

1280
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,343
No need.

1281
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:17,263
I understand.

1282
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,350
All in the line of duty.

1283
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:24,812
I did treat you miserably.

1284
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,689
I, uh...

1285
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,941
I hated you for it.

1286
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,444
I didn't want you to go on
thinking that I...

1287
01:47:32,946 --> 01:47:36,699
And I... I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.

1288
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,701
They hurt deeply.

1289
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,079
- Well, naturally, if I'd known...
- I couldn't tell you.

1290
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:43,998
- Of course not.
- Could I?

1291
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:47,293
No, I guess not.

1292
01:47:49,379 --> 01:47:52,506
- You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
- Of course I was hurt.

1293
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:55,384
- How would you have felt?
- In the cafeteria, when you fell.

1294
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:59,054
- When I shot you with the blanks.
- Oh, that. No.

1295
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:04,059
- You did it rather well, I thought.
- Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

1296
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,730
Considering
it's not really your kind of work.

1297
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:12,818
Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

1298
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:18,616
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

1299
01:48:18,783 --> 01:48:20,242
Oh.

1300
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,246
I guess I had nothing to do
that weekend, so I...

1301
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:26,749
I decided to fall in love.

1302
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:29,543
Well, that's nice.

1303
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:35,257
Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1304
01:48:35,967 --> 01:48:40,429
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1305
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:44,558
...my relationship with him
made me uniquely valuable to them.

1306
01:48:44,893 --> 01:48:46,143
Mm-hm.

1307
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:49,230
So you became a Girl Scout, huh?

1308
01:48:49,397 --> 01:48:52,858
Maybe it was the first time anyone
ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.

1309
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:56,695
Has life been like that?

1310
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,450
How come?

1311
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,454
Men like you.

1312
01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:08,791
What's wrong with men like me?

1313
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:11,210
They don't believe in marriage.

1314
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,128
I've been married twice.

1315
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:14,421
See what I mean?

1316
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:19,635
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

1317
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:27,893
Goodbye, darling.

1318
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:32,523
- Wait a minute. Not so soon.
- No, I gotta get back and convince them...

1319
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:35,818
...that I took the long way around
so nobody followed me.

1320
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:39,947
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

1321
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,658
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded.

1322
01:49:42,826 --> 01:49:44,827
I never felt more alive.

1323
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,412
Well, whose side are you on?

1324
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:48,914
Yours, always, darling.

1325
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,918
Please don't undermine my resolve
just when I need it most.

1326
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:05,806
Oh, well, I guess it's off to the hospital
for me and back to danger for you.

1327
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:07,683
I don't like it a bit.

1328
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:11,895
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1329
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:14,315
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1330
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:16,066
All right. I won't.

1331
01:50:16,234 --> 01:50:19,486
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1332
01:50:19,654 --> 01:50:23,824
...you and I are gonna get together and do a
lot of apologizing to each other in private.

1333
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,286
- You know that can't be.
- Of course it can be.

1334
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,708
He has told you, hasn't he?

1335
01:50:33,209 --> 01:50:36,253
- Told me what?
- Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.

1336
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:39,715
- Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you?

1337
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:43,886
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1338
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:47,056
She's going off with Vandamm?

1339
01:50:47,223 --> 01:50:50,225
We went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1340
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:53,395
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline
to take her along.

1341
01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:56,398
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1342
01:50:57,359 --> 01:50:59,401
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight...

1343
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:02,279
- I needed your help.
- Well, you got it, all right.

1344
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:03,572
Don't be angry.

1345
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,991
You think I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

1346
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,827
- Oh, she has to.
- Nobody has to do anything.

1347
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,080
I don't like the games
you play, professor.

1348
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:15,042
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1349
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,337
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1350
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:21,715
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1351
01:51:21,883 --> 01:51:23,425
...and never come back...

1352
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:26,261
...perhaps you ought to learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1353
01:51:26,971 --> 01:51:29,473
I'm afraid we're already doing that.

1354
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:40,234
- I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
- Please don't spoil everything. Please.

1355
01:51:45,323 --> 01:51:49,410
...Mr. Kaplan twice in full view of
horrified men, women and children...

1356
01:51:49,577 --> 01:51:52,955
...who had come to the park to see
the famed Mount Rushmore monument.

1357
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:58,627
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant as
an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1358
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:02,589
Kaplan, who was removed to the Rapid
City Hospital in critical condition...

1359
01:52:02,757 --> 01:52:06,760
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1360
01:52:06,928 --> 01:52:09,346
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1361
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:12,725
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria...

1362
01:52:12,892 --> 01:52:15,894
...stated that he heard voices raised in...

1363
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:23,986
- Here we are.
- Hello.

1364
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,822
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1365
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,157
Thanks.

1366
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:31,910
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1367
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,997
For the next couple of days?

1368
01:52:35,623 --> 01:52:36,665
- Hey.
- What?

1369
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:37,916
What's this?

1370
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:41,211
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1371
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:43,547
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.

1372
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:47,509
- Otherwise, feeling all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

1373
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:50,804
Considering your driver
has a sledgehammer for a hand.

1374
01:52:50,972 --> 01:52:52,848
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1375
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:55,559
No, that's all right. I
guess I deserved it.

1376
01:52:56,352 --> 01:52:58,520
I guess I deserve that locked door too.

1377
01:52:58,688 --> 01:53:02,608
You seen wandering about in good health
could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.

1378
01:53:03,526 --> 01:53:06,528
- I've begun to forget her already.
- Good.

1379
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:09,198
- Better that way.
- Yeah, much.

1380
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:11,992
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1381
01:53:14,537 --> 01:53:18,415
- How's everything out in Rapid City?
- Oh, everything's fine.

1382
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:22,628
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1383
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:25,255
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1384
01:53:25,423 --> 01:53:27,007
Well, now you can include me.

1385
01:53:27,717 --> 01:53:29,885
- I'm a cooperator.
- I'm most grateful.

1386
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:33,472
- Care to do me a favor in return?
- Anything.

1387
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,767
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a...?
Get me some bourbon?

1388
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,477
A pint will do.

1389
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:40,062
Can I join you?

1390
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:43,357
Well, if you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1391
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:46,360
- See you in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

1392
01:54:50,466 --> 01:54:53,218
- Stop.
- Oh, excuse me.

1393
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,137
Stop.

1394
01:55:18,828 --> 01:55:21,830
- You don't want me to take you up there?
- No, thanks. Never mind.

1395
01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:23,498
Oh, thanks.

1396
01:58:07,955 --> 01:58:11,333
- There's nothing to worry about.
- I just lost my head.

1397
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:14,586
I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1398
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:16,129
I mean it.

1399
01:58:16,297 --> 01:58:18,340
I just didn't know what I was doing.

1400
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:21,009
He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

1401
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:23,678
- But not endanger you.
- Ah, rubbish.

1402
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:28,517
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

1403
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:31,853
What's the situation, Leonard?

1404
01:58:32,021 --> 01:58:34,231
- About the plane, you mean?
- Of course.

1405
01:58:34,398 --> 01:58:35,982
What was the last report?

1406
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:39,486
Over Whitestone on the hour,
6000, descending.

1407
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:42,364
- About ten minutes, huh?
- At the most.

1408
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,449
And now, uh...

1409
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:47,536
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1410
01:58:47,703 --> 01:58:49,329
Certainly.

1411
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:51,414
In private?

1412
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54,376
I'll go up and get my things.

1413
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:56,253
Well, Leonard...

1414
01:58:56,420 --> 01:59:00,257
...how does one say goodbye
to one's right arm?

1415
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,349
I'm afraid you're gonna wish
you had cut it off sooner.

1416
01:59:11,185 --> 01:59:12,602
Mm-hm.

1417
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,356
I know how terribly fond you are
of Miss Kendall...

1418
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:19,442
I don't find this a terribly attractive...

1419
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:26,032
- She is not to be trusted.
- You're being mysterious.

1420
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,535
I'm not being mysterious at all.

1421
02:00:01,652 --> 02:00:03,653
It couldn't have been anything.

1422
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,784
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1423
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:13,955
- And still do.
- Rubbish.

1424
02:00:14,373 --> 02:00:16,958
Why else would you have
decided not to tell her...

1425
02:00:17,126 --> 02:00:19,920
...that our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

1426
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:22,464
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

1427
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:24,633
Sometimes the truth
does taste like worms.

1428
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,093
The truth? I've heard nothing
but innuendoes.

1429
02:00:27,261 --> 02:00:31,097
Call it my woman's intuition if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

1430
02:00:31,265 --> 02:00:33,683
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

1431
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:36,311
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

1432
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:39,481
- You were there yourself. You saw it.
- Yes.

1433
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:46,321
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

1434
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:50,867
A, she removed any doubts
you may have had about her, uh...

1435
02:00:51,035 --> 02:00:53,828
Now, what did you call it, her devotion?

1436
02:00:53,996 --> 02:00:58,250
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

1437
02:00:58,417 --> 02:01:01,628
- ...in case you decided to change your mind.
- You know what I think?

1438
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:04,547
I think you're jealous.

1439
02:01:04,715 --> 02:01:07,842
No, I mean it,
and I'm very touched. Very...

1440
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:11,888
Leonard!

1441
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:20,689
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

1442
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:23,191
I found it in her luggage.

1443
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:28,196
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

1444
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,825
They've just freshened it up a bit
with blank cartridges.

1445
02:01:45,965 --> 02:01:47,048
What was that noise?

1446
02:01:50,052 --> 02:01:53,305
Yes, we wondered what it was too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

1447
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,349
Hurry, darling. It's almost time to leave.

1448
02:01:56,934 --> 02:01:58,018
In a moment.

1449
02:02:07,236 --> 02:02:09,571
You're not taking her on that plane
with you?

1450
02:02:09,739 --> 02:02:11,031
Of course I am.

1451
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:15,660
Like our friends,
I too believe in neatness, Leonard.

1452
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:19,914
This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

1453
02:02:20,082 --> 02:02:21,583
...over water.

1454
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:10,423
How about a little champagne
before we go?

1455
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:11,966
I'd love it.

1456
02:03:12,134 --> 02:03:15,303
- It may not be cold enough.
- Over the rocks will be all right.

1457
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:17,013
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

1458
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:19,391
My dear.

1459
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:33,214
Thank you.

1460
02:04:33,674 --> 02:04:37,177
To you, my dear, and all the lovely
moments we've had together.

1461
02:04:38,429 --> 02:04:39,971
Thank you, Phillip.

1462
02:04:40,389 --> 02:04:41,556
There he is.

1463
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:51,733
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.

1464
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:53,276
There isn't time.

1465
02:04:53,444 --> 02:04:56,404
You always were a spoilsport,
weren't you?

1466
02:04:56,572 --> 02:05:00,241
One of my most valuable attributes
as it now turns out.

1467
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:06,414
It would please me if you would think of me
as being along on this journey...

1468
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:10,502
- ...if only in spirit.
- I shall, Leonard.

1469
02:05:17,384 --> 02:05:20,803
He's heading pretty far out
on the north leg and awfully high.

1470
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:25,183
I guess he's gonna play it safe
with a long, slow descent.

1471
02:05:26,268 --> 02:05:28,478
You couldn't ask
for a better night than this.

1472
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:31,439
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.

1473
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:35,693
Ah, there he goes, starting his turn.

1474
02:05:36,445 --> 02:05:38,279
Well, we better get moving.

1475
02:05:40,115 --> 02:05:43,618
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

1476
02:05:47,498 --> 02:05:49,916
- Come along, Eve.
- All right.

1477
02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:55,463
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

1478
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:10,603
We can get out through the window.
There's a car.

1479
02:06:10,771 --> 02:06:12,730
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything.

1480
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:15,817
They know about the shooting.
They're going to do away with you!

1481
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:19,320
- What are you talking about?
- Leonard found the gun in your luggage.

1482
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:22,532
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm.

1483
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:25,618
- That's how he's been getting it.
- Miss Kendall?

1484
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:28,121
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane.

1485
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:38,590
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.

1486
02:06:38,757 --> 02:06:41,759
You and your husband will be
over the Canadian border by morning.

1487
02:06:41,927 --> 02:06:43,678
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Be careful.

1488
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:46,431
We will, sir, and God bless you.

1489
02:07:00,112 --> 02:07:02,196
- Thank you for everything.
- Be careful, now.

1490
02:07:02,364 --> 02:07:05,033
Now, you're not gonna leave
the house until we're...

1491
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:08,286
I'll wait, sir. I certainly will.
Safe journey.

1492
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:11,497
Thank you very much.

1493
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:15,043
Bye.

1494
02:07:51,413 --> 02:07:52,747
Stay where you are.

1495
02:08:04,343 --> 02:08:05,843
Sit down.

1496
02:08:10,224 --> 02:08:13,601
As soon as the plane leaves,
my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.

1497
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:43,297
What is it?

1498
02:08:44,299 --> 02:08:45,967
I was wondering about my earrings.

1499
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:47,927
They'll turn up.

1500
02:08:52,015 --> 02:08:54,892
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister for me.

1501
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,729
And thank her for her superb performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

1502
02:08:57,896 --> 02:09:00,398
- I'll do that.
- Tell your knife-throwing chum...

1503
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:01,846
...that I've reassured his wife.

1504
02:09:01,984 --> 02:09:03,985
- All right.
- That's about all, Leonard.

1505
02:09:20,043 --> 02:09:22,211
Get that figure back from her.

1506
02:09:28,469 --> 02:09:30,178
The housekeeper had me pinned down...

1507
02:09:30,345 --> 02:09:33,014
...before I realized
it was that same silly gun of yours.

1508
02:09:33,182 --> 02:09:35,099
- I see you've got the pumpkin.
- Yes.

1509
02:10:14,139 --> 02:10:16,891
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

1510
02:10:35,327 --> 02:10:37,119
- What do we do?
- Climb down.

1511
02:10:37,287 --> 02:10:38,538
We can't.

1512
02:10:38,705 --> 02:10:40,748
Here they come. We have no choice.

1513
02:11:30,257 --> 02:11:32,216
Well, if we ever get out of this alive...

1514
02:11:32,384 --> 02:11:34,719
...let's go back to New York
on the train together.

1515
02:11:34,887 --> 02:11:36,304
All right?

1516
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:38,389
Is that a proposition?

1517
02:11:39,474 --> 02:11:41,309
It's a proposal, sweetie.

1518
02:11:42,477 --> 02:11:45,187
What happened
to the first two marriages?

1519
02:11:45,814 --> 02:11:47,815
My wives divorced me.

1520
02:11:47,983 --> 02:11:51,027
- Why?
- Well, I think they said I led too dull a life.

1521
02:11:51,194 --> 02:11:53,613
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

1522
02:12:03,999 --> 02:12:05,833
You all right?

1523
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:10,588
All right, all right.

1524
02:12:15,344 --> 02:12:17,219
Okay. Come on.

1525
02:12:17,387 --> 02:12:19,847
Come on. Come up here.

1526
02:12:20,515 --> 02:12:23,309
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1527
02:15:07,349 --> 02:15:10,309
Help. Help me.

1528
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:42,633
Thank you, sergeant.

1529
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:45,845
That wasn't very sporting,
using real bullets?

1530
02:15:46,012 --> 02:15:47,680
Here, reach. Now.

1531
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:51,058
- I'm trying.
- Come on, I've got you.

1532
02:15:51,226 --> 02:15:53,644
- Up.
- I can't make it.

1533
02:15:53,812 --> 02:15:55,521
Yes, you can. Come on.

1534
02:15:55,689 --> 02:15:58,691
- Pull harder.
- Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.

1535
02:16:02,904 --> 02:16:07,408
- Oh. Roger, this is silly.
- I know, but I'm sentimental.
