00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,633
BUT WHEN I LOOKED UP,

328

THE TRAIN WAS BEARING
DOWN ON US...FAST.

329

BUT SOMEHOW I GRABBED HIM,

331
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,709
AND I PUSHED HIM
OUT OF THE BUS.

332
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,210
YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN.

333

YOU COULD'VE
BOTH BEEN KILLED.

00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:01,681
HE'S MY PARTNER.
HE WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME FOR ME.

335

351
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:40,288
THE ONLY THING
