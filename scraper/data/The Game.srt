1
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,860
Financial times, 100 index of 11
points just above the key 3,800 level.

2
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,823
As for the rest of Europe, Frankfurt's
DAX gaining 9 points to 25.32.

3
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,827
In Paris, the CAC-40 losing 7, the
weaker franc weighing on the market.

4
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,969
Thank you, Ilsa.

5
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,013
Have a nice day.

6
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,613
...actually are on time this
morning according to dispatchers.

7
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:51,574
San Francisco's freeways
are...

8
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,007
Good morning, Sir.

9
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:10,093
Well, tell me what
we're supposed to do.

10
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,303
I mean, you may be perched
on majority shares,

11
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:15,139
but we all get fucked
if the actuals crash.

12
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:16,975
That old man
is going to sink us.

13
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,270
Soon as I have Baer-Grant's
P and L report in hand

14
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,021
I will be speed-dialing
your number.

15
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,067
Is that a promise? I'm sorry,
I'm not aware of that term.

16
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,988
Well, what do I do if Anson calls
about substantiation procedure?

17
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,866
Take evasive action. Have your
secretary say you're in a meeting.

18
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,534
Thank you, Jack.

19
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,244
Yes, Maria.
Invitations.

20
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,079
Mmm-hmm.
The museum gala.

21
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,249
No. The Fitzwilliam
botanical annual fundraiser.

22
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,627
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.

23
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,086
Hinchberger wedding.

24
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:49,925
Tuxedos, droning conversations.
I don't think so. No.

25
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,301
I'll send your regrets.

26
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,595
Honestly, why must I bother?

27
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,430
You don't know about society,
Maria.

28
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,392
You don't have the
satisfaction of avoiding it.

29
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,935
Yes.

30
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,271
I have
an Elizabeth on line 3.

31
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,399
Your ex-wife.

32
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,984
I know who it is.

33
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,653
Take a message.

34
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,239
Oh, happy birthday, sir.

35
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:14,867
Thank you, Maggie.

36
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:19,663
I don't like her.

37
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:22,958
I wouldn't even mention the
following, but he was very insistent.

38
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,419
It's obviously some sort of prank. What?

39
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,630
Well, a gentleman called
requesting to have lunch with you.

40
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,758
I tried to assure him that you
were very busy... What's his name?

41
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,635
A Mr. Seymour Butts.

42
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,556
Under the Bleachers
by Seymour Butts.

43
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,642
I'm sorry?

44
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:44,688
Cancel my lunch. Make a reservation at
the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts.

45
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,190
My usual table.

46
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,945
Maria, put the reservation
under my name.

47
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:59,328
You ready to order, sir?
No, I'm still waiting.

48
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,122
This was ice tea.

49
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,589
Conrad, what a surprise.

50
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,257
Happy birthday, Nickie.

51
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,967
Seymour Butts.

52
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,219
I'll never get tired
of that one.

53
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:18,389
That's why it's a classic.
This is a nice restaurant.

54
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,515
They gave me a free jacket.

55
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,476
I'm sure they're gonna
want it back.

56
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,269
I remember being here
a long time ago.

57
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,437
Yeah, I took you here once.

58
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,065
No. I used to buy crystal meth
off the maitre d'.

59
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,191
Oh, really?

60
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,317
In college.

61
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,360
Which college?

62
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:32,153
Touché.

63
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,531
Miss me?

64
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,950
As much as that's possible.

65
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,034
You look good.

66
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,119
So do you.

67
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,328
To think I was worried.

68
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,539
Worried about me?

69
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,625
How long has it been since
Mom's funeral? Two, three years?

70
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:48,420
I thought you quit.

71
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,505
I did.
It didn't take.

72
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:52,215
Well, you can't smoke here.

73
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,050
I'm with you.

74
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,345
It's illegal to smoke
in restaurants in California.

75
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,097
Fuck California.

76
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:01,558
How are you?

77
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,018
Couldn't be better.

78
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,228
Elizabeth?

79
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:08,607
We're divorced. She remarried a
pediatrician or a gynecologist,

80
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,735
or a pediatric gynecologist.
Lives in, uh, Sausalito.

81
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,695
That's too bad.

82
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:15,656
I liked her.

83
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,741
And what about you?

84
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,910
What, you don't keep
track of me anymore?

85
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,787
Not since family week
at rehab.

86
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,915
So what brings you
to town, Conrad?

87
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:26,208
Everything all right?

88
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,293
Yeah.
Need anything?

89
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,753
Nope.
Really?

90
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,381
No I don't need anything
from you. I just

91
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,301
found myself laying naked
on the beach near Ibiza,

92
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,927
and all of a sudden
it clicked.

93
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,470
October 12th.

94
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,306
Nickie's birthday.

95
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:41,765
October 11th.

96
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:43,434
Whatever.

97
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,273
This is for you.

98
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,441
You shouldn't have.

99
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:54,862
What do you get for the man
who has everything?

100
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,535
"Consumer Recreation
Services. "

101
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,245
Well, I do have golf clubs.

102
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:04,789
Call that number.

103
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,582
Why?

104
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,709
It'll make your life fun.

105
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:10,837
Fun?

106
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,422
You know what that is? You've
seen other people have it.

107
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,967
It's an entertainment
service.

108
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,593
An escort service?

109
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:20,847
A profound life experience.

110
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,142
Sorry.
I'll just...

111
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:25,601
No, that's all right.
Just...

112
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:28,479
Tell me you'll call.

113
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,481
I said I would.
No, you didn't.

114
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,319
You still on medication?

115
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,155
Why would you say that?

116
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,740
You gentlemen
ready to order?

117
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,283
I didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

118
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:43,119
I'm not on anything.
I'm not even seeing a shrink.

119
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,913
And I feel great.

120
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,289
Do you mind?

121
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:52,170
I think you'll like this.
I did.

122
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,881
And it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

123
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,841
I'll call them.

124
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,552
Do it. For you.

125
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:01,179
I said I'll call, okay?
All right, I'll call.

126
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,182
It's just that, uh,
I hate surprises.

127
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,309
I know.

128
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:15,402
Happy birthday to you

129
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:19,364
Happy birthday, Mr. Van Orton

130
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,327
Happy birthday to you

131
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:25,954
Thank you.

132
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:32,169
Someone's got to fly to Seattle and
drive a stake through Anson's heart.

133
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,712
Have you seen
the profitability report?

134
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:36,298
You can imagine
how much more unhappy I am.

135
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:38,425
So, you're gonna deal
with Anson? That's correct.

136
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:39,843
We're furious.

137
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,054
Sleep well, Nicholas.

138
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,222
I will.

139
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,367
Good night, Ilsa.

140
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,035
Dinner's in the oven.

141
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:49,247
Thank you.
Oh, I saw Conrad today.

142
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:51,499
Did you? How is he?

143
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,084
He's okay.

144
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,502
I think he's in one of those

145
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,796
personal improvement cults
or something.

146
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:59,174
Well, send my love
if you see him again.

147
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,760
Happy birthday.
Goodnight.

148
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,479
Aw.

149
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,667
...from companies that
defaulted on their payments.

150
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:38,297
The FCC expects to receive
more than $500 million in bids

151
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,883
as the licenses
eagerly soar...

152
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,843
Elizabeth, good evening.

153
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,386
Happy birthday, Nickie.

154
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:45,846
1140.

155
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,639
You almost missed it
this year.

156
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,184
Have you had a nice birthday?

157
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,561
Does Rose Kennedy
have a black dress?

158
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:56,398
I went, not once, but twice
through the spanking machine.

159
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,692
I can only imagine.

160
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,903
How are you?

161
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,780
Connie asked me
the same thing today.

162
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,864
Connie? Really?

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,908
I've always liked
your brother.

164
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,786
Anyway...

165
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,579
I... I just thought

166
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,164
this might be
difficult for you...

167
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,791
Just another birthday.

168
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,836
...because of your father.

169
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,547
That's right.
He was 48, wasn't he?

170
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,049
I hadn't really thought
about it until now.

171
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,635
Why do I call?

172
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,389
I honestly don't know.

173
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,683
Please send Dr. Mel
and Rachel my best.

174
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,227
She has a little brother
on the way.

175
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,438
We did the ultrasound.

176
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,565
Official nuclear family.

177
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,359
You must be very pleased.

178
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,694
We are.

179
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,446
We are very pleased.

180
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,698
Well, it's good
to talk with you.

181
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:48,534
I guess I should let you go.

182
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,411
Take care of yourself.

183
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,247
You too, Nicholas.
I mean that.

184
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,624
I really do.
Uh-huh. Be well. Bye.

185
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:59,963
A proposal to encourage small
businesses to provide their employees

186
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:04,259
with health insurance is now being
debated by Washington legislators.

187
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,137
The bill which attaches a
small-business health plan

188
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,180
to those of
larger corporations

189
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,393
is receiving initial support from
a number of key Republican leaders.

190
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,314
However, Democratic lawmakers
are voicing serious concerns

191
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:21,484
about the bill, claiming that it
would undermine local efforts...

192
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:50,139
I just wanna make sure
that we understand each other.

193
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:54,393
Once you get it down on paper then
you can count on my full support.

194
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,396
We understand that.
Thank you.

195
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:58,605
We'll talk soon.

196
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,354
Well, you shouldn't feel this
reflects negatively on you.

197
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,773
I do feel that
it reflects negatively on me.

198
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,650
I received this...
Just a moment.

199
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,277
I took these tests
in good faith.

200
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,987
I'm sorry you feel that way.

201
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:47,905
I understand.

202
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:50,074
We hope we haven't
caused you any inconvenience.

203
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,201
Thank you
for choosing CRS.

204
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,163
Mr. Feingold, could you
assist this gentleman?

205
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,165
Oh, yeah. Sure.

206
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,460
Jim Feingold,
VP Engineering, Data Analysis.

207
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,004
I don't know exactly how this works.
My brother sent me this card...

208
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,923
Oh, here we go. Yeah.
... as a gift.

209
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,550
All right, excellent.
Well, let's get started.

210
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:11,721
Yeah, I'm sorry about the... You
know, all this hullabaloo here.

211
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:14,432
We're, uh...
Well, we're still moving.

212
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:17,352
I got an office
around here somewhere.

213
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:21,439
You mind holding that?

214
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,484
Thank you very much.

215
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,530
Thank you.

216
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,490
Are you hungry?
New Moon Cafe.

217
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,575
No, thank you.

218
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,076
Next to Chinatown.

219
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,709
A gift from
Conrad Van Orton.

220
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,795
Interesting.
What is?

221
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:46,757
Well, your brother was a
client with our London branch.

222
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:49,176
We do a sort of
informal scoring,

223
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,803
and his numbers
are outstanding.

224
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,180
Really?
Hmm.

225
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:55,098
You sure you're not hungry?
No, thank you.

226
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:58,977
Okay, fine. Now, you need
to fill out these forms.

227
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,896
There's an application

228
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:03,774
and then a couple of psych-tests
there. A MNPI and a PAP.

229
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,984
Oh, uh, for
the financial questionnaire,

230
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,778
don't answer anything
you don't feel like.

231
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:10,030
We'll run our TRW.

232
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:13,701
"I sometimes hurt small
animals, true or false"?

233
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,706
"I feel guilty
when I masturbate. "

234
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,375
Well,
I don't write the questions.

235
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,587
I just review the answers.

236
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,967
What is this for?

237
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,595
Well, to give us an overall
sense of your capability...

238
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,514
No, what is this for?
What are you selling?

239
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:37,850
Oh.

240
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,353
It's a game.
A game?

241
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:43,147
Specifically tailored
for each participant.

242
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:46,776
Think of it as a great vacation.
Except you don't go to it,

243
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:48,528
it comes to you.

244
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,655
What... What kind of vacation?

245
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:53,115
It's different every time.

246
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,826
Humor me with specifics.

247
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,661
We provide

248
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,416
whatever's lacking.

249
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,334
And what if nothing
is lacking?

250
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,836
May I make two suggestions?

251
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,922
You really think that I'll
participate without knowing any...

252
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:11,593
First, admit to yourself
that it sounds intriguing.

253
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,512
Second, you don't have
to decide today.

254
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,723
Take the silly test,
fill out the stupid forms.

255
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:21,186
One day, your game begins. You either
love it or hate it. Decide then.

256
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,897
You know we...
We are like

257
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,026
an experiential
book-of-the-month club.

258
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:31,363
You can drop out at any time
with no further obligation.

259
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,158
That was my sales pitch.

260
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,661
How long will this take?

261
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,288
About an hour for those,
another hour for the physical.

262
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,749
Physical?
It's a cursory examination,

263
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:46,545
turn-your-head, cough sort of thing.
You'll be out of here in no time.

264
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,554
Confused.

265
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,602
Risky.

266
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,774
Bloody.

267
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,697
Whoops.

268
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:17,011
Mr. Sutherland called
about Baer-Grant Publishing.

269
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:18,888
Cancel it.
Push it back till Wednesday.

270
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,641
And Anson Baer called
about tomorrow. Tomorrow?

271
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:23,977
Yes, that's correct. How much
longer is this going to take?

272
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,187
Shouldn't be long.
We're almost done.

273
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,106
You said that two hours ago.

274
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:29,649
All right. Put it back
until tomorrow.

275
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,985
Selection before the
following emotional responses.

276
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,113
You have 0.9 seconds to
enter your emotional response.

277
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,866
Reaction time is a factor.

278
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:43,830
Please make a selection for the
following emotional responses.

279
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:46,666
You have 0.9 seconds to
enter your emotional response.

280
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,838
Does this thing end?

281
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:09,231
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

282
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:12,609
Oh, don't worry. It's been just
terrific spending my entire day

283
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,694
with your crack team.

284
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,362
Well, it's all
down to this.

285
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:18,073
This is an insurance company
requirement. It states that you're aware

286
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:21,326
that the game exists, that you're
a willing participant in said game,

287
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:23,579
so on and so forth. Our
guarantee, payment's entirely

288
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,332
at your brother's discretion as a gift.
It's dependent on your satisfaction.

289
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,710
Does that mean that if I'm not
happy he doesn't have to pay?

290
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,338
That's never happened. We've
never had an unsatisfied customer.

291
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,214
I think you mean,
dissatisfied.

292
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,550
That's right. You're a
left-brained word fetishist.

293
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,345
Initials, initials,
and sign there

294
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:40,512
in blood.

295
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:41,680
Just kidding.

296
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:47,061
All right. Now, your copy will be
at the front desk in this folder.

297
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,063
And I'll... Keep the pen.

298
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,648
We'll let you know.

299
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,444
What about
Monday or Tuesday?

300
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:56,862
No,
that's bad for me.

301
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:57,947
Well,
how about tonight?

302
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:00,324
Well, I'm working
all this evening.

303
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:03,953
Wednesday is the only
possibility right now.

304
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:05,246
Do you wanna do dinner?

305
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:06,789
Okay.

306
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,917
By the way,
I went to CRS.

307
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,086
Really?
What did you think?

308
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:15,131
Well they seemed just a
little bit disorganized.

309
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,259
Well, when I did it in London
they'd been around a while.

310
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,761
Are you gonna do this?

311
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,804
No, I haven't
decided yet.

312
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,561
Telling you, it's like getting in on
the ground floor of the next Disneyland.

313
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:31,856
CRS won't go public.
They're family-owned.

314
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,150
Stranger things
have happened.

315
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,110
No,
they haven't, actually.

316
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:38,530
They opened here.

317
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,532
The game
in San Francisco?

318
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:43,326
See? They're doing fine
without any of us.

319
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,083
Nicholas. How are you?

320
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,626
James, good evening.
Good evening, sir.

321
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,295
We have new members here?

322
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,130
Believe so, sir.

323
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,007
Put their next round on me.

324
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,133
Got you, sir.

325
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,846
No, no, no, no.

326
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:06,767
Last time I played Pebble I swore
I'd never pick up another club again.

327
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,103
Speaking about games...

328
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:13,482
Couldn't help but overhear
you talking about CRS.

329
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:20,364
Well, the reason I mention it is I took the
test today at the Montgomery Street office.

330
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:22,241
You did? Kudos.

331
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,493
So, yours hasn't
started yet?

332
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:28,163
No, not yet. That was one of
the questions I had for you.

333
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:31,125
What is it?
Oh, what is it?

334
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,584
The eternal question.

335
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,837
You know, I envy you.

336
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:39,758
I wish I could go back and do it
for the first time all over again.

337
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:44,972
Here's to new experiences.

338
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,686
Hmm, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go.

339
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,396
Good night, Ted.

340
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:54,273
Nicholas.
Nice to meet you.

341
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:59,653
So, you played recently?

342
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,697
Oh, about a year ago.

343
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:05,034
I was working
in Los Angeles.

344
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:07,953
Oh, I hear the London office
is very good, too...

345
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,415
It sounds like a lot of fantasy,
role-playing nonsense, though.

346
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,544
You wanna know what it is?

347
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,880
What it's all about?

348
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,926
John chapter 0 verse 25.

349
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:23,219
I, um,

350
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:25,596
haven't been to Sunday school
in a long time.

351
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,056
"Whereas once I was blind,

352
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,475
"now I can see. "

353
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,354
Good night, Nicholas.

354
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,356
Best of luck.

355
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,066
Goodnight.

356
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,708
If the Baer-Grant meeting

357
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,754
is not held tomorrow

358
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:01,424
may as well
not be held at all.

359
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,263
When Mr. Van Orton boards
his plane on the morrow

360
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:10,267
he will have every agreement and
addendum in the complete closing package

361
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,893
flawlessly revised.

362
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:15,147
So you will miss another opera
you would have slept during anyway.

363
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:17,941
We now have an opportunity
to show our clients

364
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:21,194
how well we will rise
to his exhilarating challenge.

365
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:25,490
Yes.
Nicholas Van Orton?

366
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,118
Who is this?
This is Cynthia from CRS.

367
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,369
How did you get this number?

368
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,455
We've finished processing
your application.

369
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:32,831
Look, I'm in a meeting
right now.

370
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,666
I'm afraid it was rejected.

371
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,545
I beg your pardon? You shouldn't
feel this reflects negatively on you.

372
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,339
We hope we haven't
caused you any inconvenience.

373
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:43,217
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Thank you for thinking of CRS.

374
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,053
Anything wrong?

375
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,013
Uh, no. No, nothing's...

376
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:54,019
You may hang up or
press pound for more options.

377
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,563
Oh, this is Conrad.
Leave a message.

378
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,985
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas.
Give me a ring when you get in.

379
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:05,114
Oh, uh, regarding
your birthday present,

380
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:07,658
um, things are
a little crazy right now.

381
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:09,368
I don't really know if I can
fit it in my schedule.

382
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,704
But we'll talk about it
at dinner tomorrow.

383
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:13,122
Thanks, bye.

384
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,156
Hello.

385
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,180
...the resulting rise
of unemployment and decline

386
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,432
into buyable small businesses.

387
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:56,268
Meanwhile, Republican leaders
argue that this passage

388
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:59,730
would be the very stimulant
that a sluggish economy needs.

389
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:03,108
No one has expressed an
opinion as to how it will impact

390
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,861
the pampered existence
of Nicholas Van Orton.

391
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:09,615
The one thing on which both Democrats
and Republicans seem to agree

392
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:13,869
is that most Americans harbor serious
doubts about the economic future.

393
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,999
A recent poll suggests a staggering
57% of American workers believe

394
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:24,088
there is a very real chance they will be
unemployed within the next 5 to 7 years.

395
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:28,926
But what does that matter to a
bloated millionaire fat cat like you?

396
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:34,098
In other financial news, stock markets
rose both domestically and abroad today

397
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:36,809
after the announcement of
stronger than expected earnings

398
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,978
by several
high tech companies

399
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:43,608
but dipped again reacting to reports
that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed.

400
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:50,239
Are you gonna spend the rest of the
evening prying at that clown's mouth?

401
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:56,037
I... I don't... It's frustrating
for me if you don't pay attention.

402
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,290
What is this?

403
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:03,503
This is your game, Nicholas,
and welcome to it.

404
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:07,799
I'm here to let you in
on a few ground rules.

405
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:11,261
You received the very first
key, and others will follow.

406
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:15,348
You'll never know where you'll find
them or how you'll need to use them.

407
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:17,267
So keep your eyes open.

408
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,686
How do you...
You can see me?

409
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:22,147
Let us save the questions
till afterwards.

410
00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:25,859
How does this work?

411
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:31,156
There's a tiny camera
looking at you right now.

412
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:35,368
It's impossible.
You're right, impossible.

413
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:39,206
You're having a conversation
with your television.

414
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,668
It's miniaturized.

415
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:48,882
You know how dangerous
that is?

416
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,139
Mr. Van Orton?
And in domestic news,

417
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,225
in Southern California...
Yes, Ilsa. What is it?

418
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,310
Is everything all right?

419
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,603
It's fine. It's...

420
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,231
...in the petroleum
processing plant yesterday.

421
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,192
I've finished for the evening.
Will you be needing anything else?

422
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,778
No, I won't, Ilsa.
Thank you. Good night.

423
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,947
Good night, then.

424
00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:14,533
...in a petroleum processing
plant yesterday.

425
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,828
Several workers were injured
in the... Who was that?

426
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:19,413
Never mind who that is.

427
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:21,999
You wanna know how a camera
got into your home, don't you?

428
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:23,417
Yes, I would.

429
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:32,218
Cold.

430
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,554
Colder.

431
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,394
Warm.

432
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,899
Warmer.

433
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,792
Write this number down.

434
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,338
It's a 24-hour Consumer
Recreation Services hotline.

435
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:09,797
For emergencies only.

436
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:12,800
But don't call asking what
the object of the game is.

437
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,678
Figuring that out
is the object of the game.

438
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:20,558
Good luck and congratulations
on choosing CRS.

439
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,729
...regret to have the American
ambassador expelled after the incident.

440
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:28,525
US State Department responded
quickly with a formal apology.

441
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:32,320
An announcement of the ambassador's
immediate voluntary removal...

442
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,174
Hey, buddy,
spare any change?

443
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:53,842
Help me out here,
huh? Huh?

444
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:12,319
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

445
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,732
May I help you?

446
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,363
What is it?

447
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,534
What?

448
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:51,962
Thank you.

449
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,143
Buddy?

450
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:10,981
Can you help me out?

451
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,027
I need some toilet paper.
I ran out.

452
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,907
Just... Just go into
the next stall.

453
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,994
Come on, help me out.

454
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:26,455
Hello?

455
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,333
Hello?

456
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,965
Didn't expect
to see you here.

457
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,633
I wanted to wish you luck.

458
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,385
Been up all night?

459
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:41,345
I checked it. Personally.

460
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,889
I appreciate that, Sam. Why don't
you go home and get some sleep?

461
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,600
You're sure you don't want
me along? No, I'll be fine.

462
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,519
Hmm, nice shirt.

463
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,396
Don't ask.

464
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,856
Ciao!

465
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,966
All of these years,

466
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:22,011
the first time ever you've
stepped foot in these offices,

467
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,263
it's to ask me to step down.

468
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,641
You promised to
meet the projections, Anson.

469
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:28,935
$1.60 a share
is what you said.

470
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:32,397
I don't think this visit
comes as a surprise.

471
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,357
Projections were
far too optimistic.

472
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:35,608
Admittedly, yes.

473
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,361
Our EPS was 150 last
quarter. We're up 6 cents...

474
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:42,407
The expectations were 10, and in this
case the expectations meant everything.

475
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:45,660
Will you really
hold me to it over pennies?

476
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:48,121
My stock is falling.
I don't know about yours.

477
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:51,124
Those pennies are costing
millions. Give me...

478
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:52,917
Give me next quarter.

479
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,003
If you still feel this way,
vote your shares...

480
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:56,755
Today is what counts, Anson.

481
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:01,218
You...

482
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,221
You intractable
son of a bitch.

483
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:06,598
If your father
could see you now.

484
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:08,892
What?
Your father was a friend.

485
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:11,937
A friend! God damn it.
I've watched you grow up.

486
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:15,983
Because you went fishing with my
father I should sit on my hands

487
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,734
while you're throwing
my money away?

488
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:19,528
I will tell you...
I'm not finished.

489
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:22,698
Now, you misspoke before when
you said you're stepping down.

490
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:25,951
I am firing you.

491
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,705
Action is taken.
Confidence is restored.

492
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:32,249
The stock goes up.
No.

493
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:35,961
There's
no Baer-Grant Publishing...

494
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:40,341
No Baer-Grant Publishing
without Anson Baer.

495
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:43,886
Where's Stewart Grant? He's
probably out there sailing

496
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:47,139
enjoying his golden years wondering
where the hell you are, Anson.

497
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,642
I'm sorry.

498
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:51,977
You failed.

499
00:35:56,106 --> 00:36:00,444
I have prepared a severance
package that is more than

500
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:01,695
equitable.

501
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,282
Valid until this evening.

502
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:09,412
I could fight you on this.

503
00:36:10,162 --> 00:36:12,498
If I leave
without your signature,

504
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:15,668
this agreement begins
to disintegrate.

505
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,629
Benefits shrink,
options narrow

506
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:22,049
and your compensation
will be shriveled.

507
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,557
I think it's in your

508
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:31,601
best interest, Anson, to...

509
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:49,536
Well, I guess this is your

510
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,913
lucky day.

511
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:55,250
My lawyers will be
in touch with you.

512
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,578
Excuse me. Has Conrad
Van Orton left a message?

513
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,247
I'll check on it right away,
Mr. Van Orton.

514
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:34,498
Thank you.

515
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:43,507
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Here.

516
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:45,509
Please, don't do that.

517
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:47,511
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't even looking.

518
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,513
I'm really having
a bad day.

519
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:50,764
How about a bad month?

520
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:54,101
You did almost exactly the same
thing to me when I was here last week.

521
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:55,603
Here.
Don't do that.

522
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:58,981
Just get me some napkins
and some soda water.

523
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,816
Looks like the, uh,

524
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,777
cleaning bill's gonna be
more than the suit.

525
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,779
I don't think so.

526
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,325
It was an accident, sir.
Terrific.

527
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:11,243
I said I was sorry.

528
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,124
Asshole.
Christine!

529
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:18,834
Mr. Van Orton is
a valued customer.

530
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,586
Fine.
Then you kiss his ass.

531
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:22,505
Don't you talk to me
like that.

532
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,673
I apologized,

533
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,258
I offered to help.
What do you want me to do?

534
00:38:25,258 --> 00:38:26,467
Clean out your locker.

535
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:28,135
What?
You heard me.

536
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:34,142
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Van Orton.

537
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,476
If you're not
too uncomfortable,

538
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:37,687
will this table suit you
for a complimentary meal?

539
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:38,980
It'll be fine.

540
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:48,281
I'll fetch your waiter.

541
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,407
Thank you.

542
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:52,243
Check, sir.

543
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,768
Fucking lamb vichyssoise,
you little...

544
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:19,187
Miss. Pardon me, miss.

545
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:20,689
Oh, great. It's you.

546
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:25,152
I don't know how this works,
but do you have something for me?

547
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:26,403
I, uh...

548
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,656
I received this note...

549
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:31,366
What're you babbling about,
psycho?

550
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,618
I need to know
what is going on.

551
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:34,870
You wanna know
what's going on?

552
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,999
I'm going on my second job this month. Now
it looks like I'm going on unemployment.

553
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,251
Maybe I should
try to explain...

554
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,837
Don't explain,
just fuck off.

555
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:48,675
Son of a bitch!

556
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:52,638
I am... I'm trying to...
I'm apologizing. I...

557
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,986
Jesus, what is this?

558
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:13,701
What's with him? I don't
know, he just... He fell down.

559
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:14,910
Can you hear me?

560
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,872
Do you know what to do? I don't
even know if he's breathing.

561
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:18,873
Here you are.

562
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,916
Move your head.

563
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,544
Don't stand there.
Get help.

564
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:25,963
Hey, hey. It's okay.

565
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:27,882
We're gonna get help.

566
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:30,384
How do we know he's real?

567
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:34,263
He's pissed his pants, mister.
Is that real enough for you?

568
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:35,890
Oh, good God.

569
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,975
He's turning blue.

570
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,102
Police! Police!

571
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:52,949
You will have to
fill these forms out.

572
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:54,534
I don't know this man.

573
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:56,494
Here, what do you need? Can't
get involved in this shit.

574
00:40:56,494 --> 00:40:58,788
Hey, I might have to
detain you. Detain me?

575
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:00,290
The report's gotta
be filled out.

576
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,000
She can do the reports.

577
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,459
Ride with your wife.
We'll meet at the hospital.

578
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,503
The hospital?
Two blocks away.

579
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:06,963
She's not my wife.

580
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:09,507
Let's go.

581
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:14,721
This is insane.

582
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:17,807
10 minutes ago, I'm about to
enjoy a quiet little dinner.

583
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,934
I received this note...

584
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,649
He's breathing, isn't he?
Yes.

585
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,276
Is the siren
entirely necessary?

586
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:45,502
Let's just talk to someone who
can get this over with, shall we?

587
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,878
Hang on.

588
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,507
They need
your driver's license number.

589
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,815
Oh, no.
You've got to be kidding.

590
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,151
What is happening?

591
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,528
This was what I was trying to
explain to you. This is a...

592
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:12,988
A game.

593
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,616
A what?
It's a company.

594
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,077
They plan elaborate pranks.
Things like this.

595
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,329
I don't really
understand it myself.

596
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,208
What are you talking about?
This is a...

597
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,378
The lights, they went out.
A hundred people ran away.

598
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,717
What, so you mean the guy who just
pissed himself and turned blue was...

599
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,427
Sorry about that.

600
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,096
You should be.

601
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,394
Why're they involving you?

602
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,855
There's gotta be a...

603
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,442
A flashlight.

604
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,110
Oh, great.

605
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,535
I thought that guy was going to
die. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

606
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,704
I'll see you around.

607
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,042
How do you know
that's the way?

608
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,502
I don't.

609
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,976
Where did you all go,
you motherfucking frat boys?

610
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,646
You'd better hide.

611
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,293
Lobby?

612
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:36,509
My brother got me this gift
certificate to this company...

613
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,970
Why, I got the key
out of this...

614
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,223
Out of the mouth
of this

615
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,350
wooden clown.

616
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,811
Never mind.

617
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:53,109
I can't take this.

618
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,202
There's no signal.

619
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,914
What is the going rate for a
trapped-in-elevator adventure?

620
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:10,710
Well, don't even
think about it.

621
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,545
Why not?
Read what the sign says.

622
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:15,715
"Warning, do not attempt to
open if the elevator stops.

623
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:17,091
"Use emergency... "

624
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:18,259
Phone?
"... phone. "

625
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:20,762
If there was one.
We'll wait for help, so...

626
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,348
Let's just wait for help.

627
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,193
Okay, I'll give
you a boost.

628
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:36,736
You get up,
you go first.

629
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:38,905
This is not an attempt
to be gallant.

630
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:41,074
If I don't lift you how are
you going to get up there?

631
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:43,451
I don't know,
you'll pull me up.

632
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:45,537
It's easier my way.
Come on, step up.

633
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,247
No.
Oh, please.

634
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,958
I'm not wearing
any underwear.

635
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,836
Okay. There I said it.

636
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,217
Okay.

637
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,277
We can use this
like a ladder.

638
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,904
My hero, let's go.

639
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,826
I don't think so.

640
00:46:26,412 --> 00:46:27,788
Thank you.

641
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:38,173
Damn it! My briefcase!

642
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,387
I'll wait.

643
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,265
Not as if anybody
could open it.

644
00:46:54,357 --> 00:46:56,692
Wait a minute.
This is CRS.

645
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,028
What's CRS? This is the
company I was telling you about.

646
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:01,572
The one that gave me
the gift certificate.

647
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:04,116
This is their building.

648
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:14,127
We'll wait. We'll wait
for security to come

649
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:15,920
and we'll just explain.

650
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,840
They'll love that!
Explain for both of us!

651
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:22,760
Wait!

652
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:40,570
We don't wanna
draw any attention...

653
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,322
Just out for a stroll.
Run!

654
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:49,663
We can't fit down there!

655
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:58,421
Are you trying to ditch me?
Hey!

656
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,923
You're a grown man.
I'm not responsible for...

657
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,758
I'm not the one
who started running.

658
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:04,136
Well I'm not the one
that started this...

659
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:23,655
Get up there!
I'm going!

660
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:27,034
Here.

661
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:30,245
Climb.

662
00:48:39,672 --> 00:48:42,591
So, where's your modesty
around attack dogs?

663
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:55,896
Hey! Shut up!
Stupid fucking dogs.

664
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,695
Let me guess.
I go first.

665
00:49:14,457 --> 00:49:16,626
There goes a thousand dollars.

666
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:18,461
Your shoes cost
a thousand dollars?

667
00:49:18,878 --> 00:49:20,379
That one did.

668
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:28,262
Here. Come on.

669
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,182
Here you go.
Okay.

670
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,310
Watch out for nails

671
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,269
and rats.

672
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:36,771
What?

673
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:39,190
There should be
a fire escape.

674
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:01,796
Yeah, it's classic.

675
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:04,549
Why me?

676
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:10,138
Who are you?

677
00:50:11,264 --> 00:50:13,141
Nicholas Van Orton.

678
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:16,228
What are you,
a czar or something?

679
00:50:17,187 --> 00:50:18,563
All right.

680
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:20,732
I think

681
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:22,275
if we

682
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:24,027
drop from here,

683
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:26,238
the garbage
will break our fall.

684
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:29,366
I think not.
Be careful!

685
00:50:34,621 --> 00:50:36,665
What the fuck
are you looking at?

686
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,000
Oh...

687
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,668
Shit.

688
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:07,196
Table for two, please.

689
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:14,745
Where're we going?

690
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:16,455
That tall bright building.

691
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:18,291
It's right near there.

692
00:51:23,629 --> 00:51:25,631
Everything okay, miss?

693
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:27,425
Yeah.

694
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:29,343
How are you doing?

695
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:32,096
San Francisco's finest.

696
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:45,860
Is there some place
I could throw this?

697
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:49,614
There's a wastebasket
beside the desk.

698
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:51,658
Oh.

699
00:51:51,658 --> 00:51:54,744
Think I have a fresh
sweatshirt for you somewhere.

700
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,789
That would be great.

701
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:05,004
You know, you've never even
asked me my name.

702
00:52:05,004 --> 00:52:08,216
The maitre d' said
your name was Christine.

703
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:10,260
Oh, right.

704
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,847
I guess I'll call you a cab.

705
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,978
You got a shower
in your office?

706
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:21,229
Yeah.

707
00:52:21,229 --> 00:52:23,356
You an athlete or something?

708
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:26,359
No, I'm an investment banker.

709
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:29,821
I move money from
one place to another.

710
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:37,162
Actually, would you mind
if I just quickly rinsed off?

711
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:39,498
No.

712
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,335
Is there a towel I could use?

713
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:45,754
Yeah, it's behind the door.

714
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:49,049
Oh, I'll just be a second.
No problem.

715
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:55,013
Listen, I know the owner of
the City Club and I'd be happy

716
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,474
to give him a call
if you'd like.

717
00:52:57,725 --> 00:53:00,686
Don't, it was a shitty
job anyway. I overreacted.

718
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,022
I, uh...

719
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,692
I have a confession to make.

720
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:13,115
Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill
drinks on you as a practical joke.

721
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,492
Really?

722
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:15,868
And what did they say?

723
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:17,578
Well they said 300.
I said 4.

724
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:21,373
They said, "The guy in the gray flannel
suit. " I think I said, "The, uh,

725
00:53:21,707 --> 00:53:24,377
"attractive guy in
the gray flannel suit?"

726
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:52,155
Mr. Van Orton. I was afraid you
weren't going to make it back.

727
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:54,657
Thank you.

728
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:03,583
Hello.
Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria.

729
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,876
I thought I should call.

730
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:06,044
What time is it?

731
00:54:06,044 --> 00:54:07,712
It's 11:00.

732
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:10,590
I took the liberty of rescheduling
your meeting with Alison and...

733
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,218
No, no, no.
I'll be in there in an hour.

734
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:17,847
Can you... I left my briefcase
at 1010 Montgomery Street.

735
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:20,141
Could you check with
Lost and Found, please?

736
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:22,602
Anson Baer's in town at
the Ritz Carlton. Really?

737
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:23,937
He's requesting
dinner tonight.

738
00:54:23,937 --> 00:54:25,647
Well, we'll see about that.

739
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:27,732
And the Hotel Nikko
called to say

740
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,610
they have your American
Express card at the front desk.

741
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,946
You left it there last night?

742
00:54:33,655 --> 00:54:35,949
Should I send someone?
No, just give me the number.

743
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:38,577
555-1111.
I'll call you back.

744
00:54:43,623 --> 00:54:44,791
Good morning,
Hotel Nikko.

745
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:48,253
Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton. I'm
told you have my American Express card.

746
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,380
Yes, Mr. Van Orton
everything's in order.

747
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,883
The concierges has arranged for
the wine and flowers in the room.

748
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:55,219
Has he?
And a young woman phoned

749
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:58,096
to say she's on route
but running a little late.

750
00:54:58,096 --> 00:55:00,474
Did the young woman
leave her name?

751
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:03,644
I'm sure I don't know.

752
00:55:03,644 --> 00:55:05,479
Of course you don't.
Thank you.

753
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:18,367
Sorry, my fault.

754
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:27,168
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.

755
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:28,544
Welcome back.

756
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,421
Here we go.

757
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:33,674
Have we met?

758
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:36,218
I believe so.

759
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:43,309
If you'll just sign here
on the signature card.

760
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:52,110
Thank you.

761
00:55:56,823 --> 00:55:58,157
My key?

762
00:55:59,033 --> 00:55:59,992
Huh?

763
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,245
Don't I get a key?

764
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:05,873
Didn't I give you one
last night?

765
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:07,584
No, I don't think so.

766
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:13,214
Cute, that's very cute.

767
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:15,258
This way, sir.

768
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:17,010
Have a nice day.

769
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:00,072
Housekeeping.

770
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,416
Could you come back
a little later?

771
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,693
Ah!

772
00:58:37,193 --> 00:58:38,236
Shit.

773
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:13,772
Thank you, sir.

774
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,347
Where the fuck is he?

775
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:30,433
Jesus!
Why are you following me?

776
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:31,809
What are you talking about?

777
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:34,270
I'm not following you.
I'm just driving it.

778
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,396
Hey,

779
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:38,399
whatever I'm doing is none of your
business. Is Anson Baer the game?

780
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,984
Is that what
this is all about?

781
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:42,779
Look buddy, back off.
Just back off, huh?

782
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:43,905
What!

783
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:47,075
Oh, that's cute.
That's really cute.

784
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:49,828
I suppose the game
uses real bullets, huh?

785
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:57,377
All right.
I'm a private investigator.

786
01:00:57,377 --> 01:00:59,796
Somebody hired me to
keep tabs on you. Who?

787
01:00:59,796 --> 01:01:01,798
Who hired you?
Who hired you?

788
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,061
Mr. Van Orton...
Maria, get hold of Sutherland.

789
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:16,980
Have him meet me at the
Ritz Carlton. I'm on my way.

790
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:31,286
What's happening?
Follow me, Sam.

791
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:40,212
Ah, Nicholas!

792
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:41,922
It's unexpected.

793
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:48,554
Now, do you really believe

794
01:01:48,554 --> 01:01:51,307
that just because
you publish children's books

795
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:53,476
people are gonna care
about my reputation?

796
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,227
You can have pictures of me

797
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:58,189
wearing nipple rings,
butt-fucking Captain Kangaroo.

798
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:00,608
The only thing they care about
is the stock!

799
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:03,069
And whether that stock
is up or down.

800
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:04,278
Daddy? It's all right,
dear. It's all right.

801
01:02:04,278 --> 01:02:08,616
And the fact that you bring
Conrad into this juvenile game

802
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:10,868
is unconscionable.

803
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,914
Are you finished?
No! I'm not finished!

804
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:18,042
I'd like you to meet my
attorney, Samuel Sutherland.

805
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:20,586
I think the two of you have
got something to talk about.

806
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:22,755
Oh, we met this morning.

807
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:25,883
I signed the termination
contract for Baer-Grant.

808
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,469
I accepted your settlement,
Nicholas.

809
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:32,682
You were right. I'm going
sailing. You know, sailing.

810
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:39,105
You're welcome to join our lunch.
Maybe we can straighten this out.

811
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:44,110
You remember my wife, Mary Carol,
and my daughter-in-law, Kaleigh.

812
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:53,203
Please

813
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:55,789
accept my

814
01:02:57,332 --> 01:02:59,000
misguided, uh...

815
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:13,431
How concerned should I be?

816
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:15,308
It was a misunderstanding.

817
01:03:16,977 --> 01:03:18,812
It looks a lot like you.

818
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:22,983
Well, you should see what
they do with the nightly news.

819
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:24,067
What?

820
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,902
Can I ask you
to do me a favor?

821
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,404
You know you can.

822
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:31,450
Find out about a company called
Consumer Recreation Services.

823
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,828
Sounds like they make
tennis rackets.

824
01:03:34,995 --> 01:03:36,538
What do you know?

825
01:03:38,165 --> 01:03:40,459
Wait a minute.
They gave me a waiver.

826
01:03:55,516 --> 01:03:57,851
What is this?
It's a...

827
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,021
What's...

828
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:05,651
I don't believe it.
It's invisible ink.

829
01:04:06,026 --> 01:04:08,738
You're joking. This is what I'm
dealing with. I'm being toyed with

830
01:04:08,738 --> 01:04:11,407
by a bunch
of depraved children. This...

831
01:04:13,868 --> 01:04:15,244
Are you okay?

832
01:04:16,203 --> 01:04:18,039
Tell me not to worry.

833
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,084
You don't have to worry.

834
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:23,753
I promise.

835
01:04:24,045 --> 01:04:25,004
Okay.

836
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:29,133
I'll call you later.

837
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:31,844
Right. Okay, bye.

838
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:37,683
Maria, the other night,
last night

839
01:04:38,434 --> 01:04:40,728
I got a taxi for a young
woman named Christine.

840
01:04:40,728 --> 01:04:42,230
What's the company
that we use?

841
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,065
United?
What?

842
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:46,192
United Taxi Company.
United Taxi Company.

843
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:49,320
Call United,
find out who the driver was

844
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,489
and where they took her.

845
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:20,852
Ilsa!

846
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:23,730
Oh, shit!

847
01:05:55,345 --> 01:05:56,805
I have a gun!

848
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:13,133
You fuckers.

849
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:19,014
Ilsa.

850
01:07:19,889 --> 01:07:21,016
Ilsa. Ilsa.

851
01:07:21,016 --> 01:07:22,517
Mr. Van Orton!
Are you all right?

852
01:07:22,517 --> 01:07:23,518
What do you mean?
What's happened?

853
01:07:23,518 --> 01:07:24,895
The house,
you haven't seen the house?

854
01:07:24,936 --> 01:07:26,187
What's wrong?

855
01:07:26,187 --> 01:07:27,647
There's been a break in.
Now, lock your door.

856
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,066
Stay inside, just lock
your door. Oh, be careful.

857
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:39,242
911 emergency.
Yes, I need the police.

858
01:07:39,242 --> 01:07:40,869
There's been a break in
to my house.

859
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,080
Just stay on the line
and give me your address.

860
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,415
My address is 2210 Broadway.

861
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:47,417
It's the biggest house
on the street.

862
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:48,919
Now sir, you said
it was a break in?

863
01:07:48,919 --> 01:07:50,754
Yes. Yes,
there's been a break in.

864
01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:52,714
Are you sure they're gone?

865
01:07:53,131 --> 01:07:54,216
What?

866
01:07:54,424 --> 01:07:57,678
Are you sure there's not still
someone somewhere in the house?

867
01:07:59,388 --> 01:08:00,597
Nickie!

868
01:08:00,597 --> 01:08:02,182
Hello, sir?
Are you still there?

869
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:04,059
Meet me at your car.
Hello?

870
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:06,395
Sir?

871
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:17,156
All right. What happened? Shh!

872
01:08:18,282 --> 01:08:20,618
Conrad, where're we going?
Just wait!

873
01:08:25,498 --> 01:08:27,166
What are you doing?

874
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,334
They're methodical.

875
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:30,461
If I can't trust the
room service in the hotel,

876
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:31,962
I sure as hell can't
trust a fucking car.

877
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:34,131
Who?
CRS. Who do you think!

878
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:36,467
Jesus! When I think what
I almost got you into...

879
01:08:36,592 --> 01:08:38,094
What are you saying?

880
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:39,470
Oh, I'm so fucked.

881
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:42,807
They just fuck you and they
fuck you and they fuck you!

882
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:45,935
And just when you think it's all over
that's when the real fucking starts!

883
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:48,563
All right, calm down.
Just take a breath.

884
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:53,317
They won't stop, Nick.

885
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:56,779
I paid the bill. I gave
them their fucking money.

886
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:58,322
They won't leave me alone!

887
01:08:58,322 --> 01:08:59,490
What're they doing to you?

888
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,826
Everything!
I'm a goddamned human piñata.

889
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:02,910
Calm down!

890
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,580
And why do they keep playing if
you've already paid? I don't know.

891
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,499
I don't know. I paid
them more to make it stop!

892
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:22,222
They did this.

893
01:09:22,222 --> 01:09:23,556
It's a flat tire.

894
01:09:23,556 --> 01:09:24,641
How do you know?

895
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,810
Get a grip on yourself,
will you? We'll figure it out!

896
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,269
Okay, okay.

897
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,575
The phone doesn't work. I
can't get a signal. Really?

898
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:44,119
You know how to
change a tire?

899
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:45,162
No, don't you?

900
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:48,874
It can't be that hard. I don't think
we should be out in the open like this.

901
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:51,835
Hit the Teletrack.
It's in the glove compartment.

902
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:13,023
You're with them.

903
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:15,401
What?

904
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:18,028
You're doing this.
You're part of it.

905
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:22,241
Whose are these?

906
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:26,036
I don't know about those.
Somebody put them in the car.

907
01:10:26,036 --> 01:10:27,830
You're behind the whole thing,
aren't you?

908
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,082
What are you talking about?
You brought them to me.

909
01:10:30,082 --> 01:10:31,876
These were in your car!

910
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:34,879
They're right there
in your fucking car!

911
01:10:34,879 --> 01:10:36,088
Conrad!

912
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:43,012
Listen to what you're saying.

913
01:10:43,012 --> 01:10:45,389
No! You're not gonna
control this conversation.

914
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,266
Why would I ever do
what you're describing?

915
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:49,560
Because you resent me.
Stop being emotional.

916
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,938
It kills you that
I'm living my life.

917
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:53,231
Lower your voice, Conrad!

918
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,816
What? You're afraid somebody's
gonna witness the scene?

919
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:57,485
Get back in your... Get back
in your fucking house!

920
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:59,320
Will you stop it?
I'm calling the cops.

921
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,988
You're just so afraid
that somebody's gonna see

922
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:03,658
what a manipulative
fucking control freak you are!

923
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:04,951
What is wrong with you?
What are you on?

924
01:11:04,951 --> 01:11:06,619
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

925
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:09,080
I'm sorry I didn't
live up to your expectations.

926
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,164
Ah, bullshit!

927
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:12,625
I'm not you. I'll never be
you. I don't wanna be you.

928
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:13,668
There you go again!

929
01:11:13,668 --> 01:11:14,836
I'm your brother!

930
01:11:14,836 --> 01:11:16,796
Always pushing the
responsibility out on me.

931
01:11:16,796 --> 01:11:18,506
For Christ's sakes,
I'm your brother!

932
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:20,174
All I ever tried
to do was help you.

933
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:21,551
I don't want your help!

934
01:11:21,551 --> 01:11:23,469
Nobody asked you
to play dad!

935
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:25,138
No! You don't say that.

936
01:11:25,138 --> 01:11:28,433
Did I have a choice?

937
01:11:34,522 --> 01:11:35,523
Jackass!

938
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,329
Conrad!

939
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:23,697
What?

940
01:12:23,864 --> 01:12:25,532
I don't want your help!

941
01:12:25,532 --> 01:12:26,533
Nobody asked you
to play dad!

942
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:29,161
Did I have a choice?
Did I have a choice?

943
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,599
Taxi!

944
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,940
2210 Broadway.

945
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:26,886
Hey buddy,
you missed the turn.

946
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:30,557
Hey! Did you hear me?

947
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,560
You missed the turn back...

948
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:37,814
No, no, no. Stop the car!

949
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:39,315
Stop the car!

950
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,071
Thank you.

951
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:47,115
Open the door.

952
01:13:47,115 --> 01:13:48,199
Unlock the door.

953
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,744
Open, the goddamn door!

954
01:13:58,793 --> 01:13:59,920
Listen.

955
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,006
I am a very wealthy man.

956
01:14:04,132 --> 01:14:06,093
And whatever
they're paying you

957
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:07,886
I'll double it.

958
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:13,058
Oh, Jesus Christ!

959
01:14:34,413 --> 01:14:35,414
What!

960
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:37,499
No!

961
01:14:59,146 --> 01:15:00,981
What, are you out of
your fucking mind?

962
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,668
It's a game.

963
01:16:03,545 --> 01:16:05,005
Here they are.

964
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:10,760
Detective,
I'm Sam Sutherland.

965
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,471
Tim Foley.

966
01:16:13,597 --> 01:16:14,973
You know where we're going?

967
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:16,391
It's this way.

968
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:17,726
14th floor.

969
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:38,163
Okay.

970
01:16:38,163 --> 01:16:42,042
Management for the building says this
space hasn't been officially rented yet.

971
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:45,462
The county recorder has
no listing for a Consumer

972
01:16:45,462 --> 01:16:48,507
Recreation Service
or any derivation thereof.

973
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:50,801
The divers, they're
still looking for the cab.

974
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:53,554
As soon as they find it they'll
pull the plates and the VIN.

975
01:16:53,554 --> 01:16:54,888
Have you spoken
to your brother?

976
01:16:55,055 --> 01:16:57,474
He hasn't called me back yet.
No.

977
01:16:57,933 --> 01:16:59,101
What about the house?

978
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:02,480
The graffiti was an oil-based
marine marking solution,

979
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,772
illegal in the States.

980
01:17:03,772 --> 01:17:06,567
It's not impossible to trace
but it'll take time.

981
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:08,444
The photo,
the gun,

982
01:17:08,694 --> 01:17:10,780
the clown,
the ambulance.

983
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:13,699
It's all pending.

984
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:15,743
Breaking and entering
we've got solid.

985
01:17:16,118 --> 01:17:19,664
Malicious mischief, vandalism,
harassment. But that's all.

986
01:17:19,664 --> 01:17:22,124
Illegal surveillance.
Reckless endangerment.

987
01:17:22,124 --> 01:17:23,292
Attempted murder.

988
01:17:24,835 --> 01:17:27,505
Except you said you
hired these guys.

989
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:29,507
That's irrelevant.
Now, look.

990
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:32,093
It's our job to tell you
what we've got.

991
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:34,429
So far, we don't have motive.

992
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,441
What was my father like,
Ilsa?

993
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:48,151
Why do you ask?

994
01:17:48,776 --> 01:17:50,236
I don't know.

995
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:54,574
All the time I've known you
you've never once asked about him.

996
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,871
I guess
he was just on my mind.

997
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:02,707
Your mother loved your father very much.

998
01:18:02,916 --> 01:18:05,168
I think he just
worked too hard.

999
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,337
Was he, uh,

1000
01:18:08,338 --> 01:18:10,131
morose? I mean...

1001
01:18:10,882 --> 01:18:12,592
What I remember most

1002
01:18:12,592 --> 01:18:14,594
was that his manner was so

1003
01:18:15,136 --> 01:18:16,304
slight.

1004
01:18:17,138 --> 01:18:19,558
You could spend time
in a room

1005
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:21,810
and not even know that he'd
been there the whole time.

1006
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,812
No, what I mean is,

1007
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:26,314
before he...

1008
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,774
What happened? No.

1009
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:29,985
Nobody expected it.

1010
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:33,405
I wonder how much of him
there is in me.

1011
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,366
Not much, I think.

1012
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,705
Was Mother worried about him?

1013
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:44,750
Nobody ever worried
about your father.

1014
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:50,672
Yes.

1015
01:18:50,672 --> 01:18:53,050
It's Maria. I found the address
you wanted from United Taxi.

1016
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,385
Yeah, give it to me.

1017
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:55,844
It's on Potrero Hill...

1018
01:19:57,115 --> 01:19:58,449
Who are you?

1019
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,995
Christine, is she here?

1020
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,746
She's sleeping.

1021
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,999
Amy, who is it?

1022
01:20:08,168 --> 01:20:10,003
Hey!
What're you doing here?

1023
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:11,296
Can we talk?

1024
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:13,339
Sure.

1025
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:19,054
Hi.
Hi.

1026
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:24,851
Didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1027
01:20:25,227 --> 01:20:27,479
What can you tell me
about these?

1028
01:20:28,104 --> 01:20:29,523
Is this you?

1029
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:32,359
Where did you get them?

1030
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:33,860
My hotel room.

1031
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:37,823
Was in my hotel room. Are you
telling me that this is not you?

1032
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:41,284
What makes you, um...

1033
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:45,038
Think this is me?
Well, the...

1034
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:47,332
The bra. The red bra.

1035
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:49,251
Okay.

1036
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:51,879
Well, I thought that...

1037
01:20:56,425 --> 01:20:58,302
Can I sit down for a minute?

1038
01:20:58,552 --> 01:20:59,803
Sure.

1039
01:21:00,846 --> 01:21:02,431
Are you all right?

1040
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:06,685
You're not all right, are you?

1041
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:10,522
Is it this contest thing
that you're in still or...

1042
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:14,318
I'm sorry, I am being
a nuisance. I should go.

1043
01:21:14,318 --> 01:21:17,905
No, it's okay. We can talk. I'll put
some clothes on. I'll be right back.

1044
01:21:24,286 --> 01:21:26,455
Do you have an aspirin?

1045
01:23:17,317 --> 01:23:19,445
Can I get you something
to drink with this?

1046
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:20,779
Is this you?

1047
01:23:21,488 --> 01:23:23,866
Oh, yeah.
That's first communion.

1048
01:23:25,576 --> 01:23:26,994
Show it to me.

1049
01:23:27,578 --> 01:23:30,831
What's wrong? Take the
picture out of the frame

1050
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:32,708
and show it to me.

1051
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,627
All right.

1052
01:23:37,171 --> 01:23:38,339
They're watching.

1053
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:40,758
What?
Not here.

1054
01:23:40,966 --> 01:23:42,885
They can see here.

1055
01:23:44,011 --> 01:23:45,680
Smoke detector.

1056
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:51,602
What do you say, uh...

1057
01:23:52,436 --> 01:23:54,647
Let's go for a drive
or something. We could...

1058
01:23:54,647 --> 01:23:58,985
No, no, no. I am tired of this.
I am goddamn tired of this.

1059
01:23:58,985 --> 01:24:00,570
We'll go for a drink.
There's a...

1060
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,155
Who do you people
think you are?

1061
01:24:02,155 --> 01:24:05,241
Who do you think you are?
Come on out of there!

1062
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:06,993
Nicholas, please.
Let's go, right now.

1063
01:24:06,993 --> 01:24:09,370
Come on. Just, come on
out of there right now!

1064
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:19,088
Now you've done it.

1065
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:39,442
So, what are they
going to do?

1066
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,194
Get away from the window.

1067
01:25:10,891 --> 01:25:11,892
What the...

1068
01:25:20,901 --> 01:25:22,027
What is this?

1069
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:23,862
Wake up,
it's a fucking con.

1070
01:26:05,321 --> 01:26:07,031
Get in, get in!

1071
01:26:29,137 --> 01:26:31,055
You all right?
Hold on.

1072
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:54,913
Get out of the car.

1073
01:26:54,913 --> 01:26:56,706
I could've handed you to them.
And they find me now they...

1074
01:26:56,706 --> 01:26:58,875
Get out of the goddamn car!

1075
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:00,001
You don't have a choice!

1076
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:02,587
No one else's gonna tell you
what's going on!

1077
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:21,148
You wanna know? 'Cause if
I'm gone you never will.

1078
01:27:34,536 --> 01:27:38,332
I can't believe they didn't even take
the time to get the fucking house right.

1079
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:39,458
Who are they?

1080
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:41,251
I don't know. Nobody
does. I'm an employee.

1081
01:27:41,251 --> 01:27:43,420
Then what good are you? I know
things like who you can trust

1082
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:45,422
and that your brother was in it
from beginning... That's a lie.

1083
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:46,799
Yeah? I was your waitress
on your birthday.

1084
01:27:46,799 --> 01:27:50,219
Connie told you about CRS that
day. Ever seen me in there before?

1085
01:27:51,262 --> 01:27:52,596
Sorry.

1086
01:27:52,888 --> 01:27:56,434
I mean, it wasn't his fault. I guess
he thought it was his only way out.

1087
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:57,893
They fleeced him
real good.

1088
01:27:57,893 --> 01:27:59,562
How did they get to him?

1089
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:01,480
Same thing to him
they did to you.

1090
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,232
What are you talking about?

1091
01:28:03,232 --> 01:28:05,109
Have you checked
your accounts?

1092
01:28:06,027 --> 01:28:08,529
That night in your office I got the
number to your private line and modem

1093
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:11,365
that gave CRS remote access
to your computer.

1094
01:28:11,657 --> 01:28:13,492
You gave them
everything else.

1095
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:14,702
What?

1096
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:17,079
You took their tests, handwriting,
voice samples, psych info.

1097
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:19,874
They used it all
to figure out your passwords.

1098
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:23,878
And Feingold,
the guy who signed you up,

1099
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:26,255
he did 5 years
for hacking Citibank.

1100
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:28,299
They only had to
keep you distracted

1101
01:28:28,299 --> 01:28:29,842
while they broke
into your financial network,

1102
01:28:29,842 --> 01:28:31,678
transferred your holdings
into dummy accounts...

1103
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:33,638
Overseas operator, please.

1104
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,140
Why else were they
willing to shoot at us?

1105
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,351
Alamein Bank, Zurich,
Switzerland.

1106
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,688
Because
they're finished with you.

1107
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,275
Live or dead's the same.

1108
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:47,986
Long as you disappear.

1109
01:28:51,281 --> 01:28:53,616
Yeah. Can I have
your code, please?

1110
01:28:53,616 --> 01:28:59,164
Yes.
Blue-two-backslash-0-6-0-0.

1111
01:28:59,164 --> 01:29:00,874
"D" as in David.

1112
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,752
That's right.

1113
01:29:03,752 --> 01:29:05,462
The balance?

1114
01:29:09,216 --> 01:29:11,009
That's impossible.

1115
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:12,719
They already got it, Nicholas.

1116
01:29:13,804 --> 01:29:15,430
They got everything.

1117
01:29:22,062 --> 01:29:25,148
You've reached the Sutherlands.
Please leave a message.

1118
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:28,610
As you get this message, Sam, I have
checked them all. I don't know how,

1119
01:29:29,069 --> 01:29:31,780
but they have drained
my accounts.

1120
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:37,411
They're trying to kill me. Now you call
the cops. I got one of them right here.

1121
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:39,079
We'll make her testify.

1122
01:29:39,746 --> 01:29:41,915
I know how this sounds,

1123
01:29:41,915 --> 01:29:43,083
but you call me

1124
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,877
on my cellular.

1125
01:29:45,252 --> 01:29:46,920
And you be careful.

1126
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,131
They...

1127
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:51,216
They cut your card
in half so...

1128
01:29:52,635 --> 01:29:54,053
My treat.

1129
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,927
You take two sugars, right?

1130
01:30:36,012 --> 01:30:37,513
Never mind.

1131
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,814
My name's not Christine. It's...
I mean, it's not my real name.

1132
01:30:46,814 --> 01:30:48,441
Who fucking cares?

1133
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:52,946
It is just money. You
should be glad you're alive.

1134
01:30:53,238 --> 01:30:55,740
I'd rather not talk
about it right now.

1135
01:30:57,242 --> 01:30:58,618
All I mean is
someone like you...

1136
01:30:58,618 --> 01:31:00,537
How many times
have you done this?

1137
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:01,788
I'm curious.
What?

1138
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:04,082
These scams.
Con games, how many?

1139
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,334
Lots.

1140
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:09,546
But, whatever nickel-dime
bullshit you pulled in the past,

1141
01:31:09,546 --> 01:31:11,756
this is more than just me.

1142
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,217
This is pension plans,

1143
01:31:14,217 --> 01:31:15,510
payrolls.

1144
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:18,096
This is $600 million.

1145
01:31:31,526 --> 01:31:32,653
Yes.

1146
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,821
Nick, it's Sam.
I got your message.

1147
01:31:35,155 --> 01:31:37,115
I was disturbed
to say the least.

1148
01:31:37,115 --> 01:31:38,325
So, what are we gonna do?

1149
01:31:38,325 --> 01:31:40,535
I've been on the phone
for an hour already.

1150
01:31:40,535 --> 01:31:43,163
Nicholas,
your funds are intact.

1151
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:45,958
Nothing's been touched.

1152
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,377
What are you talking about?
I checked on them myself.

1153
01:31:48,377 --> 01:31:50,295
Who is it?
I made the calls.

1154
01:31:50,295 --> 01:31:51,964
Nothing's changed.

1155
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:55,175
I'm telling you. Not one cent
is unaccounted for.

1156
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:56,468
Who is it?

1157
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,471
My attorney says that
nothing is missing.

1158
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,390
He's in on it.

1159
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:04,268
I don't know what the hell is
happening, but stay where you are

1160
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:06,604
until I get there.
Sutherland's in on it.

1161
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,564
Nicholas, I have another call.

1162
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:10,691
Give me your precise location.

1163
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:12,735
Nicholas?

1164
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,699
We've got to
get out of here.

1165
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,832
How did they get to him?

1166
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,876
Why did...

1167
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,506
I wouldn't worry about it.

1168
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,805
What do you mean?

1169
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:43,474
It's out of your hands.

1170
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,792
Cellular calls
can be intercepted.

1171
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:13,421
Those calls you made
to B of A, France.

1172
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:17,092
B of A, France, Switzerland,
you were talking to us.

1173
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,802
You were talking to us.

1174
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:20,887
Filled in the blanks.
Access codes,

1175
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,139
passwords, access codes,
passwords...

1176
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:27,227
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

1177
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:29,396
We have it now
so we're done.

1178
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:44,453
Bye, Nicholas.

1179
01:36:09,558 --> 01:36:11,059
Things have happened

1180
01:36:11,769 --> 01:36:14,146
and it's important that...
Shh, shh, shh!

1181
01:36:16,398 --> 01:36:19,985
No money, no identification,
no passport.

1182
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:24,281
What happened to you?

1183
01:36:24,448 --> 01:36:26,158
Where to begin...

1184
01:36:28,661 --> 01:36:29,745
It's complicated.

1185
01:36:29,745 --> 01:36:31,121
It always is.

1186
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:38,462
I was on holiday alone

1187
01:36:39,255 --> 01:36:41,841
and I was robbed by two men. Robbed?

1188
01:36:43,676 --> 01:36:45,886
And what hotel
were you staying at?

1189
01:36:45,886 --> 01:36:48,222
I... I don't remember. I...

1190
01:36:50,349 --> 01:36:52,351
Have you gone to the police?

1191
01:36:53,728 --> 01:36:55,438
I don't speak Spanish.

1192
01:36:57,899 --> 01:37:00,610
And I just need enough
to get out of here.

1193
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:04,322
Oh, we'll help with the local law
enforcement if you wanted to bother.

1194
01:37:04,322 --> 01:37:07,784
As far as money is concerned,
can I make a suggestion?

1195
01:37:08,951 --> 01:37:10,870
You say you were mugged?

1196
01:37:11,537 --> 01:37:13,790
And they
didn't take that watch?

1197
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:18,419
How much is
a watch like that worth?

1198
01:37:18,419 --> 01:37:20,630
A couple of hundred at least.

1199
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:28,555
Man with a watch like that doesn't
necessarily have a passport problem.

1200
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:55,059
Excuse me?

1201
01:38:56,185 --> 01:38:58,646
Can I have your attention,
please?

1202
01:39:03,192 --> 01:39:04,652
Thank you.

1203
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,073
Anybody here going to San
Francisco? I need a ride.

1204
01:39:12,076 --> 01:39:14,787
I've got $18 and 70...

1205
01:39:15,163 --> 01:39:16,706
78 cents

1206
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,251
for a ride to San Francisco.

1207
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:27,383
Anybody?

1208
01:41:15,034 --> 01:41:16,828
Keep the change.
Thanks, pal.

1209
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:23,876
Conrad Van Orton. Could
you ring his room, please?

1210
01:41:24,585 --> 01:41:26,337
One moment, please.

1211
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:32,135
Is there a problem?

1212
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:34,178
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? Yes.

1213
01:41:34,178 --> 01:41:37,891
I'm the hotel manager. Pleasure
to meet you. Where's my brother?

1214
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:40,226
Will you come with me, sir?

1215
01:41:40,226 --> 01:41:42,187
Wait a minute,
is there trouble?

1216
01:41:43,354 --> 01:41:45,899
Sir, this is
a private matter for you.

1217
01:41:57,577 --> 01:42:01,248
There was some complaints by
other guests, damage to his room.

1218
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:03,833
We did the best we could
to accommodate his behavior.

1219
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:05,126
His behavior?
Yes, sir.

1220
01:42:05,126 --> 01:42:08,296
There was an incident
a few days ago.

1221
01:42:09,631 --> 01:42:11,800
A nervous breakdown,
they said.

1222
01:42:12,425 --> 01:42:14,177
The police took him.

1223
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,972
They left this address
in case anyone came.

1224
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:19,766
It's a hospital in Napa, sir.

1225
01:42:20,976 --> 01:42:22,602
I'm terribly sorry.

1226
01:42:39,828 --> 01:42:42,664
Elizabeth,
I need to borrow your car.

1227
01:42:43,582 --> 01:42:44,708
Nickie,

1228
01:42:45,751 --> 01:42:47,795
what happened to you?
I mean...

1229
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:51,131
Look at you. Look at
me. What happened, I...

1230
01:42:51,382 --> 01:42:53,676
I don't know. I... There're just
some things I have to do, all right?

1231
01:42:53,676 --> 01:42:54,927
I need your car.

1232
01:42:55,719 --> 01:42:58,305
Of course, you can have it
if you need it.

1233
01:43:00,391 --> 01:43:02,685
Can't I get you
something to eat?

1234
01:43:03,394 --> 01:43:05,729
You know that
you're the only person

1235
01:43:05,729 --> 01:43:07,231
that I can trust.

1236
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:12,111
Everyone else is...
If Sam Sutherland calls you,

1237
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:14,196
you don't tell him you
talked to me. You lie to him.

1238
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,074
And whatever else happens
before he speaks...

1239
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:18,951
Okay, coffee,

1240
01:43:19,243 --> 01:43:20,953
English muffin,

1241
01:43:20,953 --> 01:43:22,622
and your water.

1242
01:43:23,289 --> 01:43:24,957
This bottle

1243
01:43:25,374 --> 01:43:27,376
is open. Who opened this
bottle? Yeah, I opened it.

1244
01:43:27,418 --> 01:43:30,087
I don't want an opened bottle.
I want an unopened bottle.

1245
01:43:30,087 --> 01:43:33,466
I don't want ice in the glass.
I want just a glass,

1246
01:43:33,883 --> 01:43:35,218
please.

1247
01:43:39,389 --> 01:43:40,890
Nickie, talk to me.

1248
01:43:41,057 --> 01:43:42,642
You're scaring me.

1249
01:43:43,518 --> 01:43:45,228
I don't even know
what you're saying.

1250
01:43:45,395 --> 01:43:47,605
I'm sorry, Liz. I don't
mean it. I'm sorry.

1251
01:43:50,567 --> 01:43:54,320
You know, I've been thinking
the last couple of days.

1252
01:43:54,445 --> 01:43:57,031
I've had some spare time.

1253
01:44:00,577 --> 01:44:02,495
And I wanted to tell you that

1254
01:44:04,414 --> 01:44:06,791
I understand why you left me.

1255
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:10,045
And I know
that I resented it.

1256
01:44:15,383 --> 01:44:17,427
I want to apologize to you

1257
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:20,680
for shutting you out

1258
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:22,849
and not being there.

1259
01:44:23,809 --> 01:44:25,644
And I hope
that you can forgive me.

1260
01:44:25,644 --> 01:44:28,397
You're tired. You've
been on the go for days.

1261
01:44:28,397 --> 01:44:30,607
There's nothing to forgive.
Then,

1262
01:44:30,732 --> 01:44:32,109
pain sets in.

1263
01:44:32,693 --> 01:44:35,112
The onset of
a migraine headache.

1264
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,032
If this sounds all too
familiar, relief is here at last.

1265
01:44:39,032 --> 01:44:41,618
Oh no, you bastards.

1266
01:44:41,618 --> 01:44:44,830
Taggarene. For nearly a decade,
doctors have been prescribing...

1267
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:46,707
How did you find me here?

1268
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:53,255
Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches,
toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pains...

1269
01:44:53,255 --> 01:44:54,923
He's an actor.

1270
01:44:54,923 --> 01:44:57,926
So if you trust your doctor,
trust Taggarene.

1271
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:01,555
He's an actor on television.

1272
01:45:04,058 --> 01:45:05,726
Can't explain now.

1273
01:45:06,477 --> 01:45:08,187
Can I borrow
your Yellow Pages?

1274
01:45:31,878 --> 01:45:35,673
New Moon Cafe,
best in Chinatown.

1275
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:39,177
Get out of the car, fucker.

1276
01:45:39,177 --> 01:45:41,137
Open the door
and leave it running.

1277
01:45:41,137 --> 01:45:42,221
You're making
a mistake here.

1278
01:45:42,221 --> 01:45:45,641
Get the fuck
out of the car.

1279
01:45:45,641 --> 01:45:48,353
I am extremely fragile

1280
01:45:48,936 --> 01:45:50,271
right now.

1281
01:45:59,531 --> 01:46:02,867
New Moon Cafe.

1282
01:46:03,368 --> 01:46:05,870
He does commercials. Do you
know how many customers we have?

1283
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,163
Hundreds, thousands.

1284
01:46:07,163 --> 01:46:10,917
I know he ordered from you. He
went to Montgomery Street. 1010...

1285
01:46:12,752 --> 01:46:14,546
Is there anybody here
that can help me?

1286
01:46:14,546 --> 01:46:18,800
He's an actor. He's like one of these
people you have here up on your...

1287
01:46:31,271 --> 01:46:32,898
Hey!
Why are you taking my picture?

1288
01:46:34,775 --> 01:46:37,277
We were hoping
he could audition today.

1289
01:46:37,277 --> 01:46:39,571
He'd really be
perfect for this part.

1290
01:46:39,571 --> 01:46:41,782
Oh,
this will break his heart.

1291
01:46:41,782 --> 01:46:44,534
Well is there any place
we can contact him?

1292
01:46:44,534 --> 01:46:47,079
Well, his beeper's
here on the table.

1293
01:46:47,079 --> 01:46:48,622
He took
the kids to the zoo.

1294
01:46:48,622 --> 01:46:50,999
The zoo?
That's very, very sweet.

1295
01:46:50,999 --> 01:46:53,252
Which zoo? Oh, it's the
one with the white tiger.

1296
01:46:57,673 --> 01:47:00,092
Lionel Fisher,
I love your work.

1297
01:47:02,928 --> 01:47:04,930
Okay, please.
Look, I, uh...

1298
01:47:05,305 --> 01:47:06,807
I got my kids.

1299
01:47:07,933 --> 01:47:09,476
Get rid of them.

1300
01:47:09,476 --> 01:47:11,312
All right, guys, uh, guys.

1301
01:47:11,312 --> 01:47:14,315
Snack time. More
snacks. Here, go, go, go.

1302
01:47:16,025 --> 01:47:17,443
That's all. Uh...

1303
01:47:18,277 --> 01:47:20,821
It was just a job.
Nothing personal.

1304
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,199
You know. I mean,
I play my part,

1305
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,534
improvise a little. I mean,
it's what I'm good at...

1306
01:47:25,534 --> 01:47:28,329
I need to talk
to who's in charge.

1307
01:47:28,662 --> 01:47:29,997
Nobody knows.

1308
01:47:30,414 --> 01:47:32,375
I mean nobody
gets a big picture...

1309
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:35,252
Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out.
Damn it, why do they do that?

1310
01:47:35,252 --> 01:47:39,090
Your offices are empty. I need
to find out where they are.

1311
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:43,469
Look,

1312
01:47:43,636 --> 01:47:46,013
they own the whole building.

1313
01:47:46,013 --> 01:47:48,015
They just move
from floor to floor.

1314
01:47:48,015 --> 01:47:49,433
And you work for them,
right?

1315
01:47:49,684 --> 01:47:51,269
You can get me in.

1316
01:47:51,978 --> 01:47:53,980
No, I can't.
Oh, yes, you can.

1317
01:47:54,021 --> 01:47:57,400
You can tell them the police
called. You got to speak to someone.

1318
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,402
You tell them I'm gonna
blow the whistle on them.

1319
01:47:59,402 --> 01:48:01,654
What whistle?
There's no fucking whistle.

1320
01:48:01,654 --> 01:48:03,990
This is very dangerous.

1321
01:48:06,326 --> 01:48:08,286
I don't think
that you understand.

1322
01:48:10,788 --> 01:48:12,040
Right now

1323
01:48:12,999 --> 01:48:14,167
I am

1324
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:15,418
extremely

1325
01:48:15,627 --> 01:48:16,920
dangerous.

1326
01:48:20,131 --> 01:48:23,301
Michael, guys.
Come on, we're leaving.

1327
01:48:34,813 --> 01:48:36,022
Well we're here.

1328
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:37,732
Drive in.

1329
01:48:43,196 --> 01:48:45,365
What're you gonna do, anyway?

1330
01:48:45,615 --> 01:48:47,367
You won't get
your money back.

1331
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:51,121
I don't care about money.
I'm pulling back the curtain.

1332
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:53,373
I wanna meet the wizard.

1333
01:48:59,588 --> 01:49:01,715
He's eyeing us
like Tiffany Towers.

1334
01:49:01,924 --> 01:49:04,510
Pull in somewhere
where they won't see you.

1335
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,825
Shit. Stay down. Stay down.

1336
01:49:33,831 --> 01:49:35,624
You're not allowed
to be here.

1337
01:49:35,624 --> 01:49:36,709
They called me back.

1338
01:49:36,959 --> 01:49:38,210
I got a fitting.

1339
01:49:39,128 --> 01:49:40,588
He's with me.

1340
01:49:43,841 --> 01:49:46,093
You don't need me.
Shut up.

1341
01:49:46,969 --> 01:49:48,930
Get in.
Oh, my God.

1342
01:49:49,555 --> 01:49:51,307
Cuff him to the rail.

1343
01:49:56,854 --> 01:49:58,231
What floor?

1344
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:21,004
You're fucked, you both.
They're gonna miss me.

1345
01:50:21,629 --> 01:50:24,048
Where? I told you they
hired me over the phone...

1346
01:50:24,048 --> 01:50:25,300
Where did you
pick up your checks?

1347
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,760
It was a different floor then.

1348
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,763
Then guess. I... It went
on this way, sort of...

1349
01:50:29,763 --> 01:50:31,222
I don't know.

1350
01:50:34,559 --> 01:50:36,394
All right, take it easy.

1351
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:07,342
It's gonna be a surprise.

1352
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:28,322
Oh, fuck!

1353
01:51:30,324 --> 01:51:32,284
What are you doing here?

1354
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:34,995
Back from the dead.

1355
01:51:44,797 --> 01:51:47,466
Nicholas, you're not
about to shoot anyone.

1356
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:49,385
Turn around.

1357
01:51:57,602 --> 01:51:59,770
You're gonna come with me.

1358
01:52:00,062 --> 01:52:01,564
Everybody down!

1359
01:52:34,097 --> 01:52:35,515
Stop!

1360
01:52:43,982 --> 01:52:46,568
All right, what do you
think you're doing?

1361
01:52:46,568 --> 01:52:47,944
You tell me!

1362
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,530
Who's behind this?

1363
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,532
Who did this to me?
Why?

1364
01:52:52,532 --> 01:52:55,952
What do you mean, "Why?" How deluded
can you be? Who is responsible for this?

1365
01:52:55,952 --> 01:52:58,121
It wasn't you.
It wasn't personal.

1366
01:52:58,121 --> 01:53:00,874
It could've been any asshole with a
couple of hundred million in the bank.

1367
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:03,293
Get on that radio, all right?
You get your boss up here.

1368
01:53:03,293 --> 01:53:05,378
You tell them
I'm gonna shoot somebody.

1369
01:53:05,378 --> 01:53:07,047
Who am I gonna call,
Nicholas? They won't do it.

1370
01:53:07,047 --> 01:53:09,424
Oh, yes, they will.
You get somebody up here

1371
01:53:09,424 --> 01:53:11,677
because I'm gonna kill you. They
don't care about me, Nicholas.

1372
01:53:11,677 --> 01:53:14,930
They'll let me die. You're not
in a position to threaten anyone.

1373
01:53:15,138 --> 01:53:16,556
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get that?

1374
01:53:16,556 --> 01:53:17,599
What?

1375
01:53:18,183 --> 01:53:20,936
That gun.
That's not an automatic.

1376
01:53:20,936 --> 01:53:22,604
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1377
01:53:22,604 --> 01:53:24,690
The guard had an automatic.
Where did you get the gun?

1378
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:25,858
This is my gun.

1379
01:53:25,858 --> 01:53:27,359
But we searched the house.

1380
01:53:27,609 --> 01:53:29,570
Well I guess you missed this,
didn't you?

1381
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:32,823
There's a situation up here. We
got a real goddamn gun up here...

1382
01:53:33,532 --> 01:53:35,784
Nicholas, it's fake.
It's a part of your game.

1383
01:53:35,784 --> 01:53:37,578
Don't you start with me now.
No, no, listen to me.

1384
01:53:37,578 --> 01:53:39,496
Don't you fucking start with me.
I'm telling you the truth now.

1385
01:53:39,496 --> 01:53:40,914
This is all the game.

1386
01:53:40,914 --> 01:53:43,000
Bullshit, all right? Bullshit.
I know what happened to that guy.

1387
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,377
They shot that guy, Feingold, Fisher,
they killed him. What did you see?

1388
01:53:45,377 --> 01:53:46,962
Think about it. What'd you
see? I saw them kill him.

1389
01:53:46,962 --> 01:53:50,049
No, what'd you really
really see, this whole time?

1390
01:53:50,049 --> 01:53:53,052
Special effects, squibs.
Squibs like in the movies.

1391
01:53:53,052 --> 01:53:54,845
Nicholas. Nicholas, listen.

1392
01:53:56,347 --> 01:53:58,182
I've got a real gun
with real goddamned bullets...

1393
01:53:58,182 --> 01:54:00,351
Okay, okay.
I'll put it down.

1394
01:54:01,852 --> 01:54:05,189
Feingold, Mr. Fisher. He's on the
other side of that door. He's an actor.

1395
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:07,149
You're trying to kill me. No
one's trying to kill you, Nicholas.

1396
01:54:07,149 --> 01:54:09,944
Please put that gun down. You're about
to make the biggest mistake of your life.

1397
01:54:09,944 --> 01:54:13,698
Nicholas, there was always a safety net.
The taxi, there was a diver. My house,

1398
01:54:13,698 --> 01:54:15,575
they shot at us
with blanks.

1399
01:54:15,575 --> 01:54:16,659
It's not true.

1400
01:54:16,659 --> 01:54:18,536
It is. It's what
you hired us for.

1401
01:54:18,536 --> 01:54:21,205
They're waiting on the other
side of that door with champagne.

1402
01:54:21,205 --> 01:54:22,665
Nicholas.

1403
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:26,919
Please, goddamn it!
Conrad. Conrad's there.

1404
01:54:26,919 --> 01:54:28,713
It's your birthday party.

1405
01:54:28,713 --> 01:54:30,256
You stop lying!

1406
01:54:33,092 --> 01:54:34,719
Let me show you.

1407
01:54:36,054 --> 01:54:37,931
Don't you move.

1408
01:54:38,848 --> 01:54:41,392
He's got a gun.
Get back from the door.

1409
01:54:55,699 --> 01:54:57,158
You shot him.

1410
01:55:04,583 --> 01:55:07,085
Someone...
Someone call an ambulance!

1411
01:55:27,814 --> 01:55:29,149
He's dead.

1412
01:55:34,404 --> 01:55:36,156
We thought you knew.

1413
01:55:40,285 --> 01:55:42,955
How did you let this
get so out of hand?

1414
01:55:44,123 --> 01:55:46,208
He wouldn't listen to me.

1415
01:55:49,461 --> 01:55:51,797
We went through this
over and over.

1416
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,804
The mark is
your responsibility.

1417
01:55:59,471 --> 01:56:00,598
You never,

1418
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,642
never let
the mark take over.

1419
01:56:05,978 --> 01:56:08,606
I'm sorry. He could
have almost killed us.

1420
01:56:10,232 --> 01:56:12,193
I had a walkie-talkie.

1421
01:56:12,526 --> 01:56:14,528
I used the walkie-talkie.

1422
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:18,741
We're going to jail.

1423
01:56:18,741 --> 01:56:22,328
We're all going to jail
for the rest of our lives.

1424
01:56:32,588 --> 01:56:33,923
Oh, God.

1425
01:56:35,383 --> 01:56:36,676
Nicholas!

1426
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,838
We've got him.
He's in the bag.

1427
01:57:13,838 --> 01:57:16,383
We have him here.
He came in right on target.

1428
01:57:19,177 --> 01:57:22,597
Keep everyone back until we
clear away the breakaway glass.

1429
01:57:24,266 --> 01:57:26,184
Mr. Van Orton,
don't open your eyes.

1430
01:57:26,184 --> 01:57:29,187
It's just breakaway glass,
but it can still cut you.

1431
01:57:30,689 --> 01:57:32,441
Just gonna take a look at you.

1432
01:57:32,441 --> 01:57:34,318
I'm gonna check your pulse.

1433
01:57:39,281 --> 01:57:42,075
Just take it easy.
That was quite a fall.

1434
01:58:13,732 --> 01:58:15,609
Happy birthday, Nickie.

1435
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:29,790
What is this?

1436
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,543
It's your birthday present.

1437
01:58:52,522 --> 01:58:55,692
I had to do something. You
were becoming such an asshole.

1438
01:59:07,328 --> 01:59:10,123
Ladies and gentlemen. My
brother, Nicholas Van Orton.

1439
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:49,538
Amazing. I just wanted
to tell you. Great job.

1440
01:59:49,538 --> 01:59:51,540
This was the best ever.

1441
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,377
Thank God you jumped.
Because if you didn't,

1442
01:59:55,377 --> 01:59:57,129
I was supposed
to throw you off.

1443
01:59:57,129 --> 01:59:58,464
Thanks.

1444
01:59:59,548 --> 02:00:02,760
We have to head home. We
just wanted to say goodbye.

1445
02:00:03,177 --> 02:00:04,553
Rachel.

1446
02:00:04,928 --> 02:00:06,388
Sweet dreams.

1447
02:00:08,599 --> 02:00:12,645
Thanks, Mel, for coming. I'm
sorry about your car. I...

1448
02:00:12,645 --> 02:00:14,980
I think I left it at the zoo.
No problem.

1449
02:00:21,654 --> 02:00:23,614
Happy birthday, Nicholas.

1450
02:00:25,866 --> 02:00:27,993
I'll call you.
I really will.

1451
02:00:43,968 --> 02:00:47,472
Nicholas, I haven't a clue
what this is all about.

1452
02:00:47,638 --> 02:00:50,933
Your taste in champagne
is excellent as always.

1453
02:00:50,933 --> 02:00:52,769
It was a great entrance.

1454
02:00:54,145 --> 02:00:56,189
Yes, and I want you to know that
what happened on Sunday was...

1455
02:00:56,189 --> 02:00:57,774
Oh, no, no, please.

1456
02:00:58,149 --> 02:01:00,818
I've never been happier
in my whole life.

1457
02:01:00,818 --> 02:01:02,612
I thank you.

1458
02:01:02,612 --> 02:01:04,614
And my wife thanks you.

1459
02:01:06,324 --> 02:01:08,117
Thank you for coming.

1460
02:01:08,701 --> 02:01:10,286
Thank you, Sam.

1461
02:01:13,081 --> 02:01:14,290
What's this?

1462
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:16,042
This is

1463
02:01:17,961 --> 02:01:19,254
the bill.

1464
02:01:20,588 --> 02:01:22,048
The bill?

1465
02:01:22,048 --> 02:01:23,508
Keep the pen.

1466
02:01:24,884 --> 02:01:26,594
Thank you, both.

1467
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,312
You wanna split it?

1468
02:01:35,353 --> 02:01:38,315
Oh, God, yes, please.
I'll take you up on that.

1469
02:01:40,192 --> 02:01:41,568
Oh, my God.

1470
02:01:46,073 --> 02:01:47,783
Thank you, Connie.

1471
02:01:51,578 --> 02:01:53,956
What happened to that

1472
02:01:53,956 --> 02:01:56,166
waitress?
What was her name, uh...

1473
02:01:56,667 --> 02:01:57,751
Christine?

1474
02:01:58,001 --> 02:01:59,878
She said something
about catching a plane.

1475
02:01:59,878 --> 02:02:02,673
I just saw her out front
trying to hail a cab.

1476
02:02:21,692 --> 02:02:23,068
Christine?

1477
02:02:25,571 --> 02:02:26,947
I, um...

1478
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:29,200
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

1479
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,910
Thank you. I...

1480
02:02:31,076 --> 02:02:34,079
You know, I never did
ask you your name, did I?

1481
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:35,289
No.

1482
02:02:35,539 --> 02:02:37,124
It's

1483
02:02:37,124 --> 02:02:38,376
Claire.

1484
02:02:38,376 --> 02:02:41,420
So you catching a plane or...

1485
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:44,423
Yeah, we have a gig starting
next week in Australia, so...

1486
02:02:44,423 --> 02:02:46,300
Gonna shear some more sheep.

1487
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,927
Just a walk-on this time.

1488
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:50,054
Well, when you get back,

1489
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:55,560
maybe, you know,
we could have some dinner.

1490
02:02:56,561 --> 02:02:58,938
You don't know
anything about me.

1491
02:02:59,355 --> 02:03:00,898
No, I don't.

1492
02:03:01,441 --> 02:03:02,734
So you tell me.

1493
02:03:02,984 --> 02:03:04,527
Well, what...
Where you're from?

1494
02:03:06,696 --> 02:03:07,989
Originally,

1495
02:03:08,364 --> 02:03:09,699
Oklahoma.

1496
02:03:10,658 --> 02:03:11,909
Colorado?

1497
02:03:15,455 --> 02:03:17,749
I've been doing this
for way too long.

1498
02:03:20,043 --> 02:03:21,544
You know,

1499
02:03:23,713 --> 02:03:25,173
would you like

1500
02:03:25,590 --> 02:03:27,842
to have coffee with me
at the airport?
