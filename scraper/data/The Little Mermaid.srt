00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,977
<i>I'll tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue</i>

3
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,980
<i>And it's, hey
to the starboard Heave-ho</i>

4
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:01,567
<i>Look out, lad
A mermaid be waiting for you</i>

5
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:04,362
<i>In mysterious
fathoms below</i>

6
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:06,906
Isn't this great?
The salty sea air,

7
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,909
the wind blowing
in your face.

8
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:15,581
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.

9
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,376
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

10
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:22,088
King Triton must be
in a friendly-type mood.

11
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:25,883
- King Triton?
- Why, ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

12
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,678
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

13
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:33,933
Merpeople.
Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.

14
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,644
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

15
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,607
<i>I'm tellin' ya'
Down in the depths of the ocean they live' Oh'</i>

16
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:46,445
<i>- Aah'
- In mysterious fathoms below</i>

17
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,547
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!

18
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,566
And presenting the
distinguished court composer...

19
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:51,612
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian.

20
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:02,623
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

21
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,626
Your Majesty.

22
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:09,922
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.

23
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:14,760
Your daughters--
They will be spectacular.

24
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,137
Yes.

25
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:20,558
- And especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

26
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:24,854
She has the most
beautiful voice. Hmm?

27
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,982
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

28
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:56,635
<i>Ah, we are the daughters
of Triton</i>

29
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:59,805
<i>Great father who loves us
and named us well</i>

30
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,059
<i>Aquata</i>

31
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,728
<i>Andrina</i>

32
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,814
<i>Arista, Attina</i>

33
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,859
<i>Adella, Alana</i>

34
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:14,904
<i>And then there is the youngest
in her musical debut</i>

35
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,823
<i>Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you</i>

36
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,659
<i>To sing a song Sebastian wrote
her voice is like a bell</i>

37
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:24,038
<i>She's our sister Ari--</i>

38
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:28,668
Ariel!

39
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:35,174
Ariel, wait for me.

40
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,010
Flounder, hurry up.

41
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,014
You know I can't swim that fast.

42
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,142
There it is.

43
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:47,520
Isn't it fantastic?

44
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,189
Yeah, sure.
I-It's great.

45
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,358
Now let's get outta here.

46
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:54,694
You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?

47
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,697
Who, me? No way.

48
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:01,325
It's just-- It, uh--
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

49
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,203
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

50
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:08,040
Yeah, I got this cough.

51
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,626
All right.
I'm going inside.

52
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:12,920
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

53
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:16,340
Okay. Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and--

54
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:19,385
What? Sharks? Ariel!

55
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:23,639
Ariel, I can't-- I mean--

56
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:26,308
Ariel, help!

57
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,270
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

58
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,565
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

59
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,735
- Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
- I'm not a guppy.

60
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,406
This is great.

61
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,409
I mean, I really love this.

62
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:48,289
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner--

63
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,336
Ariel!

64
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:55,588
Oh, are you okay?

65
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,923
Yeah, sure.
No problem. I'm okay.

66
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,309
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

67
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:11,979
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

68
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:15,775
Wow! Cool!
But, uh, what is it?

69
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:20,988
- I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
- What was that?

70
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:25,284
- Did you hear something?
- Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

71
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,454
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

72
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,790
Nothing is going to happen.

73
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,711
Shark! Shark!
We're gonna die!

74
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,313
Oh, no!

75
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,845
You big bully!

76
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:32,184
- Flounder, you really are a guppy.
- I am not.

77
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:37,940
<i>Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred
and ninety-two</i>

78
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,443
<i>Dum-de-dum
Do-do-do</i>

79
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,029
<i>Rum-dim-dim
Do-do-dee-do</i>

80
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,614
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!

81
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:49,410
Mermaid off the port bow!

82
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,414
Ariel, how you doin', kid?

83
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:57,251
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

84
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,212
Yeah, we were in this sunken
ship, and it was really creepy--

85
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:03,591
Human stuff, huh?
Hey, let me see.

86
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:11,766
Oh! Oh!
Look at this.

87
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:15,311
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

88
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:19,440
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

89
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:24,820
Humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out.

90
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:29,700
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and viola--

91
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:33,662
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair...

92
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,831
that humans go nuts over.

93
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:37,917
A dinglehopper.

94
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,919
- What about that one?
- Ah!

95
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:45,633
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful.

96
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,469
A banded, bulbous...

97
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,596
- snarfblatt.
- Oh!

98
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:54,016
Now, the snarfblatt dates back
to prehistorical times...

99
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:59,605
when humans used to sit around
and stare at each other all day.

100
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,607
Got very boring.

101
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:06,237
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

102
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:08,614
Allow me.

103
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:10,157
Music!

104
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,535
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

105
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:16,455
- Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
- The concert was today?

106
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,792
- Maybe you could make a little planter
out of it or something. - I'm sorry.

107
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,169
I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

108
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:26,007
Anytime, sweetie. Anytime.

109
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,858
Yes, hurry home,
Princess.

110
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:49,363
We wouldn't want to miss
old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?

111
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:54,035
Ha! Celebration, indeed.
Oh, bah!

112
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:59,123
In my day, we had
fantastical feasts...

113
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:02,668
when I lived in the palace.

114
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:07,298
And, now, look at me.

115
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,176
Wasted away to
practically nothing.

116
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:14,305
Banished and exiled
and practically starving...

117
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,393
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

118
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,523
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

119
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:26,776
Flotsam! Jetsam!

120
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:32,031
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

121
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:37,161
She may be the key
to Triton's undoing.

122
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:44,710
I just don't know what we're going
to do with you, young lady.

123
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:46,712
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I just forgot.

124
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,800
- As a result of your careless behavior--
- Careless and reckless behavior--

125
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,094
The entire celebration
was, uh--

126
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,889
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

127
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:02,728
This concert was to be the pinnacle
of my distinguished career.

128
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,856
Now, thanks to you, I am
the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!

129
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:11,987
But it wasn't her fault--
Uh, oh, first, uh, the shark chased us.

130
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:15,574
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to--
but we couldn't, and he--

131
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,828
And-- And we--
Whoa!

132
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,830
And then we were safe.

133
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:24,333
But then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this, and that is that". And--

134
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,586
Seagull?
What? Oh.

135
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:31,298
You went up to the surface
again, didn't you? Didn't you?

136
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:37,179
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?

137
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:41,934
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by-by one of those humans.

138
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,520
- Daddy, they're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

139
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,605
Do you think I want to see
my youngest daughter...

140
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,607
snared by some fish-eater's hook?

141
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,193
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

142
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,946
Don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young lady.

143
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:57,491
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

144
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,327
- But if you would just listen--
- Not another word!

145
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,998
And I am never, never to hear
of you going to the surface again!

146
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,292
Is that clear?

147
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:17,136
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.

148
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,848
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

149
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:24,894
Do you think
I was too hard on her?

150
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:26,896
Definitely not.

151
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:31,359
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

152
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:35,905
None of this flitting to the
surface and other such nonsense.

153
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:38,824
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

154
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,702
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

155
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,664
- Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

156
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,333
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

157
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,753
- All the time.
- And you are just the crab to do it.

158
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:55,841
How do I get myself
into these situations?

159
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:57,927
I should be writing symphonies...

160
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:01,597
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

161
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:08,854
Hmm? What is that girl up to?

162
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,384
Huh?

163
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:47,810
Ariel, are you okay?

164
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:51,105
If only I could
make him understand.

165
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:54,191
I just don't see things
the way he does.

166
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:58,404
I don't see how a world that
makes such wonderful things...

167
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:00,406
could be bad.

168
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:04,827
<i>Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?</i>

169
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,205
<i>Wouldn't you think
my collection's complete?</i>

170
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,166
<i>Wouldn't you think
I'm the girI</i>

171
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:14,879
<i>The girl who has
everything?</i>

172
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:18,215
<i>Look at this trove
Treasures untoId</i>

173
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:21,594
<i>How many wonders
can one cavern hold?</i>

174
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,305
<i>Lookin' around here
you'd think</i>

175
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:27,683
<i>Sure, she's got
everything</i>

176
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,062
<i>I've got gadgets
and gizmos aplenty</i>

177
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:35,107
<i>I've got whozits
and whatzits galore</i>

178
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,944
<i>You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty</i>

179
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,240
<i>But who cares?
No big deal</i>

180
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:48,329
<i>I want more</i>

181
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:53,793
<i>I wanna be
where the people are</i>

182
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:57,922
<i>I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin'</i>

183
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:01,759
<i>WaIkin' around on those--
What do ya call 'em?</i>

184
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,804
<i>Oh, feet.</i>

185
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,808
<i>Flippin' your fins
you don't get too far</i>

186
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,977
<i>Legs are required
for jumpin', dancin'</i>

187
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,815
<i>Strollin' along down a--
What's that word again?</i>

188
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,817
<i>Street</i>

189
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:21,570
<i>Up where they walk
Up where they run</i>

190
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:25,658
<i>Up where they stay
all day in the sun</i>

191
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:29,495
<i>Wanderin' free
Wish I could be</i>

192
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,665
<i>Part of that world</i>

193
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,835
<i>What wouId I give
if I couId live</i>

194
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,838
<i>Out of these waters?</i>

195
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:42,258
<i>What would I pay
to spend a day</i>

196
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:45,594
<i>Warm on the sand?</i>

197
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:48,597
<i>Bet ya on land
they understand</i>

198
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:53,227
<i>Bet they don't reprimand
their daughters</i>

199
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:56,689
<i>Bright young women
sick of swimmin'</i>

200
00:16:56,814 --> 00:17:02,069
<i>Ready to stand</i>

201
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:05,990
<i>And ready to know
what the people know</i>

202
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:09,618
<i>Ask 'em my questions
and get some answers</i>

203
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:14,040
<i>What's a fire and why does it--
What's the word?</i>

204
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,125
<i>Burn</i>

205
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:19,962
<i>When's it my turn?
Wouldn't l love</i>

206
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:25,885
<i>Love to explore
that shore up above?</i>

207
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:30,765
<i>Out of the sea</i>

208
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:34,435
<i>Wish I could be</i>

209
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,148
<i>Part of that</i>

210
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:43,986
<i>World</i>

211
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,424
Sebastian!

212
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:14,141
Ariel, what are you--
How could you-- What is all this?

213
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:17,687
It's, uh--
It's just my collection.

214
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:20,856
Oh, I see.

215
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:25,736
Your collection, hmm. If your
father knew about this place--

216
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,780
You're not gonna tell him,
are you?

217
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,324
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

218
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:34,453
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

219
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,872
Come with me.
I'll take you home...

220
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,125
and get you something
warm to drink.

221
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,711
- What do you suppose--
- Ariel?

222
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:45,673
Ariel?

223
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,978
Ariel, what are you--

224
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,647
Jumpin' jellyfish!

225
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:08,487
Ariel? Ariel!
Please! Come back!

226
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:49,195
Max! Here, boy!

227
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:58,579
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

228
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:01,582
Come on, Max.

229
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,919
Good boy. Good boy.

230
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,094
Hey there, sweetie!
Quite a show, eh?

231
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,096
Scuttle, be quiet.
They'll hear you.

232
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:17,973
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

233
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,852
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

234
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:25,898
I've never seen a human
this close before.

235
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:31,112
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

236
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:35,324
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

237
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,493
Not that one.

238
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,663
The one playing the snarfblatt.

239
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,499
Silence, silence.

240
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:46,460
It is now my honor and privilege...

241
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,838
to present our esteemed
Prince Eric...

242
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:51,757
with a very special,
very expensive...

243
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:54,510
very large birthday present.

244
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:58,097
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

245
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:00,099
I know.

246
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,935
Happy birthday, Eric.

247
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,693
Uh, gee, Grim-- Ha'

248
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,321
It's, uh--
It's-It's really somethin'.

249
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:16,407
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

250
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:20,453
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

251
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,955
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

252
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,207
Look, you're not still sore
because I didn't fall for...

253
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,209
the princess of Glowehaven,
are you?

254
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:30,629
Oh, my! Oh, Eric,
it isn't me alone.

255
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:34,008
The entire kingdom wants
to see you happily settled down...

256
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,010
with the right girl.

257
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:38,637
Oh, she's out there somewhere.
I just--

258
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:42,350
I just haven't found her yet.

259
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,686
Well, perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

260
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:48,439
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

261
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:53,194
Without a doubt, it'll just--
bam-- hit me like lightning.

262
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,701
Hurricane a-comin'!

263
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:06,040
Stand fast!
Secure the riggin'!

264
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:27,395
Whoa! The wind's all ofa sudden
on the move here! Yo!

265
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:30,731
Ariel!

266
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,727
Look out!

267
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:23,367
Grim! Ha-Hang on!

268
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,748
Max!

269
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:48,267
Jump, Max! Come on, boy!
Jump! You can do it, Max!

270
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,861
Eric!

271
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,613
Is he... dead?

272
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:46,033
It's hard to say.

273
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,748
Oh, I-- I can't
make out a heartbeat.

274
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:57,420
No, look'
He's breathing.

275
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,506
He's so beautiful.

276
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:06,595
<i>What would I give
to live where you are</i>

277
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:10,683
<i>What would I pay
to stay here beside you</i>

278
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:17,732
<i>What would I do to see you
smiling at me</i>

279
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:21,527
<i>Where would we walk
Where would we run</i>

280
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:25,239
<i>If we could stay all day
in the sun</i>

281
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:29,577
<i>Just you and me
and I could be</i>

282
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:33,706
<i>Part of your world</i>

283
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:39,712
Eric? Eric!

284
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:44,091
You really delight in
these sadistic strains...

285
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,969
on my blood pressure, don't you?

286
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:49,722
A-A girl... rescued me.

287
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:53,768
She-- She was singing.

288
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:57,730
She had the most
beautiful voice.

289
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:01,901
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.

290
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:05,613
Off we go.
Come on, Max.

291
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,616
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.

292
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,785
The sea king will never know.

293
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:15,623
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.

294
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,753
<i>I don't know when
I don't know how</i>

295
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:27,093
<i>But I know something's
starting right now</i>

296
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,429
<i>Watch and you'll see</i>

297
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:33,766
<i>Someday I'll be</i>

298
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,268
<i>Part of your</i>

299
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:41,148
<i>World</i>

300
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:56,831
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.

301
00:26:56,998 --> 00:27:00,292
The child is in love
with a human.

302
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,629
And not just any human.
A prince'

303
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,050
Her daddy will love that.

304
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:11,303
King Triton's headstrong,
lovesick girl...

305
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,726
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.

306
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:30,990
Ariel, dear, time to come out.

307
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,034
You've been in there
all morning.

308
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:39,373
What is with her lately?

309
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:46,672
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well.

310
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,139
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

311
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,018
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

312
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:03,272
Ariel? In love?

313
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:06,025
Okay. So far, so good.

314
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,236
I don't think the king knows.

315
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:13,324
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

316
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,578
He loves me.

317
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:20,706
Mmm. He loves me not.

318
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:25,252
He loves me!
I knew it!

319
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,254
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

320
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,840
I gotta see him again...
tonight.

321
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,802
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!

322
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:36,430
Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

323
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:40,518
I'll swim up to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

324
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:43,312
- And then we'll go--
- Down here is your home!

325
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,606
Ariel, listen to me.

326
00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:47,608
<i>The human world--
It's a mess</i>

327
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:52,613
<i>Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there</i>

328
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,618
<i>The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake</i>

329
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,954
<i>You dream about
going up there</i>

330
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,623
<i>But that is a big mistake</i>

331
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,875
<i>Just look at the world
around you</i>

332
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,336
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

333
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,755
<i>Such wonderfuI things
around you</i>

334
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,383
<i>What more is you lookin' for</i>

335
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:17,138
<i>Under the sea
Under the sea</i>

336
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:21,600
<i>Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter take it from me</i>

337
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:26,313
<i>Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away</i>

338
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,817
<i>While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea</i>

339
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,991
<i>Down here all the fish is happy</i>

340
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,660
<i>As off through the waves
they roll ,yeah</i>

341
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:41,662
<i>The fish on the land
ain't happy</i>

342
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:44,498
<i>They sad
'cause they in the bowl</i>

343
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:47,126
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky</i>

344
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,295
<i>They in for a worser fate</i>

345
00:29:49,462 --> 00:29:51,839
<i>One day when the boss get hungry</i>

346
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,841
<i>Guess who's gonna
be on the plate</i>

347
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,469
<i>What? No!
Under the sea</i>

348
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,846
<i>Under the sea</i>

349
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:03,684
<i>Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee</i>

350
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:06,562
<i>We what the land folks
loves to cook</i>

351
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,564
<i>Under the sea
we off the hook</i>

352
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:11,400
<i>We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles</i>

353
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:13,694
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

354
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:15,696
<i>- Under the sea

355
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,449
<i>Since life is sweet here
we got it beat here</i>

356
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:21,369
<i>- Naturally
- Naturally</i>

357
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:25,831
<i>Even the sturgeon and the ray
they get the urge and start to play</i>

358
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:30,878
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it under the sea</i>

359
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,214
<i>The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp</i>

360
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,675
<i>The plaice play the bass
and they soundin' sharp</i>

361
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,177
<i>The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub</i>

362
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:40,554
<i>- The fluke is the duke of soul
- Yeah!</i>

363
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,890
<i>The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings</i>

364
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,226
<i>The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, he sings</i>

365
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:47,853
<i>The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at</i>

366
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:50,564
<i>And, oh, that blowfish blow</i>

367
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:18,509
<i>- Yeah, under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

368
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:21,053
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

369
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,097
<i>When the sardine
begin the beguine</i>

370
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:25,099
<i>- It's music to me
- Music it is to me</i>

371
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:28,185
<i>What do they got
A lot of sand</i>

372
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,438
<i>We got a hot crustacean band</i>

373
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:33,733
<i>Each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea</i>

374
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:39,905
<i>Each little slug here
cutting a rug here under the sea</i>

375
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,408
<i>Each little snail here

376
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,910
<i>That's why it's hotter
under the water</i>

377
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,079
<i>Yeah, we in luck here
down in the muck here</i>

378
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:52,251
<i>Under the sea</i>

379
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:58,257
Ariel?

380
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,431
Oh, somebody's got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

381
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,934
Sebastian!

382
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,272
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

383
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:17,360
- I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
- The sea king?

384
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:20,946
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

385
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:26,661
- He knows.
- Hey, let's see now.

386
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:30,956
Oh, who could
the lucky merman be?

387
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:39,465
Come in, Sebastian.

388
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,679
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.

389
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,395
Yes?

390
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:56,023
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Yes, Sebastian.

391
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,734
I'm concerned about Ariel.

392
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:02,154
Have you noticed
she's been acting peculiar lately?

393
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,201
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

394
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,997
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

395
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:13,165
You haven't noticed, hmm?

396
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,043
Oh, well, I--

397
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,506
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

398
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:24,510
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

399
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,847
Keeping something?

400
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,849
About Ariel?

401
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,397
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

402
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:42,028
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

403
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,197
I told her to stay away
from humans! They are bad!

404
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:50,036
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

405
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,038
Humans?

406
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,459
Who said anything about humans?

407
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:02,256
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

408
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:06,677
You'll see.
It's a surprise.

409
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,804
Oh, Flounder.

410
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:12,808
Flounder, you're the best!

411
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:17,438
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

412
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,568
Why, Eric, run away with you?

413
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:26,322
Oh, this is all so-- so sudden.

414
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,661
Daddy?

415
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:39,085
I consider myself
a reasonable merman.

416
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,924
I set certain rules, and I expect
those rules to be obeyed.

417
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:49,011
- But, Dad, I--
- Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?

418
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:53,766
- Daddy, I had to--
- Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

419
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,602
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

420
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:00,189
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

421
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:02,692
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

422
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,695
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

423
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:09,699
Spineless, savage, harpooning
fish-eaters incapable of any feeling--

424
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,867
Daddy, I love him!

425
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:14,620
No!

426
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:17,039
Have you lost
your senses completely?

427
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:20,584
- He's a human. You're a mermaid.
- I don't care.

428
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,839
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

429
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:28,801
And if this is the
only way, so be it!

430
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,348
Daddy! No!

431
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:37,018
No! Please!

432
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:40,813
Daddy, stop!
Daddy, stop it!

433
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:45,735
Daddy, no!

434
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:11,177
Ariel, I--

435
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:13,512
Just go away.

436
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:36,744
- Poor child.
- Poor, sweet child.

437
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:42,541
She has a very serious problem.

438
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,920
If only there were
something we could do.

439
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,923
But there is something.

440
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:53,636
Who-- Who are you?

441
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:56,055
Don't be scared.

442
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,308
We represent someone
who can help you.

443
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:04,480
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

444
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,565
Just imagine--

445
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:08,609
You and your prince--

446
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:13,114
Together forever.

447
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,121
- I don't understand.
- Ursula has great powers.

448
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:24,166
The sea witch?

449
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,545
Why, that's--
I couldn't possibly.

450
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,631
No! Get out of here.
Leave me alone!

451
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:33,926
Suit yourself.

452
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,263
That was only a suggestion.

453
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:51,444
- Wait.
- Yes?

454
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,781
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

455
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:58,284
It was an accident.

456
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,454
Ariel?
Where are you going?

457
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,248
Ariel, what are you doing
here with this riffraff?

458
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:07,501
I'm going to see Ursula.

459
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:10,338
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

460
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,008
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

461
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:18,888
But-- But, I--
Come on!

462
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,030
This way.

463
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:58,177
Come in.
Come in, my child.

464
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:03,516
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.

465
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,519
One might question
your upbringing.

466
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:12,066
Now, then, you're here...

467
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:17,113
because you have a thing for this human,
this, uh, prince fellow.

468
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:22,785
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

469
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:25,413
Well, angelfish...

470
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:30,376
the solution to
your problem is simple.

471
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:36,090
The only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.

472
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:37,717
Can you do that?

473
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:44,223
My dear, sweet child.
That's what I do.

474
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,350
It's what I live for:

475
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:50,688
to help unfortunate merfolk
like yourself...

476
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:55,651
poor souls with
no one else to turn to.

477
00:39:57,153 --> 00:40:00,531
<i>I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty</i>

478
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:04,243
<i>They weren't kidding when
they called me well, a witch</i>

479
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,663
<i>But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways</i>

480
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,124
<i>Repented, seen the light
and made a switch</i>

481
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:12,501
<i>True? Yes.</i>

482
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:16,422
<i>And I fortunately know
a little magic</i>

483
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:19,592
<i>It's a talent that
I aIways have possessed</i>

484
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:23,095
<i>And here lateIy, please don't laugh,
I use it on behalf</i>

485
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:26,182
<i>Of the miserable
lonely and depressed</i>

486
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:28,434
Pathetic.

487
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,687
<i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

488
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,940
<i>In pain, in need</i>

489
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,110
<i>This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl</i>

490
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:41,280
<i>And do I help them
Yes, indeed</i>

491
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:47,244
<i>Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true</i>

492
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,456
<i>They come flocking to my cauldron,
crying Spells, Ursula, please</i>

493
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:53,959
<i>And I help them
Yes, I do</i>

494
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:55,961
<i>Now it's happened
once or twice</i>

495
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:58,214
<i>Someone couldn't
pay the price</i>

496
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:02,551
<i>And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em across the coals</i>

497
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:04,637
<i>Yes, I've had
the odd complaint</i>

498
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:08,307
<i>But on the whole
I've been a saint</i>

499
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:13,354
<i>To those poor
unfortunate souls</i>

500
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,481
Now, here's the deal.

501
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,736
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

502
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:23,364
Got that? Three days.

503
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,200
Now, listen,
this is important.

504
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,661
Before the sun sets
on the third day...

505
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:33,165
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

506
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,168
That is,
he's got to kiss you.

507
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:41,674
Not just any kiss--
the kiss of true love.

508
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,428
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day...

509
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:49,515
you'll remain human
permanently.

510
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,060
But if he doesn't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid...

511
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:57,189
and... you belong to me!

512
00:41:57,356 --> 00:42:00,109
No, Ariel!

513
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:02,570
Have we got a deal?

514
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:07,742
If I become human, I'll never be
with my father or sisters again.

515
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,119
That's right.

516
00:42:10,286 --> 00:42:13,456
But you'll have your man.

517
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:18,878
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

518
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:25,051
Oh! And there is
one more thing.

519
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:27,720
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

520
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,805
You can't get something
for nothing, you know.

521
00:42:29,972 --> 00:42:32,350
- But I don't have any--
- I'm not asking much.

522
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:36,604
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

523
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:41,108
What I want from you
is your voice.

524
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:45,321
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

525
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:48,991
No more talking, singing.
Zip!

526
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:51,077
But without my voice,
how can I--

527
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:55,039
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

528
00:42:55,164 --> 00:43:01,170
And don't underestimate the importance
of body language! Ha!

529
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,131
<i>The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber</i>

530
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,759
<i>They think a girl
who gossips is a bore</i>

531
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:10,096
<i>Yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word</i>

532
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:13,474
<i>And, after all, dear what is idle prattle for
Come on, then!</i>

533
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:16,435
<i>They're not all that
impressed with conversation</i>

534
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,105
<i>True gentlemen avoid it
when they can</i>

535
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:22,358
<i>But they dote and swoon and fawn
on a lady who's with drawn</i>

536
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:24,819
<i>It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man</i>

537
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:28,781
<i>Come on, you poor
unfortunate soul</i>

538
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,784
<i>Go ahead
Make your choice</i>

539
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,870
<i>I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day</i>

540
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:37,790
<i>It won't cost much
just your voice</i>

541
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,126
<i>Ya poor, unfortunate soul</i>

542
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:43,129
<i>It's sad, but true</i>

543
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,673
<i>If you want to cross a bridge
my sweet, you've got to pay the toll</i>

544
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,010
<i>Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll</i>

545
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:51,303
<i>Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys</i>

546
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,141
<i>The boss is on a roll</i>

547
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:58,310
<i>This poor, unfortunate</i>

548
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:03,858
<i>Soul</i>

549
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:07,236
<i>Beluga, sevruga</i>

550
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:11,407
<i>Come winds of the Caspian Sea</i>

551
00:44:11,574 --> 00:44:15,119
<i>Larynxis, glossitis
Et maxlaryngitis</i>

552
00:44:15,244 --> 00:44:18,706
<i>La voce to me</i>

553
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:21,083
Now, sing!

554
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:29,925
Keep singing!

555
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:34,323
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

556
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,369
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

557
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:02,184
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

558
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:04,895
Look at ya. Look at ya.

559
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:08,274
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

560
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,068
I got it.
It's your hairdo, right?

561
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,195
You've been usin'
the dinglehopper, right?

562
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:18,284
No? No, huh?
Well, let me see.

563
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,286
New seashells?

564
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:25,458
No new seashells. I gotta admit
I can't put my foot on it right now.

565
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:28,627
- But if I just stand here long enough--
- She's got legs, you idiot!

566
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:33,049
She traded her voice to the sea witch
and got legs. Geez, man!

567
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,633
I knew that.

568
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,802
Ariel's been
turned into a human.

569
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,764
She's gotta make the prince fall
in love with her, and he's gotta k--

570
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,392
- He's gotta kiss her.
- And she's only got three days!

571
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:47,813
Just look at her!

572
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,942
On legs! On human legs!

573
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:55,154
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

574
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:58,366
What would her father say? I'll
tell you what her father'd say.

575
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:01,702
He'd say he's gonna kill himself
a crab! That's what her father'd say!

576
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:04,664
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now...

577
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,333
and tell him just like I
should have done the minute--

578
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,878
And don't you shake
your head at me, young lady.

579
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:13,798
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch...

580
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:15,800
to give you back your voice...

581
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:19,345
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be--

582
00:47:19,512 --> 00:47:22,932
Just be--

583
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,270
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

584
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,442
All right, all right.

585
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:37,530
I'll try to help ya
find that prince.

586
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:44,578
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

587
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:47,289
Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya.
If you wanna be a human...

588
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:50,459
the first thing ya gotta do is
dress like one. Now, let me see.

589
00:47:58,134 --> 00:48:02,847
Max? What?
Huh? What?

590
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,849
Max!

591
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:10,396
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.

592
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,785
Max!

593
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:27,371
Max!

594
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:29,957
Quiet, Max.

595
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:32,543
What's gotten
into you, fella? Oh.

596
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:36,255
Oh, I see.

597
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:39,425
Are you okay, miss?

598
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,802
I'm sorry if this
knuckle head scared you.

599
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:44,096
He's harmless really, uh--

600
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:50,895
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

601
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:57,777
We have met. I knew it. You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

602
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:01,113
What's your name?

603
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,783
W-What's wrong?
What is it?

604
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:10,122
You can't speak? Oh!

605
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,833
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

606
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:20,633
W-What is it?
Y-You're hurt?

607
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,469
No, no. You need help?

608
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:26,097
Whoa, whoa, careful!
Careful, easy.

609
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,351
Gee, you must have really
been through something.

610
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:32,561
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I'll help you.

611
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:34,563
Come on. Come on.
You'll be okay.

612
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:45,241
Washed up from a shipwreck.

613
00:49:45,408 --> 00:49:48,411
Oh, the poor thing.

614
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:51,747
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

615
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:58,629
I'll just-- I'll just
get this washed for you.

616
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,177
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

617
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,222
- No!
- Gertrude says--

618
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:10,725
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

619
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,727
- I mean, really.
- Madam, please--

620
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:16,230
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't
speak. Not my idea of a princess.

621
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:19,233
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of...

622
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,902
highly available ones right here.

623
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,208
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

624
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:40,046
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people...

625
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:43,507
in the middle of the ocean, and then
flitter off into oblivion like some--

626
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:46,135
I'm tellin' ya, Grim.
She was real.

627
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:49,347
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

628
00:50:49,472 --> 00:50:53,059
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

629
00:50:59,148 --> 00:51:03,069
Oh, Eric,
isn't she a vision?

630
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:06,113
Uh, you look wonderful.

631
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:09,283
Come, come, come.
You must be famished.

632
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,619
Let me help you, my dear.

633
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:15,289
There-- Oh, there we go. Eh,
that's better. Now, quite comfy, hmm?

634
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:17,416
Ha, ha. Good.
It's, uh--

635
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:22,004
It's, uh, not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

636
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:39,063
Uh, do you like it?
It-It is rather a fine one.

637
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:44,610
- Oh, my.
- S-Sorry, Grim.

638
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:49,323
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

639
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,951
Ah, very amusing.

640
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,245
Carlotta, my dear,
what's for dinner?

641
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:59,625
Oh, you're gonna love it! Chef's been
fixing his speciality: stuffed crab.

642
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:10,553
<i>Maurice Chevalier</i>

643
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,643
<i>How I love les poissons</i>

644
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,813
<i>Love to chop
and to serve little fish</i>

645
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:24,608
<i>First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones</i>

646
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:35,077
<i>With the cleaver
I hack them in two</i>

647
00:52:35,244 --> 00:52:38,164
<i>I pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried</i>

648
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,500
<i>God, I love little fishes
Don't you?</i>

649
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,171
<i>Here's something for
tempting the palate</i>

650
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:47,506
<i>Prepared in
the classic technique</i>

651
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,135
<i>First you pound the fish
flat with the mallet</i>

652
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,680
<i>Then you slash through the skin
Give the belly a slice</i>

653
00:52:54,805 --> 00:53:00,436
<i>Then you rub some salt in
'cause that makes it taste nice</i>

654
00:53:00,603 --> 00:53:05,149
- Oh.
- Zut alors! I have missed one.

655
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:07,360
<i>Sacre bleu
What is this?</i>

656
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:12,198
<i>How on earth could I miss such
a sweet little succulent crab</i>

657
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:15,451
<i>Quelle dommage, what a loss
Here we go in the sauce</i>

658
00:53:15,618 --> 00:53:18,412
<i>Now some flour
I think just a dab</i>

659
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:21,540
<i>Now I'll stuff you with bread
It don't hurt 'cause you're dead</i>

660
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,919
<i>And you're certainIy
lucky you are</i>

661
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,755
<i>'Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot</i>

662
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,970
Eh?

663
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,061
What is this? Ow!

664
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:48,651
Yeow!
Oh, ow, ow, oh!

665
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,802
I think I'd better go see
what Louie is up to.

666
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:20,891
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

667
00:54:21,017 --> 00:54:23,561
- Louie!
- Ow.

668
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:28,691
- What are you doing?
- Well, I-I-I was just, uh, uh, uh--

669
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:31,444
I'm sorry, madame.

670
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:35,990
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy...

671
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:38,659
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

672
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:40,661
Something in the way
of a tour.

673
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,789
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

674
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,917
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

675
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:50,296
Do something. Have a life.
Get your mind off--

676
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:54,508
Easy, Grim, easy. It's not
a bad idea, if she's interested.

677
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:56,802
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me...

678
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,180
on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

679
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:04,393
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

680
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,905
Come here, boy.

681
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:34,757
This has got to be,
without a doubt...

682
00:55:34,924 --> 00:55:39,345
the single most
humiliating day of my life.

683
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:44,892
I hope that you appreciate what
I go through for you, young lady.

684
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:49,021
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

685
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:54,151
Tomorrow, when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.

686
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:58,781
You gotta bat your eyes,
like this.

687
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:03,160
You gotta pucker up
your lips, like this.

688
00:56:14,255 --> 00:56:18,884
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?

689
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:23,097
Completely hopeless.

690
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,108
- Any sign of them?
- No, Your Majesty.

691
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:36,193
We've searched everywhere.

692
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,613
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

693
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,909
Well, keep looking. Leave no shell
unturned, no coral unexplored.

694
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:48,164
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

695
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,291
Yes, sire.

696
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:56,797
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

697
00:57:21,656 --> 00:57:23,824
- Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.

698
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:24,992
Oh!

699
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:31,582
Oh, Judy!

700
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,185
Yo! Flounder!
Any kissing?

701
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:53,729
No, not yet.

702
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:56,232
Hmm. Well, they'd--
they'd better get crackin'!

703
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:27,388
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

704
00:58:27,555 --> 00:58:32,310
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.

705
00:58:32,435 --> 00:58:37,648
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

706
00:58:37,773 --> 00:58:40,109
Okay, all right,
this calls for...

707
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:44,238
a little vocal
romantic stimulation.

708
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:46,240
Stand back!

709
00:58:52,788 --> 00:58:57,335
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

710
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:07,136
Oh! Geez, man.
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

711
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:13,017
You want something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

712
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:18,189
First we got to
create the mood.

713
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:20,191
Percussion.

714
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:25,112
Strings. Winds.

715
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,490
Words.

716
00:59:27,657 --> 00:59:30,493
<i>There you see her</i>

717
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,788
<i>Sitting there across the way</i>

718
00:59:33,954 --> 00:59:40,461
<i>She don't got a lot to say
but there's something about her</i>

719
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:43,923
<i>And you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try</i>

720
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,966
<i>You wanna kiss the girl</i>

721
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:48,719
D-Did you hear something?

722
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:51,555
<i>- Yes
- You want her</i>

723
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:55,309
<i>Look at her
You know you do</i>

724
00:59:55,476 --> 00:59:57,311
<i>Possible
she wants you too</i>

725
00:59:57,478 --> 01:00:01,649
<i>There is one way
to ask her</i>

726
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:03,776
<i>It don't take a word</i>

727
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:08,114
<i>Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl</i>

728
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,657
Sing with me now.

729
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:12,660
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my</i>

730
01:00:12,827 --> 01:00:16,956
<i>Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

731
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:21,085
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad, Ain't it a shame</i>

732
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:25,548
<i>Too bad
he gonna miss the girl</i>

733
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:27,842
You know, I feel really bad
not knowing your name.

734
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:31,887
Maybe I can guess.
Is it, uh, Mildred?

735
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:35,558
Okay, no.

736
01:00:35,725 --> 01:00:38,686
How about Diana?
Rachel?

737
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:42,773
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?

738
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:46,152
Ariel? Oh.

739
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:50,364
That's kind of pretty.
Okay. Ariel.

740
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:54,076
<i>Now's your moment</i>

741
01:00:54,243 --> 01:00:57,371
<i>Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

742
01:00:57,538 --> 01:01:00,041
<i>Boy, you better do it soon</i>

743
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:04,420
<i>- No time will be better
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

744
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:07,590
<i>She don't say a word
And she won't say a word</i>

745
01:01:07,757 --> 01:01:09,842
<i>Until ya kiss the girl</i>

746
01:01:12,553 --> 01:01:15,222
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared</i>

747
01:01:15,306 --> 01:01:19,352
<i>You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl</i>

748
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:21,937
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now</i>

749
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:25,483
<i>Don't try to hide it how
you wanna kiss the girl</i>

750
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:26,901
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

751
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:29,195
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along</i>

752
01:01:29,362 --> 01:01:31,197
<i>And listen to the song</i>

753
01:01:31,364 --> 01:01:33,949
<i>The song say kiss the girl</i>

754
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:36,702
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la-la
The music pIay</i>

755
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:40,998
<i>Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl</i>

756
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:43,501
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.
Kiss the girl</i>

757
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:47,004
<i>Why can't you
Kiss the girl?</i>

758
01:01:48,255 --> 01:01:52,218
<i>Go on and kiss the girl</i>

759
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:56,931
<i>- Go on and--
- Kiss the girl</i>

760
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:01,936
Whoa!
Hang on, I've got ya.

761
01:02:06,565 --> 01:02:08,234
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one.

762
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:11,779
Too close.
The little tramp!

763
01:02:11,946 --> 01:02:14,115
Ah, she's better
than I thought.

764
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:19,245
Well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.

765
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:24,041
Well, it's time Ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.

766
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:28,713
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.

767
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:32,174
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!

768
01:02:53,195 --> 01:02:56,282
Eric?
If I may say...

769
01:02:56,407 --> 01:03:00,494
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood...

770
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:05,791
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.

771
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:57,927
Ariel!

772
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:01,180
Ariel, wake up! Wake up!
I just heard the news!

773
01:04:01,347 --> 01:04:04,558
Congratulations, kiddo,
we did it!

774
01:04:04,725 --> 01:04:08,229
Ooh. What is this idiot
babbling about?

775
01:04:08,396 --> 01:04:11,065
Right, as if you two
didn't know, huh?

776
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,025
The whole town's buzzin'
about the prince...

777
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,529
gettin' himself hitched
this afternoon!

778
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:18,864
You know,
he's getting married.

779
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:23,035
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.

780
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,955
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!

781
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,305
Well, now, Eric.

782
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:45,933
It appears that
I was mistaken.

783
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:51,105
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.

784
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:54,025
A-And she is lovely.

785
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,527
Congratulations, my dear.

786
01:04:56,652 --> 01:04:59,488
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.

787
01:04:59,655 --> 01:05:03,576
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but,
these things do take time, you know.

788
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:07,330
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.

789
01:05:07,496 --> 01:05:12,460
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric,
uh, as you wish.

790
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,520
<i>What a lovely little
bride I'll make</i>

791
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:15,523
<i>My dear
I'll look divine</i>

792
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:22,530
<i>Things are working out
according to my ultimate design</i>

793
01:06:24,365 --> 01:06:30,871
<i>Soon I'll have that little mermaid
And the ocean will be mine</i>

794
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:38,921
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna-- I gotta--

795
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:41,841
Ariel!

796
01:06:41,966 --> 01:06:45,011
Ariel!

797
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:48,014
Ariel, I was flying--
I was--

798
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:52,727
Of course I was flying,
and I-I saw the-- the watch--

799
01:06:52,893 --> 01:06:55,563
The witch was watchin'
the mirror...

800
01:06:55,646 --> 01:06:58,024
and she was singing
with a stolen set of pipes.

801
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,818
Do you hear what
I'm tellin' you?

802
01:07:00,943 --> 01:07:06,282
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

803
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:09,535
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

804
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:11,620
I mean,
when it's important?

805
01:07:11,787 --> 01:07:14,206
What are we gonna do?

806
01:07:14,332 --> 01:07:18,002
Before the sun sets
on the third day.

807
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:27,845
Ariel, grab onto that.

808
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:31,223
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

809
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:33,225
I'll try!

810
01:07:33,351 --> 01:07:35,895
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

811
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,064
- Wh-What about me? What about me?
- You!

812
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:41,484
Find a way to
stall that wedding!

813
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:43,486
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I...?

814
01:07:43,653 --> 01:07:46,322
What...? That's it!

815
01:07:55,831 --> 01:08:00,002
Move it! Let's go!
We got an emergency here.

816
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:13,933
Dearly beloved--

817
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:19,355
Don't worry, Ariel.
We-We're gonna make it.

818
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:21,357
We're--
We're almost there.

819
01:08:21,524 --> 01:08:25,319
Yes, um, do you, Eric,
take Vanessa...

820
01:08:25,486 --> 01:08:28,614
to be your lawfully
wedded wife...

821
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:31,325
for as long as
you both shall live?

822
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:33,619
I do.

823
01:08:33,744 --> 01:08:35,621
It being--
And do you--

824
01:08:44,755 --> 01:08:45,965
Oh!

825
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,683
Then by the power--

826
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,852
Get away from me,
you slimy little--

827
01:09:12,074 --> 01:09:13,451
Oh, why, you little--

828
01:09:23,794 --> 01:09:26,672
Huh? Ahh. Huh?

829
01:09:35,473 --> 01:09:37,725
- Ariel?
- Eric!

830
01:09:38,893 --> 01:09:41,812
You-- You can talk?

831
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:45,024
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

832
01:09:45,191 --> 01:09:49,487
- It-It was you all the time.
- Oh, Eric, I-I wanted to tell you.

833
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:51,405
Eric, no!

834
01:09:53,324 --> 01:09:54,909
You're too late!

835
01:09:57,078 --> 01:09:59,246
You're too late!

836
01:10:06,629 --> 01:10:10,800
- So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!

837
01:10:10,966 --> 01:10:12,426
Poor little princess.

838
01:10:12,593 --> 01:10:15,429
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to--

839
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:18,766
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

840
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:24,188
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

841
01:10:24,313 --> 01:10:27,775
- Let her go!
- Not a chance, Triton! She's mine now!

842
01:10:27,942 --> 01:10:31,028
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I--

843
01:10:31,153 --> 01:10:34,573
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!

844
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:42,748
You see? The contract's legal,
binding and completely unbreakable...

845
01:10:42,873 --> 01:10:44,750
even for you.

846
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:50,381
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

847
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:55,720
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

848
01:10:55,845 --> 01:11:00,016
But I might be willing
to make an exchange...

849
01:11:00,182 --> 01:11:04,020
for someone even better.

850
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:07,356
- Eric, what are you doing?
- Grim, I lost her once.

851
01:11:07,523 --> 01:11:09,608
I'm not gonna lose her again!

852
01:11:09,734 --> 01:11:14,280
Now, do we have a deal?

853
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:19,910
Ha! It's done then!

854
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:24,999
No! Oh, no!

855
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:35,676
Your Majesty.

856
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:37,011
Daddy.

857
01:11:37,178 --> 01:11:41,599
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

858
01:11:46,228 --> 01:11:48,064
You!

859
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:51,567
- You monster!
- Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

860
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:54,570
Contract or no,
I'll blast-- Ow!

861
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:57,239
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

862
01:11:57,406 --> 01:11:59,241
After him!

863
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:08,793
Come on!

864
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:10,795
Ow!

865
01:12:13,089 --> 01:12:16,342
Say good-bye
to your sweetheart.

866
01:12:16,467 --> 01:12:18,260
Aah!

867
01:12:21,138 --> 01:12:25,810
Babies! My poor
little poopsies.

868
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:38,614
Eric, you've gotta
get away from here.

869
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:40,950
No, I won't leave you.

870
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:03,431
You pitiful,
insignificant fools!

871
01:13:03,597 --> 01:13:05,433
Look out!

872
01:13:07,268 --> 01:13:10,104
Now I am the ruler
of all the ocean!

873
01:13:10,271 --> 01:13:13,816
The waves obey
my every whim!

874
01:13:14,608 --> 01:13:16,485
Eric!

875
01:13:18,154 --> 01:13:23,743
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

876
01:13:42,553 --> 01:13:44,430
Eric!

877
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,134
So much for true love!

878
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:23,654
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

879
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:29,869
Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty.

880
01:15:30,036 --> 01:15:34,665
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

881
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,667
You always say that?

882
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:43,883
Then I guess there's
just one problem left.

883
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:46,093
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

884
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,764
How much I'm going
to miss her.

885
01:16:49,365 --> 01:16:51,033
Aha!

886
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:04,755
Yes! Thank you. Thank you.

887
01:17:14,765 --> 01:17:16,392
I love you, Daddy.

888
01:17:16,559 --> 01:17:20,688
<i>Now we can waIk
Now we can run</i>

889
01:17:20,855 --> 01:17:26,193
<i>Now we can stay
all day in the sun</i>

890
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:31,782
<i>Just you and me</i>

891
01:17:31,907 --> 01:17:36,287
<i>And I can be</i>

892
01:17:36,412 --> 01:17:42,960
<i>Part of your world</i>
