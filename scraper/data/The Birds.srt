00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,417
- Hello, Mrs MacGruder.
- Hello, Miss Daniels.

3
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:33,670
Have you ever seen so many gulls?
What do you suppose it is?

4
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,883
There must be a storm at sea.
That can drive them inland, you know.

5
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:41,170
I was hoping you'd be a little late.
He hasn't arrived yet.

6
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,421
- But you said 3.00.
- I know.

7
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:48,342
I know. I've been calling all morning.
You have no idea.

8
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:51,435
They are so difficult to get.
Really, they are.

9
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,557
We have to get them from India
when they're baby chicks, and then...

10
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:59,227
- This one won't be a chick, will he?
- Oh, no, certainly not.

11
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:02,402
- This will be a full-grown mynah bird.
- And he'll talk?

12
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:04,648
Well, yes, of course he'll...

13
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:08,108
Well, no, you'll have to teach him to talk.

14
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:12,329
I guess maybe I'd better phone.
They said 3.00.

15
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,868
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.

16
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,333
<i>- Would you mind waiting?
- Well, maybe you'd better deliver him.</i>

17
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:23,452
- Let me give you my address.
- Oh, well, alright,

18
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,121
but I'm sure they're on the way.

19
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,963
Would you mind if I called?

20
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,211
No. Alright.

21
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:51,154
<i>- I wonder if you could help me.
- What?</i>

22
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,406
I said, I wonder if you could help me.

23
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,946
Yes. What is it you're looking for, sir?

24
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,197
- Lovebirds.
- Lovebirds, sir?

25
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,661
Yes.
I understand there are different varieties.

26
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,909
- Is that true?
- Well, yes, there are.

27
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:12,663
These are for my sister for her birthday
and, as she's only going to be 11,

28
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,587
I wouldn't want a pair of birds
that were... too demonstrative.

29
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:19,002
- I understand completely.
- At the same time,

30
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:22,878
- I wouldn't want them to be too aloof.
- Of course not.

31
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:26,057
Do you happen to have
a pair of birds that are... just friendly?

32
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:30,057
Oh, I think so. Now, then, let me see.

33
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,181
Aren't those lovebirds?

34
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,231
No. Those are, uh... red birds.

35
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,528
<i>I thought they were strawberry finches.</i>

36
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,106
Yes. We call them that, too.

37
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,153
Here we are. Lovebirds.

38
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,829
Those are canaries.

39
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,202
- Doesn't this make you feel awful?
- Doesn't what make me feel...?

40
00:04:57,377 --> 00:05:01,125
Having all these poor, innocent
creatures caged up like this?

41
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:04,001
We can't just let them
fly around the shop.

42
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:06,048
I suppose not.

43
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:09,835
Is there an ornithological reason
for keeping them in separate cages?

44
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:13,630
- Certainly. It's to protect the species.
- Yes, that's important,

45
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:17,425
- especially during the moulting season.
- That's a particularly dangerous time.

46
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:20,556
- Are they moulting now?
- Some of them are.

47
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,431
How can you tell?

48
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,943
Well, they...
get a sort of hangdog expression.

49
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,445
Yes, I see.
Well, what about the lovebirds?

50
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,442
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to see a canary instead?

51
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:38,701
We have some very nice
canaries this week.

52
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,946
Alright.

53
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,363
Alright. May I see it, please?

54
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,962
Oh! Oh!

55
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,759
What is it? Oh! Oh!

56
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,222
<i>Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

57
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:09,762
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

58
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,688
<i>There we are.</i>

59
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:20,771
- Oh, there.
- Wonderful.

60
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:27,823
Back in your gilded cage,
Melanie Daniels.

61
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:32,206
- What did you say?
- I was merely drawing a parallel.

62
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:36,288
<i>- How did you know my name?
- A little birdie told me.</i>

63
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,951
Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

64
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,961
Hey, wait a minute. I don't know you.

65
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,624
- Ah, but I know you.
- How?

66
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:49,466
- We met in court.
- We never met in court or anyplace else.

67
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:52,592
- I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
- When?

68
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,842
<i>Don't you remember your practical joke</i>

69
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,809
that resulted in the smashing
of a plate-glass window?

70
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:00,809
<i>- I didn't break that window.
- Yes, but your little prank did.</i>

71
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,057
The judge should have put you
behind bars.

72
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,851
<i>- What are you, a policeman?
- I merely believe in the law.</i>

73
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,937
And I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

74
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:12,612
- What do you call your lovebird story?
- I really wanted the lovebirds.

75
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,365
You knew I didn't work here.
You deliberately -

76
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,611
<i>Right, I recognised you when I came in.</i>

77
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:21,072
I thought you might like to know what
it's like to be on the other end of a gag.

78
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:24,000
<i>- What do you think of that?
- I think you're a louse.</i>

79
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,287
I am. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

80
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:33,591
- I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds.
- I'll find something else.

81
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,668
See you in court.

82
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,181
- Who was that man?
- I have no idea.

83
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,284
They said the mynah bird
would be here later this afternoon

84
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,577
- if you'd care to come back.
- No, you'd better send him.

85
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,871
<i>- May I use this phone?
- Why, certainly.</i>

86
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:31,805
Daily News? It's Melanie Daniels.
Could you get me the City Desk?

87
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,133
<i>Just a minute, Mrs MacGruder.</i>

88
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,386
Hello, Charlie. Melanie.

89
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:38,934
I want you to do a favour for me.

90
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:41,182
No, this is a small one.

91
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:47,484
Pressure you? Why, Charlie, darling,
would I try to pressure you?

92
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:51,106
Would you call the Department
of Motor Vehicles for me?

93
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:55,861
Find out who owns this licence plate:
WJH 003.

94
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,528
Yes, a California plate.

95
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:02,917
No. I'll stop off in a little while.
Is Daddy in his office?

96
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,919
No, I don't want to break in on
a meeting. Tell him I'll see him later.

97
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,165
Thank you, Charlie.

98
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:18,052
- Do you have any lovebirds?
- Well, no, not in the shop,

99
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:21,508
<i>- but I can order them for you.
- How soon?</i>

100
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:24,969
<i>- Well, when would you want them?
- Immediately.</i>

101
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:29,189
<i>I could probably have them by tomorrow
morning. Would that be alright?</i>

102
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:31,645
That would be just fine.

103
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:25,360
- Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner?
- Yes.

104
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,736
<i>- He's not home.
- That's alright.</i>

105
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:30,860
He won't be back until Monday.
I mean, if those birds are for him.

106
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,493
<i>- Monday?
- Yes.</i>

107
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:35,068
<i>I don't think you should
leave them in the hall, do you?</i>

108
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,203
Well, where did he go?

109
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:40,208
Bodega Bay.
He goes there every weekend.

110
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,747
- Bodega Bay. Where's that?
- Up the coast.

111
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,619
- About 60 miles north of here.
- Sixty miles... Oh!

112
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:50,960
<i>It's 1½ hours by freeway, or two hours
if you take the coast highway.</i>

113
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:57,050
I'd look after them myself, but
I'm going away too. I'm awfully sorry.

114
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:48,767
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

115
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:51,611
- I wonder if you could help me.
- I'll try my best.

116
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,613
<i>- I'm looking for a Mitchell Brenner.
- Yeah.</i>

117
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:55,812
<i>- Do you know him?
- Yeah.</i>

118
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,315
<i>- Where does he live?
- Right here, Bodega Bay.</i>

119
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:02,157
- Yes, I know, but where?
- Right across the bay there.

120
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,202
Where?

121
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,831
- Now, see where I'm pointing?
- Yes.

122
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,505
<i>- See them two big trees across there?
- On the other side of the bay? Yes.</i>

123
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,091
<i>- And the white house?
- Yes.</i>

124
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:29,262
<i>- That's where the Brenners live.
- The Brenners? Mr and Mrs Brenner?</i>

125
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,807
<i>No, just Lydia and the two kids.</i>

126
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,979
- The two kids?
- Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.

127
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,145
Oh, I see. How do I get down there?

128
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:43,145
You follow the road around the bay,
and that'll take you to their front door.

129
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,073
The front door.
Is there a back road I can take?

130
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,195
<i>- No. That's the only road.
- You see, I want to surprise them.</i>

131
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,946
Oh?

132
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,907
<i>- I don't want them to see me arrive.
- Oh.</i>

133
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,369
It's a surprise, you see.

134
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,913
Well, you could get yourself a boat

135
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,251
<i>and cut right across the bay
to their dock.</i>

136
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,627
Where would I get a boat?

137
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:07,419
Down by the Tides Restaurant.

138
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:10,000
Did you ever handle an outboard boat?

139
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,419
Of course.

140
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:16,179
- Want me to order one for you?
- Well, thank you.

141
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,426
- What name?
- Daniels.

142
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,677
- OK.

143
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:37,526
- I wonder if you could tell me...
- Yeah. Hold it a minute, please.

144
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:41,485
...the little girl's name?
- The little Brenner girl?

145
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,739
<i>- Yes.
- Alice, I think.</i>

146
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:47,698
Harry, what's the Brenner girl's name?

147
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,035
<i>- Lois.
- Alice, isn't it?</i>

148
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:53,047
<i>- No, it's Lois.
- It's Alice.</i>

149
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:56,879
- Are you sure?
- Not positive, if that's what you mean.

150
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,878
I need her exact name.

151
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:02,966
Oh, uh... Just hold on
one more minute, please.

152
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,013
In that case, I'll tell you what you do.

153
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:10,556
Go straight through town till you see a
little hotel on your left. Turn right there.

154
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,223
<i>- Now, you got that?
- Yes.</i>

155
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,517
Near the top of the hill, you'll see
the school, and just beyond,

156
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,767
a little house with a red mailbox.

157
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:20,613
That's where Annie Hayworth,
the schoolteacher, lives.

158
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:24,064
<i>- Ask her about the little Brenner girl.
- Well, thank you.</i>

159
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:27,656
<i>Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Name's Alice for sure.</i>

160
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,575
Can I have the boat
in about 20 minutes?

161
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,663
<i>- How much for the phone calls?
- Oh, it's nothing.</i>

162
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,871
Thank you.

163
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,338
<i>- Who is it?
- Me.</i>

164
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,582
<i>Who's "me"?</i>

165
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,170
<i>- Miss Hayworth?
- Yes.</i>

166
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,671
<i>I'm Melanie Daniels.
I'm sorry to bother you, but...</i>

167
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,924
- Yes?
- The man at the post office sent me.

168
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,223
He said you could tell me the name
of the Brenner girl.

169
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,425
Cathy?

170
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,394
The one who lives
in the white house across the bay?

171
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:52,682
- That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
- He seemed sure it was Alice or Lois.

172
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:56,024
Which is why the mail never gets
delivered to the right place in this town.

173
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,862
- I'm sorry. Smoke?
- Thank you.

174
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:04,157
Did you want to see
Cathy about something?

175
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,943
Well, not exactly.

176
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,738
Oh.

177
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,864
Are you a friend of Mitch's?

178
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,249
No, not really.

179
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:20,416
I've been wanting a cigarette
for the last 20 minutes.

180
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,665
I just couldn't convince myself to stop.

181
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,248
This tilling of the soil
can become compulsive.

182
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:28,131
- It's a very pretty garden.
- Oh, thank you.

183
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:30,711
Well, it's something to do
in your spare time.

184
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:33,890
There's a lot of spare time
in Bodega Bay.

185
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,976
Are you planning on staying long?

186
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:39,220
No, just a few hours.

187
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,852
Then you're leaving after you see Cathy?

188
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:43,897
Well, something like that.

189
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,475
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to sound so mysterious.

190
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:51,195
- Actually, it's none of my business.
- Well, I'd better be on my way.

191
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,575
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

192
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,414
Did you drive up from San Francisco
by the coast road?

193
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,824
- Yes.
- Nice drive.

194
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:08,503
<i>- It's very beautiful.
- Is that where you met Mitch?</i>

195
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,962
Yes.

196
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,755
I guess that's where
everyone meets Mitch.

197
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,461
Now you sound a bit mysterious,
Miss Hayworth.

198
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,508
Do I? I don't mean to.

199
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,255
Actually, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.

200
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:27,768
- Or, rather, a closed one.

201
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:31,140
- Oh, pretty. What are they?
- Lovebirds.

202
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:35,942
I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.

203
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,187
Thank you.

204
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:41,822
- Can I get out this way?
- Go right around.

205
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:45,940
- It'll take you back to the main road.
- Thank you.

206
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:10,729
- Do you have a boat for Miss Daniels?
- Yes, ma'am. It's the one right below.

207
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:43,961
- Are you alright?
- I think so. What made it do that?

208
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,547
That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

209
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:50,675
It seemed to swoop at you deliberately.
Oh, you're bleeding, too.

210
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:53,890
Let's take care of that. OK? That's a girl.

211
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,314
Come on.

212
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,824
<i>What happened, Mitch?</i>

213
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:10,200
- Gull hit her.
- A gull?

214
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:17,121
Oh. Let's try up at the restaurant, alright?

215
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,453
- Might need a tetanus shot.
- I had a booster

216
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,457
before I went abroad last May.

217
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,149
- What happened?
- Hello, Deke. Young lady cut herself.

218
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:58,369
- Shall I call a doctor?
- I don't think it's that serious.

219
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:01,822
Helen, get some cotton and antiseptic.

220
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:06,749
- Um, you cut yourself outside, miss?
- Don't worry, Deke. She did it in a boat.

221
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,243
I had a man trip and fall
in the parking lot once.

222
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,963
Sued me before I could bat an eyelash.

223
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,668
I don't think Miss Daniels
is going to sue anybody.

224
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,465
Well, you're the lawyer.

225
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,508
Thank you.

226
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,545
- What's that?
- Just some peroxide.

227
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,798
I'll clean out the cut.

228
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,428
<i>- So you're a lawyer.
- That's right.</i>

229
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:31,770
Of course, I usually defend people,
but if I were prosecuting...

230
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,268
- Do you practise here?
- San Francisco. Why are you up here?

231
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,685
<i>- What kind of law?
- Criminal.</i>

232
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,270
Is that why you want
to see everyone behind bars?

233
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,858
Oh, not everyone.

234
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:46,318
<i>- Only violators and practical jokers.
- That's right.</i>

235
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:50,242
<i>- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. What are you doing up here?</i>

236
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:54,243
Didn't you see the lovebirds?

237
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:58,035
Oh, you mean, you came all this way
to bring me those birds?

238
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:01,166
To bring your sister those birds.
You said it was her birthday.

239
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,289
- Besides, I was coming up anyway.
- What for?

240
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:10,762
- To see a friend of mine. Careful.
- Oh, sorry.

241
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,473
Uh... who's your friend?

242
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,685
Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher.

243
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:18,928
Annie Hayworth.

244
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,312
Well, small world.

245
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:24,558
Yes.

246
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,394
How do you know Annie?

247
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,270
We went to school together. College.

248
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,275
Did you? Imagine that.

249
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:38,568
- How long are you staying up here?
- The weekend.

250
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:45,539
I think the bleeding's almost stopped.
Why don't you hold that on?

251
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:56,086
- So you came up to see Annie, huh?
- Yes.

252
00:28:56,261 --> 00:29:00,175
- I think you came up to see me.
- Why would I want to see you?

253
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,636
I don't know, but you must
have gone to a lot of trouble

254
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,884
to find out who I was
and where I lived.

255
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,180
It was no trouble at all.
I simply called my father's newspaper.

256
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:11,889
Besides, I was coming up anyway.
I've already told you that.

257
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:15,482
- You really like me, huh?
- I loathe you.

258
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,736
You have no manners.
You're arrogant and conceited.

259
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:22,238
I wrote you a letter about it, in fact,
but I tore it up.

260
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:25,824
- What did it say?
- None of your business.

261
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,117
I can't say I like your seagulls much,
either.

262
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:32,665
<i>- I come all the way up here to...
- You were coming anyway, remember?</i>

263
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:40,415
Mitch? I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?

264
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,045
- I had to acknowledge a delivery.
- A what?

265
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:46,253
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Melanie Daniels.

266
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,884
How do you do?

267
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,140
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Acknowledge a what?

268
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:54,597
<i>A delivery. Miss Daniels brought us</i>

269
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:56,927
<i>- some birds from San Francisco.
- Oh.</i>

270
00:29:57,104 --> 00:30:00,140
<i>- For Cathy's birthday. Where is she?
- Across at Brinkmeyer's.</i>

271
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,853
<i>Miss Daniels is staying here
for the weekend</i>

272
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:05,979
So I've already invited her
for dinner tonight.

273
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,905
You did go to the trouble
of bringing those birds.

274
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:15,076
<i>- I couldn't possibly.
- You did say birds?</i>

275
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:17,700
<i>Yes, lovebirds.</i>

276
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,948
Oh, I see.

277
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:26,041
<i>So we couldn't let you get away
without thanking you in some small way.</i>

278
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:28,288
And you haven't met Cathy,
and you are staying the weekend.

279
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:31,133
<i>- Well, yes, but...
- You are, aren't you?</i>

280
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,126
<i>- Certainly, but...
- Then it's all settled.</i>

281
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:36,302
- What time is dinner, Mother?
- 7.00, the same as usual.

282
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:40,089
- I'll pick you up. Where are you staying?
- With Annie, of course.

283
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:43,432
Oh, of course. How stupid of me.
A quarter to seven?

284
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,260
Annie may have made other plans.
I'll have to see.

285
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:48,974
<i>Besides, I can find my own way.</i>

286
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,520
You're sure now?
You won't hire a boat or anything?

287
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,728
<i>- I'm sure.
- Seven o'clock, then.</i>

288
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,820
<i>- Maybe.
- We'll be waiting for you.</i>

289
00:30:58,198 --> 00:31:01,234
<i>- How's your head?
- Much better, thank you.</i>

290
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,160
A gull hit me, Mrs Brenner, that's all.

291
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,248
- Oh, hi. Did you find her alright?
- Yes, I did.

292
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,632
I was wondering...

293
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,340
Uh, that sign there.

294
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:30,135
Do you suppose I could have the room
for just a single night?

295
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:32,135
I was planning on renting it
for a longer time -

296
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,770
I would appreciate it. I've tried
everywhere in town. They're all full.

297
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,809
Well, alright. Got your bags in the car?

298
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,058
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.

299
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,237
I just picked up some things
for the night at the general store.

300
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:52,281
- I hadn't planned on staying very long.
- Yes, I know.

301
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,989
Did something unexpected come up?

302
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,038
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

303
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,659
I just put some coffee on the stove.

304
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:08,462
- Don't they ever stop migrating?

305
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:05,087
Hi!

306
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,215
Hi!

307
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:11,008
<i>- Miss Daniels?
- Yes.</i>

308
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,058
Oh, they're beautiful!

309
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:17,977
They're just what I wanted.
Is there a man and a woman?

310
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:21,600
<i>- I cant tell which is which.
- Well, I suppose so.</i>

311
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:23,984
<i>- Hello. Annie had no plans, huh?
- No.</i>

312
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,814
We're very glad you could come.
Are you hungry?

313
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:28,487
- Reasonably.
- Dinner's just about ready.

314
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,816
We've been looking at the chickens.
Something seems to be wrong with them.

315
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:34,327
There's nothing wrong with the chickens.
I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer now.

316
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:37,367
What good's that going to do?
The chickens won't eat.

317
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,617
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

318
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:43,742
- Caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware.
- Whose side are you on?

319
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,753
- Merely quoting the law, dear.
- Never mind the law.

320
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:58,386
This won't take long, Miss Dan-
Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.

321
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,393
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I?

322
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:04,727
That feed you sold me is no good.

323
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,767
The chicken feed.
Well, it's just no good.

324
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:12,152
The chickens won't eat it.
They're always hungry.

325
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,523
I opened a sack for them when I got
home, and they just wouldn't touch it.

326
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:18,070
You know chickens as well as I do,
and when they won't eat,

327
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:21,408
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.

328
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:24,329
No, they're not fussy chickens.

329
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:28,492
Who? What's he got to do with it?

330
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,075
- Is that your father?
- Mm-hmm. Please sit down.

331
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:37,373
I don't care how many sacks of feed
you sold him. My chickens -

332
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,626
Oh, I see.

333
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,800
Dan Fawcett.

334
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:47,882
This afternoon? That proves what
I'm saying. The feed you sold us -

335
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:51,260
Oh.

336
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,979
Well, maybe I'd better
go over and see him.

337
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:00,098
You don't think there's something
going around, do you?

338
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:02,353
No, never!

339
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:06,740
No, they don't seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

340
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,691
Uh-huh.

341
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:14,361
Well, I'll try to go over and see him.
Maybe he -

342
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:17,283
Uh-huh. Alright.

343
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:20,243
Thanks.

344
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:27,381
He had a call from Dan Fawcett a while
ago. His chickens won't eat either.

345
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:31,049
It's what you said, Mom.
Mr Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

346
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,671
No, Cathy. He sold Mr Fawcett
a different brand.

347
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:38,798
You don't think they're getting sick,
do you, Mitch?

348
00:35:44,148 --> 00:35:46,852
I still don't understand
how you knew I wanted lovebirds.

349
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,934
Your brother told me.

350
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,569
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco?

351
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:54,948
<i>- Is that right?
- No, not exactly.</i>

352
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:59,492
Mitch knows a lot of people in San
Francisco. They're mostly hoods.

353
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:03,619
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.

354
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,240
He's spends half his day in the
detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

355
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:11,244
In a democracy,
everyone is entitled to a fair trial.

356
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,746
<i>- Your brother's practice -
- Aw, Mom, please!</i>

357
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:17,790
I know all that democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

358
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,510
He has a client now who shot his wife
in the head six times.

359
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,350
Six times! Can you imagine it?

360
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,349
I mean, even twice would be
overdoing it, don't you think?

361
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:33,890
- Why did he shoot her?
- He was watching a ball game on TV.

362
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:37,021
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.

363
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:43,565
- Are you coming to my party tomorrow?
- I don't think so.

364
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,073
<i>- I have to get back to San Francisco.
- Don't you like us?</i>

365
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,319
Oh, darling, of course I do.

366
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,448
<i>- Don't you like Bodega Bay?
- I don't know yet.</i>

367
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:56,073
Mitch likes it very much.
He comes up every weekend, you know,

368
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:59,287
<i>even though he has his
own apartment in the city.</i>

369
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:02,795
<i>He says San Francisco's
like an anthill at the foot of a bridge.</i>

370
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,040
I suppose it does get hectic at times.

371
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:09,925
Well, if you do decide to come,
don't say I told you about it.

372
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:11,720
It's supposed to be a surprise party.

373
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:14,925
<i>They've got this whole complicated
thing figured out,</i>

374
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,097
where I'm going to Michelle's and her
mother will say she has a headache,

375
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,595
<i>would I mind if she took me home.</i>

376
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,689
Then when I get home here,
all the kids'll jump out!

377
00:37:27,652 --> 00:37:32,313
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

378
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:35,483
I don't think so.

379
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:41,613
<i>- She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
- Hmm? Yes.</i>

380
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:44,031
<i>- Certainly pretty.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

381
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:47,790
- How long have you known her?
- I told you, dear, we met yesterday.

382
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:50,211
<i>- In a bird shop.
- In a bird shop.</i>

383
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,128
- She was selling birds?
- No. I just led her into believing

384
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,834
that I believed she was, and then...
It's all very complicated.

385
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:00,928
But she did buy the lovebirds
and then drove all the way here.

386
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,342
<i>- Mother.
- Yes?</i>

387
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:05,136
Where did you go to law school?

388
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:11,773
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just
naturally curious about a girl like that.

389
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:14,391
- She's very rich, isn't she?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

390
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:17,022
Her father's part owner
of one of the big newspapers.

391
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,360
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

392
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,479
- She's always in the columns, Mitch.
- Yes, I know.

393
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:29,403
She is the one who jumped into a
fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

394
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,782
- Yes.
- I supposed I'm old-fashioned.

395
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:35,744
I know it was supposed to be
very warm there, but...

396
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:38,670
Well, actually the newspapers
said she was naked.

397
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,913
Yes, I know, dear.

398
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,924
It's none of my business,
but when you bring a girl like that...

399
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:45,965
<i>- Darling?
- Yes?</i>

400
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:49,420
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

401
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:53,676
Well... as long as you know
what you want, Mitch.

402
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:57,306
I know exactly what I want.

403
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,434
Be able to find your
way back alright?

404
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,103
Oh, yes.

405
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:12,153
- Will I be seeing you again?
- San Francisco's a long way from here.

406
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:15,111
I'm in San Francisco five days a week
with a lot of time on my hands.

407
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,570
I'd like to see you. Maybe we could
go swimming or something.

408
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:20,822
Mother tells me you like to swim.

409
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:23,121
How does Mother
know what I like to do?

410
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:26,743
- We read the same gossip column.
- Oh, that. Rome.

411
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,042
I really like to swim.
We might get along very well.

412
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,965
In case you're interested,
I was pushed into that fountain.

413
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,374
- Without any clothes on?
- With all my clothes on.

414
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:37,468
The newspaper that ran that story
is a rival of my father's paper.

415
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,092
You were just a poor, innocent
victim of circumstances?

416
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm neither poor nor innocent.
The truth of that particular -

417
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,924
Truth is, you're running round
with a wild crowd.

418
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:48,268
Yes, that's the truth,
but I was pushed into that fountain.

419
00:39:48,438 --> 00:39:51,889
Uh-huh. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?

420
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:54,308
No. At least I didn't until I came up here.

421
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,192
- So you didn't go to school together?
- No.

422
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,903
- And you didn't come here to see her?
- No!

423
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:59,945
- You were lying!
- Yes, I was lying.

424
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,988
What about the letter you wrote me?

425
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,943
<i>- Is that a lie?
- No, I wrote the letter.</i>

426
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,573
- What did it say?
- It said, "Dear Mr Brenner."

427
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:10,244
"I think you need these lovebirds after
all. They may help your personality."

428
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:12,656
<i>- That's what it said.
- But you tore it up?</i>

429
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,660
<i>- Yes.
- Why?</i>

430
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,792
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

431
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:19,204
- Like jumping into a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!

432
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:23,378
- You don't expect me to believe that?
- I don't give a damn what you believe!

433
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,543
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?

434
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,261
I think it might be fun.

435
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:30,216
That might have been good enough
in Rome, but it's not good enough now.

436
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,670
<i>- It is for me.
- Well, not for me.</i>

437
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,387
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.

438
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,807
I want to go through life... jumping
into fountains naked. Good night.

439
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,532
- Miss Daniels, is that you?
- Yes.

440
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,287
Hi.

441
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:08,628
Is something wrong?
Is that cut beginning to bother you?

442
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:11,964
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

443
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:16,083
- Would you like some brandy?
- If you have some, I'd love it.

444
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:18,634
I'll get it. Why don't you sit down.

445
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:22,009
Oh, would you like a sweater
or something, a quilt?

446
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:24,260
No. No, thank you.

447
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:30,938
<i>- Won't you call me Melanie?
- Alright.</i>

448
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:39,941
Thank you.

449
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:46,070
Gets a bit chilly here at night sometimes,
especially if you're over near the bay.

450
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,866
<i>Well, how did your evening go?</i>

451
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,117
<i>Did you meet Lydia?</i>

452
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,962
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

453
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:58,205
I think so.

454
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:03,718
- Well, how do you like our little hamlet?
- I despise it.

455
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,971
I suppose it doesn't offer much
to the casual visitor,

456
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,093
unless you're thrilled by a collection
of shacks on a hillside.

457
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,473
It takes a bit of getting used to.

458
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:16,349
<i>- Where're you from originally?
- San Francisco.</i>

459
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:19,558
How did you happen to come up here?

460
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:25,686
A friend invited me up for a weekend
a long time ago.

461
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:30,447
Look, I see no reason for being coy
about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

462
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:33,321
<i>- I guess you knew that anyway.
- I suspected as much.</i>

463
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,537
Well, you needn't worry.

464
00:42:36,705 --> 00:42:38,781
Its been over and done with
a long time ago.

465
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:42,416
Annie, there's nothing
between Mr Brenner and me.

466
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:46,796
<i>Isn't there? Well, maybe there isn't.</i>

467
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,130
Maybe there's never been anything
between Mitch and any girl.

468
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,376
- What do you mean?
- I think I'll have some of that.

469
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:58,045
I was seeing a lot of him
in San Francisco.

470
00:42:58,224 --> 00:43:00,975
One weekend, he invited me up
to meet Lydia.

471
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:03,468
- When was this?
- Four years ago,

472
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:05,721
shortly after his father died.

473
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:10,057
<i>- Of course, things may be different now.
- Different?</i>

474
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:13,602
With Lydia.

475
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:16,945
<i>- Did she seem a trifle distant?
- A trifle.</i>

476
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:21,067
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

477
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:23,912
<i>You know, her attitude
nearly drove me crazy.</i>

478
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,569
When I got back to San Francisco,
I spent days

479
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:29,203
trying to figure out
what I'd done to displease her.

480
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:32,494
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.

481
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:37,295
I simply existed. So what's the answer?
A jealous woman, right?

482
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:39,292
<i>A clinging, possessive mother?</i>

483
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:44,175
Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus,
I don't think that was the case.

484
00:43:44,346 --> 00:43:46,671
Then what was it?

485
00:43:46,848 --> 00:43:50,263
Lydia liked me. That's the strange part.

486
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:52,593
Now that I'm no longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

487
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:57,098
- Then why did she object to you?
- Because she was afraid.

488
00:43:57,274 --> 00:44:01,816
- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd give Mitch.

489
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:03,361
I don't understand.

490
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:07,573
Afraid of any woman who would give
Mitch what Lydia can give him: Love.

491
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:10,943
That adds up to a jealous,
possessive woman.

492
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,194
No, I don't think so.

493
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:18,958
You see, she's not afraid of losing Mitch.
She's only afraid of being abandoned.

494
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:23,288
Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.

495
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:26,506
No. She already has a daughter.

496
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:31,631
Well, what about Mitch? Didn't he
have anything to say about this?

497
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:34,210
Well, I can understand his position.

498
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:37,057
He'd just been through a lot with Lydia
after his father died.

499
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:39,631
He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

500
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,885
<i>- I see.
- So, it ended.</i>

501
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:45,264
Not right then, of course.
We went back to San Francisco,

502
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,108
saw each other now and then,
but we both knew it was over.

503
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:52,771
- Then why are you in Bodega Bay?
- I wanted to be near Mitch.

504
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:56,444
<i>Oh, it was over and done with,
and I knew it, but...</i>

505
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:59,533
I still wanted to be near him.

506
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,618
<i>I still like him a hell of a lot,</i>

507
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:06,322
and I don't want to lose
that friendship, ever.

508
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,297
Hello.

509
00:45:18,676 --> 00:45:20,549
Hello.

510
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,008
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.

511
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,421
Yes, just a little while ago.

512
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,217
Sure. Hold on.

513
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,345
It's Mitch. For you.

514
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,070
Hello? Oh, yes, this is Melanie.

515
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,816
Fine, thank you.

516
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:51,859
No, no trouble at all.
I simply followed the road.

517
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:58,492
<i>There's no need to apologise.
I can understand -</i>

518
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:03,294
That's very kind of you.
No, I'm not angry.

519
00:46:06,925 --> 00:46:10,708
Well, I couldn't.
I have to get back to San Francisco.

520
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,964
No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but...

521
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,803
I see.

522
00:46:23,105 --> 00:46:25,430
<i>Alright. Yes, I'll be there.</i>

523
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:29,609
Good night, Mitch.

524
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:34,524
He wants me to go to Cathy's party
tomorrow afternoon.

525
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:37,485
<i>- I said I would.
- It should be fun.</i>

526
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,865
<i>I'll be there, too, to help.</i>

527
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:42,527
Oh, it seems so pointless.

528
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:46,654
Well, I think I'll go to sleep.
It's been a busy day.

529
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,456
My luggage.

530
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,088
That's pretty.
Where'd you get that? Brinkmeyer's?

531
00:47:02,514 --> 00:47:06,131
- Do you think I should go?
- Well, that's up to you.

532
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:10,760
No, it's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

533
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:14,388
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

534
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:16,309
Yes.

535
00:47:16,484 --> 00:47:19,235
- Then go.
- Thank you, Annie.

536
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,198
- Oh. Wonder who that can be.

537
00:47:24,365 --> 00:47:27,401
Is someone there? Who is it?

538
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,236
Look!

539
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:35,785
<i>Poor thing.
Probably lost his way in the dark.</i>

540
00:47:36,626 --> 00:47:38,832
But it isn't dark, Annie.

541
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,746
There's a full moon.

542
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:56,259
<i>Cathy, that's very good. Very good.</i>

543
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:58,510
<i>OK. Here we go.</i>

544
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:21,746
<i>Attagirl. Come on.
Don't let him get you.</i>

545
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:39,054
I really shouldn't have any more.
I'm driving.

546
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,636
Actually, I'm trying to get you to stay
for dinner. A lot of roast beef left over.

547
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:46,140
No, I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.

548
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,386
Alright.

549
00:48:48,562 --> 00:48:50,637
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

550
00:48:51,814 --> 00:48:55,728
Why do you have to rush off?
What's so important in San Francisco?

551
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:59,400
Well, I have to get to work
tomorrow, for one thing.

552
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:02,275
- You have a job?
- I have several jobs.

553
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:05,983
- What do you do?
- I do different things on different days.

554
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,567
- Like what?
- On Mondays and Wednesdays,

555
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:12,493
- I work for the Travellers' Aid.
- Helping travellers?

556
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:16,579
No, misdirecting them.
I thought you could read my character.

557
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:20,037
<i>On Tuesdays, I take a course
in General Semantics at Berkeley,</i>

558
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:22,289
finding new four-letter words.

559
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:24,837
- That's not a job, of course.
- You mean, you don't have to...

560
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:28,045
And on Thursdays,
I have my meeting and lunch.

561
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,340
- The underworld, I suppose.
- I shall disappoint you.

562
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:34,599
We're sending a little Korean boy
through school.

563
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:37,519
We actually raise money for it.

564
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,974
You see, Rome...

565
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:47,525
That entire summer, I did nothing but...

566
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:51,232
Well, it was very easy to get lost there.

567
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:54,775
<i>So when I came back,
I thought it was time I began...</i>

568
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:57,987
I don't know, finding something again.

569
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,659
So, on Mondays and Thursdays,
I keep myself busy.

570
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,868
- What about Fridays?
- Fridays? They're free.

571
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:13,756
I sometimes go to bird shops on Fridays.

572
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,335
I'm very glad you do.

573
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:21,007
- A nice, innocent, little day.
- Oh, yes.

574
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:27,636
I have an Aunt Tessa.
Have you got an Aunt Tessa?

575
00:50:28,188 --> 00:50:30,939
Mine is very prim and straight-laced.

576
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:34,606
I'm giving her a mynah bird
when she comes back from Europe.

577
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:38,359
<i>Mynah birds talk, you know.
Can you see my Aunt Tessa's face</i>

578
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:42,942
when this one tells us one or two
of the words I've picked up at Berkeley.

579
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:45,987
You need a mother's care, my child.

580
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:51,907
- Not my mother's.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

581
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:56,537
What have you got to be sorry about?

582
00:50:57,004 --> 00:50:59,210
My mother? Don't waste your time.

583
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:04,421
She ditched us when I was 11 and
ran off with some hotel man in the East.

584
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,428
<i>You know what a mother's love is.</i>

585
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:11,847
- Yes, I do.
- You mean it's better to be ditched?

586
00:51:13,976 --> 00:51:18,436
No. I think it's better to be loved.
Don't you ever see her?

587
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:27,354
I don't know where she is.

588
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:33,570
Well, maybe I ought to go
join the other children.

589
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:42,540
<i>Alright. Here we go. One...</i>

590
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:45,291
<i>two...</i>

591
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,044
<i>three.</i>

592
00:51:48,923 --> 00:51:50,998
There you go.

593
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,966
<i>Look! Look!</i>

594
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:05,926
Hey! No touching allowed!

595
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,180
<i>- Oh!</i>

596
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:37,956
Help me get the children into the house.

597
00:53:12,076 --> 00:53:14,152
There you go.

598
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,168
- Have they gone, Mitch?

599
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:23,959
- I think so.
- Is anyone hurt?

600
00:53:24,128 --> 00:53:26,797
Jenny got a scratch down
her cheek, but it's nothing.

601
00:53:26,964 --> 00:53:29,205
That makes three times.

602
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:35,084
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?

603
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:39,011
The gull when I was in the boat,
the one at Annie's last night -

604
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:43,346
- Last night? What do you mean?
- A gull smashed into Annie's front door.

605
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,390
- Mitch, what's happening?
- I don't know.

606
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:50,395
- Do you have to go back to Annie's?
- No. I have my things in the car.

607
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:55,394
Stay and have something to eat before
you start back. I'd feel a lot better.

608
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:08,407
<i>- Would you like some mustard?
- No, thank you.</i>

609
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,242
<i>Why didn't Annie stay?</i>

610
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,706
Said something about taking a call
from her sister in the East.

611
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,954
- What's the matter with them?

612
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,130
- What's the matter with all the birds?
- Where did you want this coffee?

613
00:54:18,299 --> 00:54:21,383
- Here on the table, honey.
- Hurry up with yours, Mitch.

614
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:23,959
I'm sure Miss Daniels
wants to be on her way.

615
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:27,054
<i>I think you ought
to stay the night, Melanie.</i>

616
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:29,761
We have an extra room
upstairs and everything.

617
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,222
That road can be
a pretty bad one at night.

618
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,059
If I go across to Santa Rosa, I'll come
out on the freeway earlier, won't I?

619
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,307
Yes, and the freeway is much quicker.

620
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,234
But she'll be hitting all the heavy
traffic going back to San Francisco.

621
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,817
<i>- Just listen to those lovebirds.</i>

622
00:54:44,988 --> 00:54:47,194
- Mitch.

623
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,377
Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!

624
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,567
That's a sparrow, alright.

625
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:27,403
- We know what it is, Al.
- Did you have a light burning?

626
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:30,694
Yes, but there wouldn't have been
that much light going up the chimney.

627
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:34,819
<i>Sometimes birds are attracted
by light. Sure is a peculiar thing.</i>

628
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:38,331
<i>Alright, but we've got
to do something about it!</i>

629
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:41,704
<i>I don't think I get you, Mitch.
Do about what?</i>

630
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:44,749
<i>Well, the birds invaded the house.</i>

631
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:47,212
<i>What's more likely,
they got in the room and just panicked.</i>

632
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:49,874
<i>I'll admit a bird will panic
in an enclosed room,</i>

633
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:53,172
<i>but they didn't just get in;
they came in, right down the chimney.</i>

634
00:56:53,347 --> 00:56:55,672
<i>My wife found a bird
in the back seat of the car once.</i>

635
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:57,925
Tell him about the party.

636
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,342
<i>We had a party here
this afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.</i>

637
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,189
<i>- How old is she?
- Eleven! In the middle of the party,</i>

638
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:05,846
<i>some seagulls came down at the children!</i>

639
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:08,811
<i>Miss Daniels was attacked
by a gull yesterday.</i>

640
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:11,736
<i>Yeah. Were the kids
bothering the birds or something?</i>

641
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:14,739
<i>If you make any kind of a disturbance
near them, they'll come after you.</i>

642
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:18,856
Al, the children were playing a game.
Those gulls attacked.

643
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,486
<i>Now, Lydia, "attack" is a pretty
strong word, don't you think?</i>

644
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:26,661
<i>I mean, birds just don't go around
attacking people without no reason.</i>

645
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:30,036
<i>The kids probably scared 'em, that's all.</i>

646
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:32,418
<i>These birds attacked.
You got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.</i>

647
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:39,503
<i>Maybe you ought to put some screen
on top of your chimney.</i>

648
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:43,675
<i>- You want help cleaning up?
- No. I can handle it.</i>

649
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:46,386
<i>It shouldn't be too much of a job.</i>

650
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,847
I'll take Cathy up to bed.

651
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:53,600
<i>- I think I should stay, don't you?
- It would be nice if you could.</i>

652
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:55,849
<i>My things are in the car.</i>

653
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:58,350
- Do you want to go with me?
- Alright.

654
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:03,070
<i>- Well, anything else I can do?
- No thanks, Al. We'll be alright.</i>

655
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,367
<i>- Good night, Lydia. Sure is peculiar.</i>

656
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:20,167
<i>Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!</i>

657
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:24,041
<i>- Yes, Mother?
- I'm going to drop Cathy off now.</i>

658
00:58:24,216 --> 00:58:27,050
<i>I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm.</i>

659
00:58:27,218 --> 00:58:29,294
<i>- OK.</i>

660
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,287
<i>Mornin'.</i>

661
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,543
Good morning, George. Is Mr Fawcett around?

662
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:20,137
I think so, ma'am. Ain't seen him this
morning, but he ought to be in there.

663
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:22,178
Thanks.

664
00:59:43,116 --> 00:59:45,986
- Dan, are you home?

665
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:37,578
Mother!

666
01:01:37,879 --> 01:01:40,833
What is it, dear? What's the matter?

667
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,876
Oh!

668
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:53,548
Al Malone, the deputy, just called.
He wants me over at the Fawcett place.

669
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:57,510
Some detectives from Santa Rosa
will be there. Will you be alright?

670
01:01:57,688 --> 01:02:00,724
Yes. I was just taking
your mother in some tea.

671
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:04,267
Oh, be careful, please.

672
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,945
And you be careful.

673
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,722
<i>- Mitch?</i>

674
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,311
No, it's me, Mrs Brenner.

675
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,614
- I thought you might like some tea.
- Oh. Thank you.

676
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:03,940
- Where's Mitch?
- Al Malone wanted him

677
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:08,116
- at the Fawcett farm.
- Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

678
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:10,780
He was calling from the farm.

679
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,747
- Then he saw.
- Oh, he must have.

680
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,161
<i>They sent for the Santa Rosa police.</i>

681
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:18,496
What good will they do?

682
01:03:21,884 --> 01:03:25,050
Do you think Cathy's alright
at the school?

683
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,296
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

684
01:03:29,516 --> 01:03:32,220
Do I sound very foolish to you?

685
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,469
Oh, no.

686
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,473
I keep seeing Dan's face.

687
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,484
And they have such big windows
at the school.

688
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,771
All the windows are broken
in Dan's bedroom.

689
01:03:45,946 --> 01:03:48,437
Try not to think about that.

690
01:03:49,407 --> 01:03:52,242
I wish I were a stronger person.

691
01:03:56,747 --> 01:04:00,198
I lost my husband four years ago,
you know.

692
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:07,124
It's terrible how you depend
on someone else for strength, and then...

693
01:04:07,298 --> 01:04:11,544
suddenly all the strength is gone,
and you're alone.

694
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:19,305
I'd love to be able to relax sometime.

695
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:22,382
I'd love to be able to sleep.

696
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:30,015
- Do you think Cathy's alright?
- Annie's there. She'll be alright.

697
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:36,188
I'm not like this, you know? Not usually.

698
01:04:36,364 --> 01:04:39,732
I don't fuss and fret about my children.

699
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,445
When Frank died...

700
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:51,750
You see, he understood the children.
He really understood them.

701
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:55,334
He had the knack of entering into
their world, of becoming part of them.

702
01:04:56,005 --> 01:04:58,922
<i>- That's a very rare talent.
- Yes.</i>

703
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:05,418
Oh, I wish, I wish,
I wish I could be like that.

704
01:05:08,558 --> 01:05:10,633
I miss him.

705
01:05:12,603 --> 01:05:15,556
<i>Sometimes, even now,
I wake up in the morning</i>

706
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,395
and I think,
"I must get Frank's breakfast."

707
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:25,061
And I get up, and there's a very
good reason for getting out of bed,

708
01:05:25,238 --> 01:05:27,776
until, of course, I remember.

709
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:35,571
I miss talking to him.

710
01:05:37,457 --> 01:05:40,162
Cathy's a child, of course, and Mitch...

711
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:44,702
<i>Well, Mitch has his own life.</i>

712
01:05:47,507 --> 01:05:51,670
I'm glad he stayed here today.
I feel safer with him here.

713
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:56,216
<i>- Would you like to rest now?
- No.</i>

714
01:05:56,473 --> 01:05:58,549
<i>No, don't go.</i>

715
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:05,101
I feel as if I don't understand you at all,
and I want so much to understand.

716
01:06:06,106 --> 01:06:08,395
Why, Mrs Brenner?

717
01:06:10,026 --> 01:06:13,525
Because my son seems
to be very fond of you.

718
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,731
And I don't quite know
how I feel about it.

719
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:23,160
I don't even know if I like you or not.

720
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:29,497
<i>- Is that so important, your liking me?
- Well, yes. I think so.</i>

721
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:33,243
Mitch is important to me.

722
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:35,959
I want to like whatever girl he chooses.

723
01:06:38,134 --> 01:06:40,209
And perhaps if you don't?

724
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:45,210
Well, then I don't think
it'll matter much to anyone but me.

725
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:47,929
I think it would also matter to Mitch.

726
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,304
Mitch has always done
exactly what he wanted to do.

727
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:03,070
But, you see...
I don't want to be left alone.

728
01:07:03,238 --> 01:07:06,986
<i>I don't think I could
bear to be left alone!</i>

729
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:09,234
<i>Oh, forgive me.</i>

730
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:13,621
Oh, forgive me. This business
with the birds has upset me.

731
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:17,240
I don't know what I'd do
if Mitch weren't here.

732
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:20,951
Why don't you try to sleep now,
Mrs Brenner?

733
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:24,163
I wish I were stronger.

734
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:30,009
Do you think she's alright?

735
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:33,178
Do you think she's alright at the school?

736
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:37,724
- Would you like me to go for her?
- Oh, I couldn't ask it.

737
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:41,343
- Oh, I don't mind, really.
- Would you?

738
01:07:42,313 --> 01:07:45,764
- I'd feel so much better.
- I'll go right now.

739
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:58,067
<i>Melanie?</i>

740
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:02,571

Please.

01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:21,881
We've got to get the children

01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:33,308
Now, quiet. Miss Daniels would like
to see how we conduct ourselves

01:12:33,476 --> 01:12:36,927
<i>- during a fire drill.</i>

811
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:40,555
I would like you to show her
how quiet and obedient you can be.

812
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,065
- Uh, we're going out of school now.
- Leave school?

<i>Home?</i>

815
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,818
I want the rest of you to go all the way
down to the hotel. Is that clear?

816
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,817
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

817
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:55,527
Melanie?

818
01:12:58,163 --> 01:13:00,654
I want you to go as quietly as possible.

819
01:13:00,832 --> 01:13:05,209
Don't make a sound till I tell you to run.
Then run as quickly as you can.

820
01:13:05,378 --> 01:13:09,209
- Now, does everybody understand?
- Yes, Miss Hayworth.

821
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,706
Alright, John, you lead the way.

822
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:49,538
Cathy! Cathy!

823
01:15:47,932 --> 01:15:49,806
Daddy, there were hundreds of them.

824
01:15:49,975 --> 01:15:54,269
No, I'm not hysterical. I'm trying to tell
you this as calmly as I know how.

825
01:15:56,064 --> 01:15:58,519
Alright, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.

826
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:01,811
Well, just now. Not 15 minutes ago.

827
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:06,820
At the school. No, I don't. Just a minute.

828
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:10,738
- What's the name of the school?
- Just the Bodega Bay School.

829
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:12,986
The Bodega Bay School.

830
01:16:14,038 --> 01:16:17,572
Well, I don't know
how many children - 30 or 40.

831
01:16:17,749 --> 01:16:22,042
No, the birds didn't attack until
the children were outside the school.

832
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,962
- Help you, Mrs Bundy?
- I need some change, Mr Carter.

833
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,206
Crows, I think.

834
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:31,331
I don't know. Is there a difference
between crows and blackbirds?

835
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:35,508
- There is very definitely a difference.
- Thank you.

836
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:38,765
They're different, Daddy.

837
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:41,092
Well, I think these were crows.

838
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:43,557
Well, yes. Hundreds of them.

839
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:47,561
Yes, they attacked the children.
Attacked them!

840
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:52,109
Well, I don't know when,
but I simply can't leave now, Daddy.

841
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,650
Alright. Yes. Good bye.

842
01:16:54,822 --> 01:16:58,902
They're both perching birds, of course.
But quite different species.

843
01:16:59,076 --> 01:17:01,317
The crow is Corvus Brachyrhynchos,

844
01:17:01,494 --> 01:17:04,495
and the blackbird
is Euphagus Cyanocephalos.

845
01:17:04,664 --> 01:17:08,577
Thank you. You have
the number at the Fawcett farm?

846
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,288
Right here in this book, miss.

847
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,952
I can't see that it makes
any difference, Mrs Bundy.

848
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,333
Crows or blackbirds, if the school
was attacked, that's pretty serious.

849
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,674
I hardly think that either species
would have sufficient intelligence

850
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:24,888
to launch a massed attack.
Their brainpans are not big enough to...

851
01:17:25,056 --> 01:17:29,385
I just came from the school. I don't know
anything about their brainpans, but...

852
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,050
Well, I do. I do know.

853
01:17:32,854 --> 01:17:36,187
Ornithology happens to be my avocation.

854
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:38,764
Birds are not aggressive creatures, miss.

855
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,813
They bring beauty into the world.
It is mankind, rather, who -

856
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:45,687
<i>Sam! Three southern fried
chicken. Baked potato on all of them.</i>

857
01:17:45,865 --> 01:17:48,403
Yes, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?

858
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,280
- Yes, I'll wait.
- It is mankind, rather,

859
01:17:51,453 --> 01:17:55,581
who insists upon making it difficult
for life to exist upon this planet.

860
01:17:55,749 --> 01:17:58,951
- Now, if it were not for birds -
- Mrs Bundy, you don't understand.

861
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:02,542
This young lady said there
was an attack on the school.

862
01:18:02,713 --> 01:18:04,123
Impossible!

863
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:06,669
Oh, Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.
Something terrible has happened.

864
01:18:06,841 --> 01:18:09,961
- It's the end of the world.
- Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

865
01:18:10,136 --> 01:18:12,294
What actually happened at the school?

866
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:14,677
Bunch of crows attacked the school kids.

867
01:18:14,848 --> 01:18:18,347
<i>It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God</i>

868
01:18:18,518 --> 01:18:23,096
unto the mountains and the hills,
and the rivers and the valleys."

869
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:26,806
"Behold I, even I
shall bring a sword upon you."

870
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:30,933
"And I will devastate your high places."
Ezekiel, chapter six.

871
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:33,318
<i>Woe unto them
that rise up early in the morning,</i>

872
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:35,565
that they may follow strong drink."

873
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:39,531
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.

874
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:43,534
I hardly think a few birds are going
to bring about the end of the world.

875
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:45,663
These weren't a few birds.

876
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:49,118
I didn't know there were many crows
in Bodega Bay this time of year.

877
01:18:49,294 --> 01:18:52,793
The crow is a permanent resident
throughout its range.

878
01:18:52,964 --> 01:18:55,834
In fact, during our Christmas count,
we recorded -

879
01:18:56,008 --> 01:18:58,581
<i>How many gulls
did you count, Mrs Bundy?</i>

880
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,595
<i>Which gulls, Mr Sholes?
There are several varieties.</i>

881
01:19:01,763 --> 01:19:03,802
The ones who've been playing devil
with my fishing boats.

882
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:06,808
- Have you had trouble with gulls?
- One of my boats did, last week.

883
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:09,680
This young lady was hit by a gull
only Saturday.

884
01:19:09,853 --> 01:19:13,186
<i>- I'm still waiting for the Bloody Marys.
- Coming right up.</i>

885
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:16,273
Could you ask them
to lower their voices, please?

886
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:18,518
They're frightening the children.

887
01:19:18,694 --> 01:19:20,769
A whole flock of gulls
nearly capsized one of my boats.

888
01:19:20,946 --> 01:19:22,737
Practically tore the skipper's arm off.

889
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:25,313
- You're scaring the kids. Keep it low.
- Alright.

890
01:19:25,491 --> 01:19:28,064
Yeah, but he's scaring me, too.

891
01:19:28,244 --> 01:19:31,244
Are you trying to say that all these...

892
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:34,621
Nah, that sounds impossible, Sebastian.

893
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:37,281
Deke, look, I'm just telling you
what happened to one of my boats.

894
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:42,584
The gulls were after your fish.
Really, let's be logical about this.

895
01:19:42,756 --> 01:19:46,089
What were the crows after at the school?

896
01:19:46,676 --> 01:19:49,001
What do you think they were after,
Miss uh...?

897
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:51,799
Daniels.
I think they were after the children.

898
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:56,135
- For what purpose?
- To kill them.

899
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:59,805
- Why?
- I don't know why.

900
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:03,892
<i>I thought not. Birds have been
on this planet, Miss Daniels,</i>

901
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:08,145
- since archaeopteryx, 140m years ago.

902
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,355
Doesn't it seem odd
that they'd wait all that time

903
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:13,606
to start a war against humanity?

904
01:20:13,782 --> 01:20:17,197
- No one called it a war.
- Scotch, light on the water.

905
01:20:17,368 --> 01:20:19,610
You and Mr Sholes seem
to be implying as much.

906
01:20:19,787 --> 01:20:21,863
<i>Who said anything about a war?
All I said, some gulls -</i>

907
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:25,289
<i>- Want some more coffee?
- No... came down on one of my boats.</i>

908
01:20:25,459 --> 01:20:28,128
They could have been after the fish,
just like you said.

909
01:20:28,294 --> 01:20:30,999
- The Captain should have shot at them.
- Huh?

910
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:34,256
Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are.

911
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:38,208
Get yourselves guns
and wipe them off the face of the Earth!

912
01:20:38,386 --> 01:20:41,221
- That would hardly be possible.
- Why not, Mrs Bundy?

913
01:20:42,014 --> 01:20:47,553
Because there are 8,650 species
of birds in the world today, Mr Carter.

914
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:53,480
It is estimated that 5,750,000,000
birds live in the United States alone.

915
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,725
The five continents of the world -

916
01:20:55,901 --> 01:20:58,308
<i>Kill them all. Get rid of the messy animals.</i>

917
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:01,522
...probably contain more than 100 billion birds.

918
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:05,315
- It's the end of the world.
- The gulls must have been after the fish.

919
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:08,778
<i>- Of course!
- Hurry up, children. Finish your lunch.</i>

920
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:11,029
Are the birds going to eat us, Mommy?

921
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:14,040
Hell, maybe we're all getting
a little carried away by this.

922
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,292
Admittedly, a few birds did act strange,
but that's no reason to believe that -

923
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:21,707
I keep telling you, this isn't a few birds.
These are gulls, crows, swifts -

924
01:21:21,881 --> 01:21:25,297
I have never known birds
of different species to flock together.

925
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:27,543
The very concept is unimaginable.

926
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,756
Why, if that happened,
we wouldn't have a chance!

927
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:33,053
<i>How could we possibly hope to fight them?</i>

928
01:21:33,224 --> 01:21:36,178
We couldn't, you're right.
You're right, Mrs Bundy.

929
01:21:36,352 --> 01:21:40,100
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- We're fighting a war.

930
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:42,893
- A war? Against who?
- Against birds!

931
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:45,224
I'm glad you all think this is so amusing.

932
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,192
You've frightened the children
half out of their wits.

933
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:51,193
If the young lady said she saw the attack
at a school, why don't you believe her?

934
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,151
<i>- What attack? Who attacked the school?
- Birds did. Crows.</i>

935
01:21:54,325 --> 01:21:56,614
You're all sitting around here debating!

936
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:59,573
<i>What do you want them to do next?
Crash through that window?</i>

937
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:02,581
- Mommy!
- Ssh. Put on your coat.

938
01:22:04,459 --> 01:22:08,373
Why don't you all go home,
lock your doors and windows?

939
01:22:08,546 --> 01:22:10,170
What's the fastest way to San Francisco?

940
01:22:10,339 --> 01:22:12,462
- The freeway, ma'am.
- How do I find it?

941
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:15,467
<i>I'm going out that way, lady.
You can follow me.</i>

942
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:19,051
<i>- Well then, let's leave now.
- Haven't finished my drink yet.</i>

943
01:22:20,097 --> 01:22:22,220
I got here as fast as I could.

944
01:22:22,391 --> 01:22:24,632
- Where's Cathy?
- She's with Annie. She's alright.

945
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,885
Al, why aren't you over at the school,
where the attack was?

946
01:22:27,062 --> 01:22:29,137
I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place.

947
01:22:29,313 --> 01:22:32,230
- He was killed last night by birds.
- What?

948
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,183
- Hold it, you don't know that for a fact.
- What are the facts?

949
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:38,852
The Santa Rosa Police
think it's a felony murder.

950
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,821
They think a burglar broke in and killed him.

951
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,231
How do they explain the dead birds
all over the floor?

952
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:46,694
Santa Rosa Police figure
they got in after the old man was killed.

953
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:50,737
Were the Santa Rosa Police
at your school today?

954
01:22:50,915 --> 01:22:53,406
- Are you coming?
- Now take it easy, lady.

955
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:56,122
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight!

956
01:22:56,295 --> 01:22:59,829
"Look at the birds of the air.
They do not sow or reap."

957
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:03,172
"Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them."

958
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:06,428
<i>Something like this happened
in Santa Cruz last year.</i>

959
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:09,512
<i>The town was just covered with seagulls.</i>

960
01:23:09,681 --> 01:23:13,049
- Please finish your drink.
- That's right, sir. I recall it.

961
01:23:13,226 --> 01:23:15,550
A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog,

962
01:23:15,728 --> 01:23:18,397
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.

963
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:21,517
They made some mess, too,
smashing into buildings and everything.

964
01:23:21,691 --> 01:23:23,767
<i>They always make a mess.</i>

965
01:23:23,943 --> 01:23:26,231
The point is that no one
seemed to be upset about it.

966
01:23:26,403 --> 01:23:30,566
They were all gone next morning, just
as though nothing at all had happened.

967
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,445
<i>- Poor things.
- I'm leaving! Are you coming?</i>

968
01:23:33,618 --> 01:23:35,694
Alright, alright!

969
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,951
Well, hope you folks figure this thing out!

970
01:23:40,123 --> 01:23:42,199
It's the end of the world!

971
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:45,282
I'd better get back to the cannery.
What do I owe you, Deke?

972
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,537
- Sebastian, hold it a minute.
- Huh?

973
01:23:47,713 --> 01:23:49,789
- I don't want to be an alarmist, but -
- No one ever said you were.

974
01:23:49,965 --> 01:23:52,538
I think we're in real trouble.
I don't know how this started, or why,

975
01:23:52,717 --> 01:23:54,840
but I know it's here
and we'd be crazy to ignore it.

976
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:57,928
- To ignore what? The "bird war"?
- Yes, the "bird war."

977
01:23:58,097 --> 01:24:00,173
The bird attack, plague -
Call it what you like,

978
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:02,721
they're massing out there someplace,
and they'll be back.

979
01:24:02,893 --> 01:24:04,766
- Ridiculous.
- Come here.

980
01:24:04,936 --> 01:24:08,850
Unless we do something right now, unless
we get Bodega Bay on the move, they -

981
01:24:09,023 --> 01:24:11,099
Look, Mitch.

982
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:14,477
Even if this is true, even if all the birds -

983
01:24:14,653 --> 01:24:18,484
- Don't you believe it's true?
- No, Mitch, frankly I don't.

984
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:21,229
- There's no reason I...
- It's happening. Isn't that a reason?

985
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:22,950
- I like Bodega Bay -
- Then help me!

986
01:24:25,704 --> 01:24:27,743
<i>You're an important man.
If you help, they all will.</i>

987
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:29,324
<i>- Help how? What do you want to do?</i>

988
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:31,491
<i>Mrs Bundy said something
about Santa Cruz.</i>

989
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,576
<i>About seagulls getting lost in a fog
and flying in towards the lights.</i>

990
01:24:33,752 --> 01:24:35,246
<i>We don't have fog
this time of year!</i>

991
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,128
<i>- Make our own fog!
- How do you figure to do that?</i>

992
01:24:37,297 --> 01:24:38,672
<i>We can use smoke pots,
the way the Army uses them.</i>

993
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,125
<i>- Look!</i>

994
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:47,377
They're attacking again.
Melanie, you stay in here. Come on, Al!

995
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:55,309
Look out!

996
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,834
Look at the gas.
That man's lighting a cigar!

997
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:33,338
Hey, you! Watch out!
Don't drop that match!

998
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:37,460
Get out of there! Mister, run!

999
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:40,993
Why are they doing this?

1000
01:28:41,587 --> 01:28:43,662
<i>Why are they doing this?</i>

1001
01:28:44,506 --> 01:28:49,582
They said when you got here,
the whole thing started!

1002
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:54,296
Who are you? What are you?

1003
01:28:54,473 --> 01:28:56,512
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

1004
01:28:57,851 --> 01:29:01,017
I think you're the cause of all this.

1005
01:29:01,187 --> 01:29:03,428
I think you're evil! Evil!

1006
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:08,023
Oh, God!

1007
01:29:13,322 --> 01:29:15,528
I think they're going!

1008
01:29:15,699 --> 01:29:18,190
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.

1009
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,345
- The crows again.
- Shh!

1010
01:29:58,318 --> 01:30:00,394
Come on.

1011
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:33,342
Oh, no. Stay here. Stay here.

1012
01:30:42,314 --> 01:30:45,018
<i>Cathy! Where's Cathy?</i>

1013
01:31:17,552 --> 01:31:19,628
Mitch, don't!

1014
01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:51,448
- Oh, don't leave her there, Mitch.

1015
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,791
Come on.

1016
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:58,043
- Shh.

1017
01:33:25,494 --> 01:33:29,989
When we got back
from taking Michelle home,

1018
01:33:30,164 --> 01:33:33,663
we heard the explosion and we went -

1019
01:33:33,834 --> 01:33:36,751
we went outside to see what it was.

1020
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,335
All at once, the birds were everywhere!

1021
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:45,000
All at once she pushed me inside

1022
01:33:45,177 --> 01:33:47,715
and they covered her!

1023
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:50,805
Annie... she pushed me inside!

1024
01:34:06,445 --> 01:34:08,852
Give me another one, darling.

1025
01:34:15,036 --> 01:34:17,787
How long have they been gathering there?

1026
01:34:17,955 --> 01:34:20,030
Oh, about 15 minutes.

1027
01:34:24,252 --> 01:34:26,825
Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?

1028
01:34:28,297 --> 01:34:32,294
They strike, then disappear,
and then start massing again.

1029
01:34:39,681 --> 01:34:42,137
Doesn't look so very different, does it?

1030
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:45,594
A little smoke hanging over the town,
otherwise...

1031
01:34:46,145 --> 01:34:48,221
You want to try your father again?

1032
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:50,473
No, I tried a little while ago.
The phone's dead.

1033
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,807
- Still got power, haven't we?
- Yes.

1034
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:56,104
<i>Mitch,
I'm getting something on the radio.</i>

1035
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:58,355
Come on.

1036
01:35:05,203 --> 01:35:09,532
I can't get any of the local
stations. I think this is San Francisco.

1037
01:35:09,707 --> 01:35:11,783
<i>" ... and the work
of a team of professionals."</i>

1038
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:14,449
<i>"In Bodega Bay early this morning,
a large flock of crows</i>

1039
01:35:14,628 --> 01:35:18,043
<i>attacked a group of children who were
leaving the school during a fire drill."</i>

1040
01:35:18,214 --> 01:35:21,713
<i>"One little girl was seriously injured and
taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa,</i>

1041
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:24,042
<i>but the majority
of children reached safety."</i>

1042
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:26,377
<i>"We understand there was
another attack on the town,</i>

1043
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,630
<i>but this information is rather sketchy."</i>

1044
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:33,218
<i>"So far, no word has come through to
show there have been further attacks."</i>

1045
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,849
<i>"
On the national scene today,
in Washington - "</i>

1046
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:38,891
- Well, is that all?

1047
01:35:39,691 --> 01:35:43,439
I'll have to get some more wood.
Mustn't let this fire go out.

1048
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:46,730
- Did you get the windows in the attic?
- Yes, I got them all.

1049
01:35:46,905 --> 01:35:49,277
- When do you think they'll come?
- I don't know.

1050
01:35:49,449 --> 01:35:51,655
If there are bigger birds, Mitch,
they'll get into the house.

1051
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:54,067
- It's a chance we'll have to take.
- Maybe we ought to leave.

1052
01:35:54,245 --> 01:35:56,118
No, not now!
Not when they're massing out there.

1053
01:35:56,288 --> 01:35:58,327
- When?
- We'll just see what happens.

1054
01:35:58,498 --> 01:35:59,957
- Where will we go?
- I don't know.

1055
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:02,081
I think we're safe here
for the time being. Let's get the wood.

1056
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:03,911
What happens
when you run out of wood?

1057
01:36:04,086 --> 01:36:05,711
I don't know!
We'll break up the furniture.

1058
01:36:05,879 --> 01:36:07,623
You don't know! When will you know?

1059
01:36:07,798 --> 01:36:11,795
When we're all dead!
If only your father were here...

1060
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mitch.

1061
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:25,059
Make yourself some coffee, won't you?

1062
01:36:38,407 --> 01:36:41,360
- Where are they heading?
- Somewhere inland.

1063
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,236
- Santa Rosa?
- Maybe.

1064
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,737
Come on. Let's get the wood.

1065
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,733
<i>Mitch? Can I bring the lovebirds in here?</i>

1066
01:37:27,907 --> 01:37:30,943
<i>- No!
- But, Mom, they're in a cage.</i>

1067
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:33,194
They're birds, aren't they?

1068
01:37:35,747 --> 01:37:39,281
Let's leave them in the kitchen,
huh, honey?

1069
01:38:25,956 --> 01:38:29,704
Mitch, why are they doing this, the birds?

1070
01:38:30,293 --> 01:38:34,670
- We don't know, honey.
- Why are they trying to kill people?

1071
01:38:34,839 --> 01:38:36,915
I wish I could say.

1072
01:39:52,905 --> 01:39:55,360
I'm sick, Melanie.

1073
01:39:57,784 --> 01:40:01,117
- I want to...
- I'll go with you.

1074
01:44:36,645 --> 01:44:38,721
They're going.

1075
01:45:49,915 --> 01:45:51,991
Mitch?

1076
01:48:52,445 --> 01:48:54,520
Oh, Mitch!

1077
01:49:06,832 --> 01:49:09,868
Get Cathy and Lydia out of here.

1078
01:49:11,252 --> 01:49:13,743
<i>Melanie! Melanie!</i>

1079
01:50:00,002 --> 01:50:02,540
Oh, poor thing! Poor thing!

1080
01:50:03,463 --> 01:50:06,583
Listen, get some water,
bandages and antiseptic. Quickly!

1081
01:50:06,758 --> 01:50:08,880
Bandages. It's terrible.

1082
01:50:11,929 --> 01:50:14,004
Cathy, get some brandy.

1083
01:50:25,232 --> 01:50:27,936
No, no, no! No, no, it's alright.

1084
01:50:28,109 --> 01:50:29,936
<i>No, it's alright.</i>

1085
01:50:30,111 --> 01:50:33,028
It's alright. It's alright. No.

1086
01:50:33,322 --> 01:50:35,812
<i>- No. Shh! Shh!</i>

1087
01:51:01,429 --> 01:51:03,505
Cathy, get the lamp.

1088
01:51:17,943 --> 01:51:22,106
- We've got to get her to a hospital.
- We can't. There's no place we can go.

1089
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,356
- There's San Francisco.
- We'd never make it.

1090
01:51:24,532 --> 01:51:26,608
We have to try.
We'll go by way of Bay Hill Road.

1091
01:51:26,784 --> 01:51:30,484
Then we don't have to go through town.
We can't stay here. She needs help!

1092
01:51:31,329 --> 01:51:33,452
I'm frightened. Terribly frightened.

1093
01:51:34,123 --> 01:51:37,077
<i>I don't know what's outside there.</i>

1094
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:41,746
We'd better get started
before another attack comes.

1095
01:51:41,922 --> 01:51:44,875
We'll take Melanie's car.
That'll be faster than the truck.

1096
01:51:45,049 --> 01:51:47,125
- Can you finish the bandaging?
- I'll try.

1097
01:51:47,301 --> 01:51:49,377
Alright.

1098
01:51:55,683 --> 01:52:00,012
<i>Mitch? See if you can get
anything on the car radio.</i>

1099
01:53:59,163 --> 01:54:01,451
<i>"The bird attacks have
subsided for the time being."</i>

1100
01:54:01,623 --> 01:54:04,327
<i>"Bodega Bay seems to be the centre,
though there are reports</i>

1101
01:54:04,501 --> 01:54:07,418
<i>of minor attacks on Sebastopol
and a few on Santa Rosa."</i>

1102
01:54:07,586 --> 01:54:10,338
<i>''Bodega Bay has been cordoned off
by roadblocks."</i>

1103
01:54:10,506 --> 01:54:12,581
<i>"Most of the townspeople
have managed to get out,</i>

1104
01:54:12,757 --> 01:54:15,295
<i>but there are still some
isolated pockets of people."</i>

1105
01:54:15,468 --> 01:54:18,552
<i>"No decision has been arrived at yet
as to what the next step will be,</i>

1106
01:54:18,721 --> 01:54:22,006
<i>but there's been some discussion
as to whether the military should go in."</i>

1107
01:54:22,182 --> 01:54:25,800
<i>"It appears that the bird attacks come in
waves, with long intervals between."</i>

1108
01:54:25,977 --> 01:54:28,598
<i>"The reason for this
does not seem clear as yet."</i>

1109
01:56:20,324 --> 01:56:25,115
- Did you hear anything on the radio?
- It's alright. Come on.

1110
01:57:03,193 --> 01:57:05,269
No. No!

1111
01:57:05,821 --> 01:57:07,896
Shh. Shh.

1112
01:57:35,763 --> 01:57:37,921
- Mitch?
- Shh!

1113
01:57:38,557 --> 01:57:40,632
Stay there.

1114
01:57:47,689 --> 01:57:50,227
Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch?

1115
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:54,729
- They haven't harmed anyone.
- Alright. Bring them.
