1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,626
The thing I've been
asking myself is,

2
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,930
what kind of sick individual
names a street Edgewood Way,

3
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,917
and he put it half a mile
away from Edgewood Lane?

4
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,712
Huh?

5
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,304
It's crazy.

6
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:19,723
You got me out here in this...
creepy, confusing ass... suburb.

7
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:25,569
Yo, I'm serious, though.
I feel like a sore thumb out here.

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,489
All right, baby.
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

9
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,740
See you.

10
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:35,523
Okay, so this is Rhine Ave.

11
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,045
It's like a fucking hedge maze out here.

12
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:52,010
East... Keep going straight and
then I think it said a left on a...

13
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,212
What was that? Peacock?

14
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,588
Go straight and a left on...

15
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,200
Okay.

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,202
All right,
just keep on walking, bruh.

17
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,104
Don't do nothin' stupid.

18
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,633
Just keep on...

19
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,924
Fuck this. I'm-ma fucking
go the other way I came.

20
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,782
Not today. Not me.

21
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:33,705
You know how they like to do
motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.

22
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,529
Yo, come on, brother, this is...

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,639
- Yo!
- Hey! Yo! Hey!

24
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,299
Sid, Sid, Sid.

25
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,723
How's it going over there?

26
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,304
Good.

27
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,320
You got your toothbrush?

28
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,108
Check.

29
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,310
Do you have your deodorant?

30
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,046
Check.

31
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,782
Do you have your cozy clothes?

32
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,496
Got that.

33
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,187
Can you give me a minute, Sid?

34
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,479
We gotta pry something
out of your dad.

35
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,236
What?

36
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,358
Do they know...
Do they know I'm black?

37
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,982
No.

38
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,421
Should they?

39
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:37,823
It seems like it's something you
might wanna, you know, mention.

40
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,828
"Mom and Dad, my black boyfriend
will be coming up this weekend

41
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,049
and I just don't want you to be shocked,
that he's a black man."

42
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,402
You said I was the first
black guy you ever dated.

43
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,403
Yeah, so what?

44
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,806
Yeah, so this is uncharted
territory for them.

45
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,875
You know, I don't wanna get
chased off the lawn with a shotgun.

46
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,210
You're not going to.
First of all,

47
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,047
my dad would've voted for Obama
a third time if he could've.

48
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,949
Like, the love is so real.

49
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,383
I'm only telling you that
'cause he's definitely

50
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,019
gonna wanna talk to you about that.

51
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,521
And it will definitely fucking suck.

52
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,548
But that's because he's a lame
dad more than anything else.

53
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,170
They are not racist.

54
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,133
- All right.
- I would've told you.

55
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,168
I wouldn't be bringing you home to them.

56
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,137
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Think about that for, like, 2 seconds.

57
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,271
I'm thinking.

58
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,348
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good.

59
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,554
No, no, no.

60
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,456
- Come on, I'm a grown man.
- No way.

61
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,498
You broke my cigarette.

62
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,027
Seriously, you just
threw it out a window?

63
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,596
Just like a dollar. You basically
threw a dollar out the window. Great.

64
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,565
That was a dollar you decided
to spend on nicotine.

65
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,933
- Yeah.
- Or tobacco.

66
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,534
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.

67
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,236
Oh, Rod.

68
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,176
Don't do that.

69
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,042
'Sup?

70
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,143
Yo, you at work?

71
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,544
Yeah, yeah, I'm at work.

72
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,114
Look, Chris, tell me this, okay?

73
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,282
How can I get in trouble

74
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,548
for patting down an old lady?

75
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,452
It's standard procedure.

76
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,955
Gary just think 'cause
an elderly bitch is elderly,

77
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,623
she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.

78
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,425
C, wait, wait, wait.
I know you laughing.

79
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,528
I'm serious, man. The next 9/11
is gonna be on some geriatric shit.

80
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,930
Straight up.

81
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,532
Look, man, thanks for looking
after Sid this weekend.

82
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,301
Remember, no human food.

83
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,903
He's got IBS.

84
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,304
Damn, C...
give me some type of credit.

85
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,372
- Okay, I don't forget shit.
- You do.

86
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,174
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

87
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,211
No, I accept your apology.
It's all good.

88
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,678
How Little Miss Rosie doing?

89
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,280
She's good. She's driving.

90
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,515
- Can I talk to him?
- No.

91
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,583
I'd like to talk to him, please.

92
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,020
Hold on, hold on.

93
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,521
- Hi, Rod!
- Now, look here.

94
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,956
You know you picked
the wrong guy, right?

95
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,359
Yeah, of course I know that.

96
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,292
This is all just a ploy to get to you.

97
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,028
- It's not too late for us.
- Okay, get your own girl.

98
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,529
Goddamn.

99
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,164
She's all mad at you 'cause
you never take my advice.

100
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,332
Like what?

101
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,567
Like don't go to
a white girl's parents' house.

102
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,237
What's she doing?
Licking your balls or something?

103
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,500
- Yeah, bye.
- You know what I'm saying, Chris?

104
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,048
Chris.

105
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,050
Chri...

106
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,669
This motherfucker hung up on me.

107
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,615
You're jealous.

108
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,584
I'm not jealous.
I made you jealous?

109
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,540
- I'm not jealous of Rod.
- It's Rod!

110
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,370
Fuck. Are you okay?

111
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,437
Yeah, that scared the shit outta me.

112
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,572
- You?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

113
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,639
All right.

114
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,995
Oh, my God.

115
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,987
Fuck.

116
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,662
- Stay here.
- What?

117
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,191
What are you doing?

118
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,438
I don't know.

119
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,077
Well, maybe he's gone, you know?

120
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,995
Chris.

121
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,854
So, in the future,

122
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:13,531
the number to call is
Animal Control Services.

123
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,702
Yes. Sorry about that.
I was just disoriented.

124
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,438
So you guys coming up from the city?

125
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,082
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,508
My parents are from
the Lake Pontaco area.

127
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,311
We're just heading up
there for the weekend.

128
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,280
Sir, can I see your license, please?

129
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,481
Wait, why?

130
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,583
Yeah.
I have state ID.

131
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,851
No, no, no.
He wasn't driving.

132
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:36,654
I didn't ask who was driving.
I asked to see his ID.

133
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,158
- Yeah why? That doesn't make any sense.
- Here.

134
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,260
No, no, no. Fuck that.
You don't have to give him your ID

135
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,528
'cause you haven't done anything wrong.

136
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,263
Baby, baby, it's okay.
Come on.

137
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,400
Any time there is an incident,
we have every right to ask...

138
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,442
That's bullshit.

139
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,145
Ma'am...

140
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,211
Everything all right, Ryan?

141
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,347
Yeah, I'm good.

142
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,754
Get that headlight fixed.

143
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,866
And that mirror.

144
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,457
Thank you, Officer.

145
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,701
What?

146
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,370
That was hot.

147
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,253
Well, I'm not gonna let
anyone fuck with my man.

148
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,317
- I see that.
- Okay.

149
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,498
We're here.

150
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,786
It's the groundskeeper.

151
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,515
Are you ready?

152
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,886
Hi!

153
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,355
My little girl! Come here!

154
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,358
- How are you?
- I love you too. I missed you.

155
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,893
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

156
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,495
Call me Mr. Armitage.

157
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,662
Of course.
How you doing?

158
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,765
I'm kidding! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

159
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,467
- How are ya?
- I'm good. How are you?

160
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,868
- We're huggers.
- Yes.

161
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,304
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

162
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,797
Hi, welcome.

163
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,841
Nice to meet you.

164
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,211
Your father gets really excited, but...

165
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,347
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

166
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,466
Yes. Come on in.
Please, welcome. Inside.

167
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,589
So how was your drive in?

168
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,326
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

169
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,927
- What?
- Oh, no.

170
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,529
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,497
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

172
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,633
Yeah. It just fruck us out.

173
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,900
It did?

174
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,636
Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

175
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,539
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

176
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,908
Frucking weird.
Well, you know what I say?

177
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,745
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

178
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,112
- Dean.
- Dad.

179
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,282
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

180
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,452
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

181
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,887
They're like rats.
They're destroying the ecosystem.

182
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,423
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

183
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,292
"That's a start."

184
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,593
I don't even understand that.

185
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,794
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just saying.

186
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,265
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

187
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,699
I don't like 'em.

188
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,800
We got that.

189
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,768
- Okay.
- Yeah.

190
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,305
All right, you guys look so wiped out.

191
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,574
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

192
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:47,122
So how long has this been going on?
This... this thang?

193
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,306
How long?

194
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,024
Four months.

195
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,652
Four months?

196
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,805
- Mmm.
- Five months, actually.

197
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,990
She's right, I'm wrong.

198
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,406
Attaboy.
Better get used to saying that.

199
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,062
Please, I'm so sorry.

200
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,391
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,334
See?

202
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,569
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

203
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,338
I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

204
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,972
- They just got...
- Can we unpack first?

205
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,681
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

206
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,880
This is Missy's office.
She takes appointments in there.

207
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,449
She's a therapist, right?

208
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,750
Psychiatrist, yeah.

209
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,951
Turns out people up here

210
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,886
are just as messed up
in the head as they are in the city.

211
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,488
This is Jeremy.

212
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,624
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

213
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,626
I've heard stories.

214
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,893
Yeah, I bet you have.

215
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,631
He's studying medicine now.
Wants to be just like his old man.

216
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,367
- You'll meet him.
- All right. Cool.

217
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,451
I picked these up in Bali.

218
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:52,644
It's pretty eclectic.
I'm a traveler and I can't help it.

219
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,514
I keep bringing souvenirs back.

220
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,751
It's such a privilege to be able
to experience another person's culture.

221
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,303
- You know what I'm saying?
- Mmm-hmm.

222
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,955
Oh, you're gonna love this.

223
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,057
My dad's claim to fame.

224
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,925
He was beat by Jesse Owens

225
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,663
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

226
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,665
- Those are the ones where...
- Owens won in front of Hitler.

227
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,099
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

228
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,904
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

229
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,541
This black dude comes along, proves
him wrong in front of the entire world.

230
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,809
Amazing.

231
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,378
Tough break for your dad though.

232
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,945
Yeah.

233
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,055
He almost got over it.

234
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,452
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

235
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,688
We got some black mold down there.

236
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,577
My mother loved her kitchen, so
we keep a piece of her in here.

237
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,062
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Rose's boyfriend.

238
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,104
Hi.

239
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,100
Hello.

240
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,969
The garbage goes under the sink,

241
00:17:51,970 --> 00:18:03,227
and now for the piece de resistance,
the field of play.

242
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,983
I love it.

243
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,970
The nearest house is across the lake.

244
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,649
It's total privacy.

245
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,433
I know what you're thinking.

246
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,500
What?

247
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,751
Come on, I get it.

248
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,479
White family, black servants.

249
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,641
It's a total cliche.

250
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,842
I wasn't gonna take it there.

251
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,680
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

252
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,480
No.

253
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,820
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

254
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,903
When they died,

255
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,758
I couldn't bear to let them go.
I mean...

256
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,022
But, boy, I hate the way it looks.

257
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,632
Yeah, I know what you mean.

258
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:59,637
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

259
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,929
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

260
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,569
- I agree.
- Yeah.

261
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,867
So what do your parents do, Chris?

262
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,820
Uh...

263
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,755
My dad wasn't really in the picture.

264
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,691
My mom passed away when I was 11.

265
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,826
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

266
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,094
A hit and run.

267
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,195
That's awful.

268
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,698
- Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
- You were young.

269
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,621
Actually, I don't remember
a lot from that time, so...

270
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,568
Well, that's okay.
We don't have to talk about that.

271
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,000
You smoke, Chris?

272
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:42,880
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,749
You jonesing a little bit
over there, huh?

274
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm quitting.

275
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,786
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

276
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,556
That's okay. We're not judging.
We're not.

277
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,015
That's a nasty habit, though.

278
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,102
You should have Missy
take care of that for you.

279
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,030
How?

280
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,364
Hypnosis.

281
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,212
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

282
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,203
Wow, um...

283
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,673
Some people don't want strangers
messing around in their heads, guys.

284
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,243
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

285
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,746
I smoked cigarettes for 15 years.

286
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,048
I loved every goddamn puff I took.

287
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,083
She puts me under once...

288
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,026
The sight of a cigarette
makes me want to vomit.

289
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,089
Okay, fall back, Dean.

290
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,242
It's a service we provide.

291
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,562
I'm good, actually.

292
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,796
Yes. Thank you, though.

293
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,731
Well, smoker or not,
we're thrilled to have you up here

294
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,600
- for the big get-together.
- Yeah.

295
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,602
Wait, holy shit.
That's this weekend?

296
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,736
Yes, this weekend.

297
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,237
- What get-together?
- Oh, my God.

298
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,039
Thanks, George.

299
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,342
It's Rose's grandfather's party.

300
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:48,646
My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

301
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,750
Get all his friends together,
bocce ball, badminton...

302
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,152
Wait, why didn't you guys
tell me about this?

303
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,354
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

304
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,256
- No, it's not.
- Um...

305
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,725
It is. Actually,
it is.

306
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,926
Is it really?

307
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,227
- Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
- Yeah.

308
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,331
We just kept it up because
after they died, it felt like...

309
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,300
We keep them close to us.

310
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,868
Yeah, they're still with us.

311
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,370
I just wanted to have a chill weekend.

312
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,038
Sounds like fun, actually.

313
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,683
Oh, Georgina.

314
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,644
I'm so sorry.

315
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,212
That's okay.

316
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,719
Why don't you go lay down?
Just get some rest.

317
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,755
Yes, I think I will.

318
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,179
Good.

319
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,330
My God, it must be very...

320
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,790
'Sup, fam!

321
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,767
Hey, Jer-Bear.

322
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,969
- Hi, darling.
- Hey, buddy.

323
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,157
Nobody answers the door around here?

324
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,707
Hey, Rosie.

325
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,875
Why would I lie, huh?

326
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,917
I love it!

327
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,148
Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

328
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,116
- What?
- Oh, my God!

329
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,179
She used to bite 'em off, suck on
'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.

330
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,223
No, I didn't.
I don't know what you're talking about.

331
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,692
That is so disgusting.

332
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,760
I fucking hate you.

333
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,327
Okay, here's a good one.

334
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:13,898
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

335
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,768
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

336
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,835
Conner Garfield.

337
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,103
No. Mom?

338
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,305
No, Jeremy, stop.

339
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,274
No, no, these are good.

340
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,441
I want to hear them.

341
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,377
Yeah, Rose, where are your manners?

342
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,680
Our guest wants to hear
the stories, please.

343
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,047
Thank you.

344
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,449
So Conner's from my lacrosse
team, right? Huge kid, like 6'3".

345
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,119
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

346
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,265
You threw a party.

347
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,924
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

348
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,326
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

349
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,294
Like 15 of us.

350
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,899
Oh, my God.
Tell me this isn't true, Rose.

351
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:47,773
Yeah.

352
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,803
I filled the liquor bottles
with water...

353
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,070
And let me finish?

354
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,439
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

355
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,412
So I'm upstairs hooking up with
the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

356
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,313
Oh, God.

357
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,917
You realize you're coming off as, like,
the world's biggest douchebag, right?

358
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,789
So Conner starts banging on
the bathroom door, right?

359
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,227
I open it and blood's gushing from
his mouth. And he's screaming,

360
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,930
"Your sister bit my fucking tongue off!"

361
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,765
- You bit him?
- What?

362
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,467
Okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss

363
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,403
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

364
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,206
It was a reflex.
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,776
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

366
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,144
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you better be careful.

367
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,480
Yeah, I'm very careful now.

368
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:42,001
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

369
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,128
So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

370
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,197
Basketball, mostly, I guess.

371
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,448
You an MMA fan?

372
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,267
Dude.

373
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,309
"Dude" what?

374
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,437
What?

375
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,458
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone
else have the floor for a second?

376
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,875
You're dating my sister, right?

377
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,984
He's dating my sister.
You had your chance.

378
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,789
I can't get to know the guy?

379
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,004
You mean like UFC?

380
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,794
Yes.

381
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,391
Nah, too brutal for me.

382
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,234
You ever get into
street fights as a kid?

383
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,237
I did judo after school, first grade.

384
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,371
- Aw...
- You should've seen me.

385
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,483
Judo?

386
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,512
'Cause with your frame and
your genetic makeup,

387
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:47,184
if you really pushed your body,
and I mean really train, you know?

388
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,657
No pussyfooting around.
You'd be a fucking beast.

389
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,125
Carrot cake!

390
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,584
- Ooh!
- Hi.

391
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,235
Carrot cake.

392
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,940
What did I miss?

393
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,935
A whole bunch of nothing.

394
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,871
Just talking about sports.
Right?

395
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,272
Yeah.

396
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,406
That sounds good.

397
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,671
So the thing about jiu-jitsu is

398
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,056
strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

399
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:24,021
It's a strategic game like chess.

400
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,049
It's all about being two,
three, four moves ahead.

401
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:32,880
Cool.

402
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,904
Stand up.

403
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,306
Jeremy, no karate at the dinner table.

404
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,507
It's not karate, Ma.

405
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,977
Yo, I got a rule.
No play-fighting with drunk dudes.

406
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,111
I don't play, I'm just...

407
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,431
Jeremy.

408
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,399
I wasn't gonna hurt him.

409
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,937
He was gonna put you
in a fucking headlock.

410
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,038
What is his problem?

411
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,407
He has never treated
any of my boyfriends that way.

412
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,641
Ever, ever, ever.

413
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,842
Mmm-hmm.

414
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,646
Oh, my God. And then my dad
with the "my man" stuff.

415
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,948
"My man, my man."

416
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,518
I don't think he's ever heard that
or said it. And now he just...

417
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,685
It's all he says.

418
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,087
Yup.

419
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,089
Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina?

420
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,450
What the fuck was that about?
That was so crazy.

421
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,230
I mean...

422
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,590
How are they different than that cop?

423
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,525
That's the fucking bummer of it all.

424
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,546
Mmm-hmm.

425
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,975
Mmm-hmm?

426
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,648
Anything more you'd like to add?

427
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,425
I told you so, like...

428
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,256
I didn't want to say it.

429
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,591
I didn't want to say it.
I didn't want to say that.

430
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,460
I don't like being wrong.

431
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,527
I've noticed that.

432
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,462
But I am sorry.

433
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,465
No, no, no. Wait.
Come here. Come here.

434
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm sorry.
This sucks.

435
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,070
What? Why you saying "sorry"?

436
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,438
'Cause I brought you here
and I'm related to all of them.

437
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,440
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

438
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

439
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,278
- Uh-huh.
- How are you so calm?

440
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,147
Honestly, it's nothing.

441
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,393
I like you on your racial flow, though.

442
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,419
- Is this a racial flow?
- Racial flow.

443
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,553
Am I feeling a racial flow?

444
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,360
Yeah, you're feeling racially flowy.

445
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,395
Oh, fuck.
The party.

446
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,507
How bad can it be?

447
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,243
They are so white.
Like, so white!

448
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,444
It's all good.

449
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

450
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,651
You know, with my genetic makeup,
shit gonna go down.

451
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,527
I'm a beast.
I'm a beast!

452
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,937
Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?

453
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,300
Yeah.

454
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,534
Come in and sit with me.

455
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,369
Please?

456
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,834
Just for a little while.
Please.

457
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,249
Thank you.

458
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,649
So you're comfortable enough, right?

459
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,351
It's perfect.
Thanks.

460
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,393
Sure.

461
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,338
You wanna know how it works?

462
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,744
You just dangle a pocket watch in
front of people's faces? Is that it?

463
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,842
You watch a lot of TV.

464
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,411
- When I was a kid.
- Uh...

465
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,453
Now you're feeling very sleepy.

466
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,984
We do use focal points sometimes

467
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,921
to guide someone into a state
of heightened suggestibility.

468
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,757
"Heightened suggestibility."

469
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,737
That's right.
That's right.

470
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,932
Do you smoke in front of my daughter?

471
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,703
I'm gonna quit.
I promise.

472
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,872
That's my kid.
That is my kid.

473
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,914
You understand?

474
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,628
What about your mother?

475
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,553
What about her?
Wait, are we...

476
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,394
Where were you when she died?

477
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,372
I don't want to think about that.

478
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,742
Home.
Watching TV.

479
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,763
Do you hear the TV?
What do you hear?

480
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,547
Rain.

481
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,006
Rain.
It was raining.

482
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,392
Hmm.

483
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,496
You hear the rain?

484
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,533
Mmm-hmm...

485
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,548
You hear it? Find it.

486
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,638
Tell me when you've found it.

487
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,983
Come here, Chris.
Look at me.

488
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,884
I found it.

489
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,552
Where was your mom?

490
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:49,967
She...

491
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,131
She was coming home and she wasn't home.

492
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,868
From work?

493
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,910
Hmm.

494
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,645
Hmm.

495
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,952
And what do you do?

496
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,090
Nothing.

497
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,693
Nothing.

498
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,656
I just sat there.

499
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,558
- You didn't call anyone?
- No.

500
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,600
Why not?

501
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,097
I don't know.

502
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,131
I just thought that if I did,
it would make it real.

503
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,746
Hmm.

504
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,765
You're so scared.

505
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,045
You think it was your fault.

506
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,916
How do you feel now?

507
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,486
I can't move.

508
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,064
You can't move.

509
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,524
Why can't I move?

510
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,101
You're paralyzed.

511
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:07,170
Just like that day when you did nothing.

512
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,076
You did nothing.

513
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,481
Now...
Sink into the floor.

514
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,530
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Sink.

515
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,047
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

516
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,953
'Sup, man?

517
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,790
They're working you good out here, huh?

518
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,319
Nothing I don't want to be doing.

519
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,386
Yeah.

520
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:12,082
I didn't get to meet you,
actually, up close. I'm Chris.

521
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,437
I know who you are.

522
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,310
She is lovely, isn't she?

523
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,230
Rose?

524
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,959
Yeah, she is.

525
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,946
One of a kind.
Top of the line.

526
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,443
A real doggone keeper.

527
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,056
Right.

528
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,408
Sorry about last night.

529
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,450
What?

530
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,377
My exercise.

531
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,461
I didn't mean to scare you.

532
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,885
Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,353
- And did it work?
- Did what work?

534
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,965
You were in Mrs. Armitage's
office for quite some time.

535
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,207
Oh, yeah.

536
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,897
Hmm?

537
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,866
I guess I had too much
of that wine last night.

538
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,598
Can't really remember.
Sorry.

539
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,104
Well, I should get back to
work and mind my own business.

540
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,939
I think your mom
hypnotized me last night.

541
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,513
What?

542
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,668
When?

543
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:42,974
I went out for some air last night,
and I run into her.

544
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,309
And I can barely remember anything,

545
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,701
but now the thought of a cigarette
makes me wanna throw up.

546
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,522
Oh, my God.

547
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:56,820
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she did that to you.

548
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,955
And I had some fucked-up dreams.

549
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,356
What'd you dream?

550
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,194
I was in a hole or something.
And I couldn't move. It was like...

551
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,262
Oh, God.
That sounds terrible.

552
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,374
I'm sorry.

553
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:13,036
Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?

554
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,805
What do you mean "his deal"?

555
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,240
I just talked to him.
Dude's whole vibe is hostile.

556
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,352
Did he say something?

557
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,471
It's not what he says.
It's how he says it, you know?

558
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,090
Hmm.

559
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,554
Maybe he likes you.

560
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,367
Maybe he's jealous or something.
I don't...

561
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,227
Are you fucking with me?

562
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,228
No.

563
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,879
So you think I've got a chance with him?

564
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,903
- All right, you got jokes.
- Put in a good word?

565
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,404
Great. No, funny.

566
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,007
I'm gonna talk to my dad about that.
That's not...

567
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,508
- No, don't talk to your dad.
- It's not cool.

568
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,477
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.

569
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,596
Forget about it.
It's done.

570
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,570
Okay.

571
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,325
Oh, boy.

572
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,448
Oh, man.

573
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,963
It begins.

574
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,630
Are you ready for this?

575
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:16,099
Yeah, I am.

576
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,141
I'm not.

577
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,150
- There they are.
- Oh!

578
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,041
- So nice.
- How are you?

579
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,910
- Just smile.
- Smile? All right.

580
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,978
How do you do that again?

581
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,946
Yeah, just smile the whole time.

582
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,578
Yeah, there you go.
There it is.

583
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,019
Oh, look, it's the Greenes.

584
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,320
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris.

585
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,189
Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene.

586
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,256
Chris. Nice
to meet you.

587
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,893
- Nice to meet you, Chris.
- Nice to meet you indeed.

588
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:43,994
Oh, that's quite a grip.

589
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,128
Thank you. You too, man.

590
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,030
You, uh, ever play golf?

591
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,233
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

592
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,203
Gordon was
a professional golfer for years.

593
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,504
Oh, you kidding?

594
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,440
Well, I can't quite swing
the hips like I used to, though.

595
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,475
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

596
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,344
Oh.

597
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,947
- Oh, that's great.
- Super.

598
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,248
Gordon loves Tiger.

599
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,649
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

600
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,551
Ever.
Hands down.

601
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,260
So, Chris, uh, let's see your form.

602
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,557
This is Nelson and Lisa.

603
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,092
Hey, how you doing?

604
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,529
So, how handsome is he?

605
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,509
I don't know, are you handsome?

606
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,368
Okay.

607
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,084
- Oh!
- Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

608
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,165
So, is it true?

609
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,413
Is it better?

610
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,455
Oh, wow.

611
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:40,350
Wow.

612
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:44,687
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years?

613
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,457
But now the pendulum has swung back.

614
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,367
Black is in fashion.

615
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,731
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

616
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,191
Sure thing.

617
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,532
- There he is.
- Oh!

618
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,421
Good to see another brother around here.

619
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,557
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

620
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,276
Something wrong?

621
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,327
There you are.

622
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,649
Do something with this.

623
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,550
Ah, yes, yes.

624
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,509
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

625
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,091
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

626
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,492
Fantastic.

627
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,201
You two make a lovely couple.

628
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,197
Thanks.

629
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,665
Oh, where are my manners?

630
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,701
Logan.
Logan King.

631
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,370
Chris was just telling me how he felt

632
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,418
much more comfortable
with my being here.

633
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,548
That's nice.

634
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:52,115
Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear,
but the Wincotts were asking about you.

635
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,435
Ah, mmm.

636
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,866
Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.

637
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,538
Goodbye.

638
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,362
What the fuck?

639
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,375
Ignorance.

640
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,300
Who?

641
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,701
All of 'em.

642
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:49,383
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

643
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,177
- Jim Hudson.
- Chris.

644
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,346
I know who you are.

645
00:46:56,347 --> 00:47:00,250
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

646
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:04,887
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

647
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:09,367
Believe me, the irony of being
a blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

648
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,628
How'd you do it?

649
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:17,003
My assistant describes
the work to me in great detail.

650
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,435
You've got something.

651
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:23,671
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

652
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,897
It's powerful stuff, I think.

653
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,645
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

654
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:34,517
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

655
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:39,789
I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.

656
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,759
I began dealing. Then, of course,
my vision went to shit.

657
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,728
Damn.

658
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,699
I know.
Life can be a sick joke.

659
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,302
One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

660
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,837
The next day, you wake up in the dark.

661
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,940
Genetic disease.

662
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,575
Shit ain't fair, man.

663
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,388
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

664
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:00,677
Hey.

665
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,022
Come here, come here.

666
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,310
What the fuck?
You left me out there.

667
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,011
Look at this.

668
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,848
She unplugged my phone.

669
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,149
Who?

670
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,052
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

671
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:19,622
So you think she did that because...

672
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,330
Maybe she doesn't like

673
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,869
the fact that I'm with you.

674
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,651
Really?

675
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,902
It's a thing.

676
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:36,757
So you are so sexy that people
are just unplugging your phone?

677
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,009
Forget it.
Never mind.

678
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,093
No, no, no. Stop, don't...

679
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,014
Don't do that.
Don't...

680
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,619
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's all good, all right?

681
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,533
They got you on display now, huh?

682
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,835
It's weird, man.
And it's the people here, too.

683
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,538
It's like they haven't met a black
person that doesn't work for 'em.

684
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,039
Yep, you're in it.

685
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,874
Also, shit...

686
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,609
I don't even wanna tell you.

687
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,651
What?

688
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,047
I got hypnotized last night.

689
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,350
Nigga, get the fuck outta here.

690
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,352
- No. Yo, yo.
- Yeah, to quit smoking.

691
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,787
But it's Rose's mom's
a psychiatrist, so...

692
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,657
Bruh, I don't care if the bitch
is lyanla Vanzant, okay?

693
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:30,793
She can't fix my motherfucking life.
You ain't getting in my head.

694
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,662
I know.
She caught me off guard, right?

695
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:37,667
But it's cool because I'm cured.
It worked.

696
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,935
Bruh, how are you
not scared of this, man?

697
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,071
Look, they could've made you
do all types of stupid shit.

698
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,807
They'd have you fuckin'
barking like a dog,

699
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,810
flying around like you're a fuckin'
pigeon, looking ridiculous, okay?

700
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,145
Or, I don't know if you know this,

701
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:52,186
white people love making
people sex slaves and shit.

702
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,951
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're not
a kinky sex family, dawg.

703
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,689
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating
the shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?

704
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,657
But that was after he fucked the heads.

705
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,559
Do you think they saw that shit coming?

706
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,827
Hell no.

707
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,762
Okay? They was coming over there like,

708
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,665
"I'm-ma just suck a little dick,
maybe jiggle some balls and shit."

709
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,701
No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit,

710
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,536
because their head was
off their fuckin' body.

711
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,571
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

712
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,440
It was fuckin' weird,
detached head shit.

713
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,201
You know, that's
Jeffrey Dahmer's business.

714
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:21,911
And thanks for that
image right there, man.

715
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,414
Hey, man, I ain't making this shit up.
I saw on A&E, man.

716
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,415
It's real life.

717
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,382
Yo, and it's the black people
out here, too.

718
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,718
It's like all of them
missed the movement.

719
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,202
'Cause they probably hypnotized.

720
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,591
Look, bruh, all I'm doing
is connecting the dots.

721
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,827
I'm taking what you
presented to me, okay?

722
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,063
I'm-ma tell you this. I think that mom
is putting everybody in a trance,

723
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,665
and she's fuckin' the shit out of 'em.

724
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:43,916
Thanks, Rod, bye.

725
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,943
- Hello.
- Fuck. Hi.

726
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,943
I owe you an apology.

727
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,929
How rude of me to have touched
your belongings without asking.

728
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,014
Oh...

729
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,717
No, it's cool.
I was just confused.

730
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:06,756
Well, I can assure you,
there was no funny business.

731
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,024
Allow me to explain.

732
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:13,763
I lifted your cellular phone
to wipe down the dresser,

733
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,131
and it accidentally came undone.

734
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,901
- Yeah, I told...
- Rather than meddle with it further,

735
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,707
I left it that way.

736
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,235
How foolish of me.

737
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,791
- It's fine.
- I wasn't trying to snitch.

738
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,221
Snitch?

739
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,539
Rat you out.

740
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,037
Tattletale.

741
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:39,609
Yeah.

742
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,874
Oh, don't you worry about that.

743
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,732
I can assure you,

744
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,294
I don't answer to anyone.

745
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,901
Right.

746
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,937
All I know is sometimes

747
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,577
if there's too many white people,
I get nervous, you know?

748
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,835
Oh. Oh!

749
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:29,690
No. No. No.

750
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,856
No, no, no, no.

751
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:36,720
Aren't you something?

752
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,583
That's not my experience.

753
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,650
Not at all.

754
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,782
The Armitages are so good to us.

755
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,294
They treat us like family.

756
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,167
This bitch is crazy.

757
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,303
The bitch is crazy.

758
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,156
Oh, hey, hang on. Chris.

759
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,292
Chris, I wanna introduce you
to some friends.

760
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:28,831
This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald
and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka,

761
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,950
and Jessika and Fredrich Walden.

762
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,072
Too many names to remember, but hi.

763
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,275
Do you find that being African-American

764
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:45,848
has more advantage or
disadvantage in the modern world?

765
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,890
Whoa!

766
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,241
It's a tough one.

767
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,278
Yeah, um, I don't know, man.

768
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,003
Hey.

769
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,229
Yo, my man.

770
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,331
They were asking me about
the African-American experience.

771
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:03,859
Maybe you could take this one.

772
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,669
Oh.

773
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,339
Well, well, I find that the
African-American experience

774
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,943
for me has been,
for the most part, very good.

775
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:17,046
Although I find it difficult
to go into detail,

776
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:21,851
as I haven't had much of a desire
to leave the house in a while.

777
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,352
We've become such homebodies.

778
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,687
Yes, yes.

779
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,958
But even when you go into the city,
I've just had no interest.

780
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,077
The chores have become my sanctuary.

781
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,012
Fucking shit.

782
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,284
Get out.

783
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,014
- Sorry, man.
- Logan.

784
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,684
- Get out!
- Yo!

785
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,385
- Yo, chill, man.
- Get out!

786
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,721
- Get outta here! Get outta here!
- Chill! Chill, man! Chill!

787
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,318
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Chill!

788
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,934
Seizures create anxiety
which can trigger aggression.

789
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,469
Yeah, but randomly
attacking other people?

790
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:16,138
It's not random.

791
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,402
You know, it was your flash.
That's what set him off.

792
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,877
- Hey.
- Well...

793
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,997
- How's he doing?
- He's much better.

794
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,286
I imagine that I owe you all an apology.

795
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,888
No, no, no.

796
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,758
We're just very happy
that you're yourself again.

797
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,226
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Hmm.

798
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,212
And I thank God for you
for calming me down.

799
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:45,300
I know that I must've
frightened you all quite a bit.

800
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,724
Especially you, Chris.

801
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,401
No. I'm sorry.

802
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,274
The flash. I didn't know.

803
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,744
Of course not.
How could you have?

804
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,967
And you shouldn't
have been drinking, either.

805
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,395
Yes.

806
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,216
Well, I'll have to let you all get on

807
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,906
the rest of the night without
the aid of my marvelous wit.

808
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,423
The whole ordeal has made me
quite a bit exhausted.

809
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,889
Logan, you just get some rest.

810
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,880
It was nice meeting you, Chris.

811
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,112
Yeah.

812
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,971
Something to lighten the mood?

813
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,340
Yes! Yeah, let's get this
party back on track.

814
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,369
How about sparklers and Bingo?

815
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,985
We're gonna go on a walk.

816
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,496
You sure?

817
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,461
Shall we?

818
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,490
My cousin's epileptic.

819
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,192
That wasn't a seizure, right?

820
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,796
My dad's a neurosurgeon.

821
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,964
And that's what he said it was.
I'm inclined to trust...

822
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,233
- That wasn't a seizure.
- What was it then?

823
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,620
How long have you known that guy?

824
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,411
I met him today.
Why?

825
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,323
Man, this is gonna sound weird,

826
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:07,639
but when he came at me,
it felt like I knew him.

827
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,354
Like you've met Logan before?

828
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,603
No, I don't know Logan.
I knew the guy that come at me.

829
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,503
I think your mom got in my head,
all right? I think she got in my head.

830
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:30,239
Yeah, and it worked, I thought...

831
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,408
No, it did not.
It didn't work.

832
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,044
She got in my head,

833
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:38,187
and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up
shit that I don't want to think about.

834
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,053
Like what?

835
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,611
I just need to go.

836
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,228
- You wanna go?
- Mmm-hmm.

837
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:08,554
Without me?

838
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,054
Whatever you want.

839
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,156
I told you about that night my mom died.

840
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,385
When I didn't call 911,
didn't go out looking for her.

841
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,662
Yeah.

842
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:41,762
One hour went by, then two,
then three, and I just sat there.

843
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,104
I was just watching TV.

844
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,011
There's nothing you could've done.

845
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:55,189
I found out later that, uh,
she had survived the initial hit.

846
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:05,440
She laid there bleeding by the side
of the road, cold and alone.

847
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,696
That's how she died in the
early morning, cold and alone.

848
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,511
And I was watching TV.

849
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,746
- There was time. There was time.
- You were just a little kid.

850
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,208
There was time.

851
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,349
There was time, if somebody
was looking for her.

852
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,578
There was time, but nobody,
nobody was looking.

853
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,131
You're all I got.

854
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:46,194
I'm not gonna leave here without you.
I'm not gonna abandon you, okay?

855
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,504
You're not?

856
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,345
No, no, I'm not.

857
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,121
Oh, my God.

858
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,627
You scared me.

859
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,335
Let's go home.

860
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,829
What?

861
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,886
Let's go home.
This sucks.

862
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,203
This sucks. Let's go home.

863
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,696
I'll make something up.

864
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,579
I love you.

865
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,285
I love you too, baby.

866
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,130
- Good night.
- Thank you.

867
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,415
Come on, sweetie.

868
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:53,800
Good night, Chris!
It was great to meet you.

869
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,652
Asshole.

870
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:05,540
Yo!

871
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,908
That's Dre.

872
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:07,942
Dre?

873
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:10,879
Andre Hayworth.
He used to kick it with Veronica.

874
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,181
Veronica from what?

875
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,612
Teresa's sister, that worked
at the movie theater on Eighth!

876
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,620
Yes, that is him!
That is him! But wait...

877
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,623
This is so fucking crazy!

878
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,625
Yo, he's different.

879
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,228
No shit.
Why's he dressed like that?

880
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,230
It's not that, it's everything.

881
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,832
He came to the party with a white
woman 30 years older than him.

882
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,369
Sex slave! Oh, shit!

883
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,037
Chris, you gotta get
the fuck up outta there, man!

884
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,208
You in some "Eyes Wide Shut" situation.
Leave, motherfucker.

885
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,375
Hello?

886
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,811
You gonna be a...
Hello? Chris?

887
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,692
Oh, shit. His battery
must've fuckin' died.

888
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,451
Hey, handsome.
Are you packing?

889
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,652
Rose, we gotta go.

890
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:51,868
We gotta go now.

891
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,323
- Okay.
- Okay.

892
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,457
Is everything okay?

893
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,792
I'll tell you in the car.
But we gotta go right now.

894
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,828
- Is that okay?
- Okay, yeah.

895
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,876
- Uh, let me go get my bag.
- Okay.

896
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,506
Okay.

897
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,311
Shit.

898
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,598
Hey, you ready?

899
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,501
Yeah, I'm just looking for my camera.

900
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,543
Uh...

901
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,139
It's right here.

902
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,375
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna
put the bags in the trunk real quick.

903
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:54,509
Okay.

904
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,612
Uh, yeah.
They are in here somewhere.

905
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,514
- It's just a matter of finding them.
- Yeah.

906
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,815
You okay?

907
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,351
Yeah. Yeah.

908
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,462
Okay.

909
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,078
Might take me a second.

910
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,491
Hey, uh...

911
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,959
What, you can't find those keys?

912
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,527
No. I can never find them.

913
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,962
Let's do this on the move.

914
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,004
Yeah.

915
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,804
- Chris?
- Just get the keys.

916
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,673
- Yo.
- Yo, man.

917
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,708
Where you going?
The party was just getting started.

918
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,577
Just putting the bags in the car, man.

919
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,412
Would anyone like tea?

920
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,813
Nah, I'm good.
We leaving, actually.

921
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,549
Really? Why?
Is something wrong?

922
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,985
Rose?
His dog got really sick.

923
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,658
So he has to be at the vet
first thing in the morning.

924
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,390
- Sick.
- Yeah.

925
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,779
Oh, how terrible.

926
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:46,003
- Rose, the keys.
- Looking.

927
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,741
Rose?

928
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,512
What is your purpose, Chris?

929
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:05,955
What?

930
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,536
In life, what is your purpose?

931
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,094
Right now, it's finding those keys.

932
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,161
Fire.

933
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,731
It's a reflection of our own mortality.

934
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:25,700
We're born, we breathe, and we die.

935
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,742
Rose?

936
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,645
I'm looking.

937
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,829
Even the sun will die someday.

938
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,172
But we are divine.

939
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,149
We are the gods trapped in cocoons.

940
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,677
Rose...

941
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,053
I don't know where they are.

942
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,755
Rose?

943
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,115
Rose! Rose, give me those keys!

944
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,526
Rose, give me...

945
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,828
Give me those keys.
Rose, now! Now, the keys!

946
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,766
Be careful, bro.

947
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,634
What the fuck?

948
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,135
I didn't do anything.

949
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,776
What the fuck is going on?

950
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,972
Where are those keys, Rose?

951
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:19,031
You know I can't give you
the keys, right, babe?

952
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:37,849
Come on.

953
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,183
Oh, shit.

954
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:51,920
- Is he hurt?
- Did you see him drop?

955
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,689
Yes, I did. Jeremy,
grab his legs, please.

956
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,558
Take him downstairs.
Dean, help him.

957
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,926
I can get him alone.

958
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,193
No, you can't.

959
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:00,562
You've already damaged him enough.

960
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:01,847
Okay, fine.

961
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,039
Okay.

962
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,717
- Ready?
- Mind his head. Please.

963
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,947
Easy.

964
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,114
You're gonna drop him.

965
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:21,683
No, I'm not.

966
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,384
You're not gonna
give me a little credit?

967
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,622
Okay, that was my fault.

968
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,966
You were one of my favorites.

969
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,996
- You hear that, Chris?
- Huh?

970
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,802
You're one of her favorites.
Chris?

971
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,692
Hey, it's Chris.

972
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,668
I'm either away from the phone or
I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

973
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,619
Chris!

974
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,881
Hey, it's Chris.

975
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,789
I'm either away from the phone or
I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

976
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,201
Yeah.

977
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,291
Me too.

978
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:38,359
...College Fund.

979
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,630
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

980
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,032
Millions of Americans
feel the effects of aging.

981
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,127
Oh, shit.

982
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:13,438
Oh, shit!

983
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:47,285
Is there anything
more beautiful than a sunrise?

984
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:53,161
Hi. I'm Roman Armitage.

985
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:57,799
And if you're watching this, you're
probably wondering what's going on.

986
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,868
There's no need to worry.

987
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,395
Let's take a walk.

988
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,142
You have been chosen because
of the physical advantages

989
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,879
you've enjoyed your entire lifetime.

990
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,282
With your natural gifts
and our determination,

991
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,218
we could both be
part of something greater.

992
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,232
Something perfect.

993
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:29,230
The Coagula procedure
is a man-made miracle.

994
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:33,367
Our order has been developing
it for many, many years,

995
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:42,376
and it wasn't until recently it was
perfected by my own flesh and blood.

996
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:49,217
My family and I are honored to offer it
as a service to members of our group.

997
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:51,986
Don't waste your strength,
don't try to fight it.

998
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:56,925
You can't stop the inevitable.
And who knows?

999
01:14:56,926 --> 01:15:03,035
Maybe one day, you'll enjoy
being members of the family.

1000
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,563
Behold,

1001
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,932
the Coagula.

1002
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,444
What the fuck?

1003
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,436
Hello, Mr...

1004
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:45,173
Uh,
Williams. Rod Williams.

1005
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:46,274
From the TSA?

1006
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,489
Yes, ma'am.

1007
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,580
You know all TSA issues should be
brought up with your authorizing officer.

1008
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:54,916
Yes, ma'am, but this
is not TSA business.

1009
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:58,423
Okay, don't call me "ma'am."
Otherwise we're not gonna get along.

1010
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,456
How can I help you,
Rod Williams from the TSA?

1011
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,159
- All right, here it is.
- Mmm.

1012
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,646
My boy, Chris, has been
missing for two days.

1013
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,398
Your son is missing?

1014
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,435
Oh, no. Not my son, my friend. He's 26.

1015
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,554
His name is Chris Washington.

1016
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,407
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

1017
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,388
She's white.

1018
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:30,384
All right.
Go on.

1019
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,620
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

1020
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,329
And I've been watching his dog, Sid.

1021
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,358
That's Sid.

1022
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,493
Cute, right?

1023
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:43,197
So Chris sent this to me from
his girlfriend's parents' house.

1024
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,099
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

1025
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,201
Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

1026
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:51,539
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

1027
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,607
Well, he don't look so missing to me.

1028
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:55,944
That's 'cause we found him, right?

1029
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,979
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

1030
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,113
Different how?

1031
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,548
This dude is from Brooklyn.

1032
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:02,616
Huh? He didn't dress like this.

1033
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:04,652
I didn't use to dress like this.

1034
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:07,388
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

1035
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,634
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

1036
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,395
Oh, Lord! Rod Williams from the TSA.

1037
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,463
I know, I know, I know.

1038
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,132
Okay, I'm trying to work towards this.

1039
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,634
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

1040
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:22,302
- You ready?
- All right.

1041
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,705
Try me.

1042
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,675
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

1043
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:32,013
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.

1044
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,157
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

1045
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:34,723
Sorry.

1046
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,690
Hold on a second.

1047
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,525
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

1048
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,160
"Oh, man, that's Andre Hayworth."

1049
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,461
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

1050
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:50,031
So I do all my research, you know,
'cause as a TSA agent...

1051
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,400
You guys are detectives?
I got the same training, you know?

1052
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,202
We might know more than y'all sometimes.

1053
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,137
'Cause we dealing with
some terrorist shit, so...

1054
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,405
But that's a totally different story.

1055
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,208
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

1056
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:02,243
And I start putting pieces together.

1057
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,877
And, see, this is what I came up with.

1058
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:08,482
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

1059
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:12,220
Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves,
but sex slaves and shit.

1060
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:17,725
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

1061
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,129
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

1062
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,697
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

1063
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,642
What's the next move?

1064
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:40,390
And don't ever, ever say that
I don't do nothin' for you.

1065
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:47,621
Oh! White girls.
Oh, they get you every time.

1066
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:48,663
Oh!

1067
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,604
Magic ain't real.

1068
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,376
None of this shit makes sense.

1069
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:13,788
Hello?

1070
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,284
Chris?

1071
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:17,285
Yo, um...

1072
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:21,555
Hey, what up? Rose, it's me, Rod.

1073
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:22,597
Hi.

1074
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,302
Where's Chris?

1075
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,130
He left two days ago.

1076
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:30,564
He left?

1077
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:34,868
Yeah. He got all paranoid,
and then he freaked out on me.

1078
01:19:34,869 --> 01:19:38,772
And then he just got
in a cab and left his phone.

1079
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:41,342
Wait.
You haven't seen him?

1080
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,377
No, he never came back here.

1081
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,813
Oh, my God.

1082
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:49,183
Look, look, I've been calling
his phone a bunch of times.

1083
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,779
Matter of fact, I went to the police.

1084
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,621
What did you say?

1085
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,189
I just said he was missing.

1086
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,446
Oh, good. Uh...

1087
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,412
Let me ask you something.

1088
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:05,399
What cab company did he,
uh, use to leave?

1089
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,601
Oh, gosh.

1090
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:10,904
I don't know.
I guess maybe a local one.

1091
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:14,375
Or I guess he could've called an Uber?

1092
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,944
Um, wait.
I'm so confused.

1093
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,158
Oh, you confused? Okay.

1094
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,483
You know something? Me too.

1095
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,218
- Could you hold on one second?
- Okay.

1096
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:25,434
Okay. Hold on.

1097
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,659
You lying bitch. She is lying like
a motherfucker. I know that...

1098
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,992
Ooh, that TSA shit tingles.
This motherfucker's lying.

1099
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,533
Okay, I got you.
I'm gonna record your ass.

1100
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,335
I'm-ma record the
shit outta you.

1101
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,172
You talk too goddamn much.
You're gonna say something.

1102
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,699
Hold on. Record.

1103
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,163
Speaker.

1104
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,375
Unmute.

1105
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,746
Uh, Rose?

1106
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,249
- Uh-huh?
- Um...

1107
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,444
So last time I talked to Chris,
he told me your mama hypnotized him.

1108
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,589
Rod, just stop.

1109
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,332
Huh?

1110
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:07,949
I know why you're calling.

1111
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,674
Why is that?

1112
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:13,326
It's kind of obvious, don't you think?

1113
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,277
What?

1114
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,639
That there's something between us.

1115
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,375
No. What you talking about, girl?
I called you about Chris.

1116
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,778
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out,
I remember you looking at me.

1117
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:26,980
What the fuck you...
No! Chris is my best friend.

1118
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:28,416
Look, if you did something to him...

1119
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,784
I know you think about fucking me, Rod.

1120
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:33,487
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.
Why would you say some stupid shit?

1121
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,257
What the... you ass! Fuck you!
I didn't wanna...

1122
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,612
Fuck you! Bye!

1123
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,828
Shit!

1124
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,631
God! She's so...
She's a fuckin'... She's a...

1125
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,708
She's a genius.

1126
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,623
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1127
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,508
Hey, Chris.

1128
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:28,897
How's it going, buddy?

1129
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,507
You can answer.
There's an intercom in the room.

1130
01:22:35,049 --> 01:22:36,884
Where's Rose?

1131
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,656
Oh, you dirty dog.

1132
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:42,856
You're one of the lucky ones, trust me.

1133
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:46,927
Jeremy's wrangling method
sounds way less pleasant.

1134
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:50,531
I'm supposed to answer
any outstanding questions,

1135
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,966
concerns you may have so far.

1136
01:22:52,967 --> 01:22:57,438
Apparently, our common
understanding of the process

1137
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,563
has a positive impact on the
success rate of the procedure.

1138
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,615
You could give a shit, right?
Okay.

1139
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,884
Let me just tell you what it is.

1140
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,688
Phase one was the hypnotism.

1141
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,624
That's how they sedate you.

1142
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,759
Phase two is this.

1143
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,648
Mental preparation.
It's basically psychological pre-op.

1144
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,367
Pre-op?

1145
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:27,687
For phase three.

1146
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,912
The transplantation.

1147
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,309
Well, partial, actually.

1148
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:39,880
The piece of your brain connected
to your nervous system

1149
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:45,386
needs to stay put, keeping those
intricate connections intact.

1150
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:48,389
So you won't be gone, not completely.

1151
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:52,694
A sliver of you will still be in there,
somewhere, limited consciousness.

1152
01:23:57,065 --> 01:24:03,504
You'll be able to see and hear
what your body is doing,

1153
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,941
but your existence
will be as a passenger.

1154
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,114
An audience.
You'll live in...

1155
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,550
The Sunken Place.

1156
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,831
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

1157
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:26,827
Yeah.
That's what she calls it.

1158
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:30,464
Now, I'll control the motor
functions, so I'll be...

1159
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,506
Me.

1160
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,887
You'll be me.

1161
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:38,071
Good, good.

1162
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:40,537
You got it quick.
Good on you.

1163
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,608
Why us, huh?

1164
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,078
Why black people?

1165
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,821
Who knows?

1166
01:24:53,822 --> 01:25:00,127
People want a change. Some people
wanna be stronger, faster, cooler.

1167
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,696
Black is in fashion.

1168
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:07,134
But please don't lump me in with that.
I could give a shit what color you are.

1169
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:11,649
No. What I want is deeper.

1170
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:17,017
I want your eye, man.

1171
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,659
I want those things you see through.

1172
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:25,557
This is crazy.

1173
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,515
Okay, I'm done.

1174
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,091
No, no, no, no.

1175
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,041
Jeremy?

1176
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:25,560
You fuck!

1177
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:27,290
You fuck.

1178
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,055
Fuck you!

1179
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,925
Come on! Come on!

1180
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:47,134
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

1181
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:50,467
Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

1182
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,561
911. What's
your emergency?

1183
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:24,564
I'm at the Armitage house.
My name is Chris.

1184
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:27,200
I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?

1185
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,004
I'm at the Armitage...

1186
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:45,252
No, no, no.
Don't do it, don't do it.

1187
01:33:45,253 --> 01:33:47,544
Don't do it.
Just fuckin' go.

1188
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,595
Grandma.

1189
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:30,600
You ruined my house!

1190
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,798
Get him, Grandpa.

1191
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:34,808
Damn you!

1192
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:55,736
Let me do it.

1193
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:10,331
Chris, I'm so sorry.

1194
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:13,251
It's me.

1195
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,297
And I love you.

1196
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:18,652
I love you.

1197
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:21,655
I love you.

1198
01:38:10,518 --> 01:38:12,728
Help. Help.

1199
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:16,006
Help. Help me.

1200
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,341
Oh, shit!

1201
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,278
Chris!

1202
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:09,821
I mean, I told you
not to go in that house.

1203
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:16,312
I mean...

1204
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,427
How'd you find me?

1205
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:32,466
I'm T-S-motherfucking-A.

1206
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:35,668
We handle shit.

1207
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:37,475
That's what we do.

1208
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:43,521
Consider this situation
fuckin' handled.

1209
