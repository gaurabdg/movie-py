00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:01,994
Okay, folks,
if you don't see me again,

170
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:04,063
it's 'cause I'm dead.

171
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,600
Tell me about tonight, Buddy.

172
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:14,173
Tonight, Darling, we will have
post-heist revelry at Bacchanalia.

173
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,909
Why, that is
the finest winin' and dinin'

174
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,545
of all the wines
and dines in town.

175
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,048
Ah, that's us.

176
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:24,383
Bye.

177
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,085
Well, sir,
expect the lady and myself

178
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:29,054
to darken your door
once the nose bag is empty.

179
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:31,824
And, Baby, you did good, kid.

180
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,827
Do me a favor.
Next time Doc calls,

181
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,929
don't pick up.

182
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,597
Don't listen to him.

183
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:49,208
Now, I get absolutely no pleasure
in taking candy from Baby,

184
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,945
but we're fast approaching
the day when you...

185
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,281
Will be all paid up.

186
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:00,585
One more job and I'm done?

187
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,955
One more job and
we're straight.

188
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,957
Sound good?

189
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,892
Oh...

190
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:10,830
I was gonna wait until we were
square, but what the hell.

191
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:12,297
These are for you.

192
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,400
Now give me your burner.

193
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,273
I'm gonna need you behind
the wheel again real soon.

194
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,886
You call, I'm there.

195
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,986
Here's what we know.

196
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,530
Two men and a woman
came into the bank branch

197
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,057
clad in black
business clothing,

198
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,625
trench coats,
bandanas and sunglasses.

199
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,562
They pulled guns and ordered
everybody to the floor,

200
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,797
and then cleaned out
the registers.

201
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,534
And hear this, they even swiped
jewelry from some of the customers.

202
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,270
You awake?

203
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,314
They ran out of the bank
to a waiting getaway car.

204
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:56,008
A driver was there to take them away.
It was a red...

205
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,343
You hungry?

206
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,544
Always.

207
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:00,946
You got it.

208
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,264
Spread to the edges!

209
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:25,470
...is a young Caucasian male.

210
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,206
His identity
remains as yet unknown,

211
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,208
and police are
appealing to anyone

212
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,044
who might recognize him
to come forward.

213
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:34,179
The search for
the suspect is ongoing.

214
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:35,847
Police pursued
the getaway vehicle

215
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,018
across downtown Atlanta
and I-85 by helicopter.

216
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:47,759
Where is that cash from?

217
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,494
Work.

218
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,329
One more job.

219
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,865
Then I'm done.

220
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,868
You don't

221
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,203
belong

222
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,772
in that world.

223
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,946
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
I have a banana in my ear.

224
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,112
You heard me.

And still the bull stands,
bloodied but unrelenting.

231
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,439
Gaston is
running out of time.

232
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:37,042
He's had his tries
from horseback.

233
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:39,578
Now he must try to
end this on foot.

Oh, don't worry

Oh, uh...

Am I being monitored

What can I get you

00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:23,708
Um...

271
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,010
Oh, um, you know
that's a kid's menu, right?

272
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,179
Yeah, oh.

273
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,880
I get it. It's early.

274
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:32,016
So you just starting your day
or did you just get off?

275
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,554
Oh, I don't know if I ever get off.
They call, I go, you know?

276
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,458
So, what is it you do?

277
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,361
I'm a driver.

I hope not.

you hit the road just for fun?

Yesterday.

288
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,413
Oh, then I'm jealous.

with a plan I don't have.

Just me,
my music and the road.

292
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,256
I'd like that, too.

00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,480
Don't ask me that.

333
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:17,716
That's a No Nose no-no,
page one.

334
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,050
And right here is JD.

335
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:20,952
He put the "Asian"
in home invasion.

336
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,121
And over there is
the one and the only Bats.

337
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,723
No need for intros, Doc.

338
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,392
Everybody from the jungle
to the trap know Bats.

339
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,730
This your boy, right?

340
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,466
This the one you say listens
to the music all the time?

341
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,968
The driver's supposed
to be the eyes and the ears,

342
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,137
not just the eyes.

343
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,640
Why does he listen to music
all the time, Doc?

344
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,518
- He's got mental problems?
- No, no, no, no.

345
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,244
I'm the one got the mental
problems in the crew.

346
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:47,479
Position taken.

347
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:48,713
He's got tinnitus.

348
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,148
Tinna-what?

349
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,150
He had an accident
when he was a kid.

350
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,723
He's still got a hum in the drum.
Plays music to drown it out.

351
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,623
Yeah, but you feel me.

352
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:03,362
Hat?

353
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:04,495
Huh?

354
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,030
Your tattoo says, "Hat."

355
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:08,633
Yeah. It used to say "Hate."

356
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,303
But to increase my chances of
employment, I got the "E" removed.

357
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:13,805
How's that
working out for you?

358
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,040
Who doesn't like hats?

359
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,376
So, Doc,

360
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,043
how many jobs
you done with the kid?

361
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,712
If you can't take
my word for him,

362
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,214
then get back in
that fucking elevator.

363
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,617
You never heard of
the Spirit of 85?

364
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,953
The joyrider?
Yeah.

365
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:32,223
The ghost that baited
cops doing 130 on 85.

366
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:34,626
Headlights off,
brake lights disconnected.

367
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,095
He drove 'em around in circles
on Spaghetti Junction.

368
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,798
Left 'em in the dust every time.
That was our boy there.

369
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,241
Wasn't that, like, 10 years ago?
Yeah.

370
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,701
Well, like I said,
that was our boy.

371
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,311
He's been boosting cars
since he was old enough

372
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:45,804
to see over the dash.

373
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,648
He stole my Mercedes.
Had a lot of merch in it.

374
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,550
I watched him do it, too.
I didn't stop him, though,

375
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:51,943
'cause I was just blinded
by the balls on that kid.

376
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,845
'Course he didn't know
who I was,

377
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,056
or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it,

378
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,150
but once I tracked him down,
I made sure to tell him who I was,

379
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:01,953
what I was capable of,
and how much he owed me.

380
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,688
And since he's
been paying me back,

381
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,382
he's also shown me
what he's capable of.

382
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,758
Wow.

383
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,369
I just drew a whole
goddamn map in chalk

384
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:09,994
while we've been
standing here squawking.

385
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,931
That's pretty
fucking impressive, right?

386
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:16,067
Shop, let's talk it.
Baby, you with us?

387
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,743
Bank robbers. Whatever.

388
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:01,613
It's got to be ready for
an 8:30 start in the a.m.

389
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:02,747
Questions?

390
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,451
I got a question, Doc.

391
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:09,488
Why would I believe Phones over
here heard a goddamn word you said?

392
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,423
You laid down your whole play.
He ain't even listening.

393
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,093
Baby?

394
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,467
The target is an armored truck

395
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:23,878
at Perimeter Trust in Dunwoody,
10:00 a.m. sharp.

396
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,336
We have
the details of the route

397
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,506
because someone at the depot
has a nasal problem.

398
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,249
The bank itself is right
near the Buford Highway,

399
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,451
so we should be able
to hit the ramp

400
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,619
within 60 seconds
of getting out.

401
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,177
We also have a diversion crew.

402
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:35,191
They're gonna blow up
a bread truck a ways away,

403
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,081
keep the fuzz busy.

404
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:39,217
The dress code is the Michael
Myers Halloween mask,

405
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,153
but don't all buy your masks at the
same time. It looks suspicious.

406
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,055
The switch car is ready,

407
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,399
but you want me to hit the
long-stay parking structure

408
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,891
at Hartsfield-Jackson

409
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,703
to get a heist vehicle
that stays colder longer.

410
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:50,562
Boost a commuter car,
a family car,

411
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,897
something that blends in well
with morning traffic.

412
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,134
Something on the heavy side in case
we need to ram the cops off the road.

413
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:59,170
A Escalade, Yukon,
Avalanche, whatever.

414
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:02,473
It needs to be ready
for an 8:30 start in the a.m.

415
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,476
Questions?

416
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,811
Well, ain't y'all cute.

417
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:08,647
That's my Baby.

418
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,148
Fuck your Baby.

419
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:35,874
What's in there
is ours.

420
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,242
It belongs to us.

421
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:41,012
They took our money,
our hard-earned paper.

422
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:42,947
They snuck in when we
were asleep last night

423
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:45,950
and took the pants off the
chair and emptied our wallets.

424
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,787
They got what's
rightfully ours.

425
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,623
Let's go get it back,

426
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:53,057
what's rightfully ours.

427
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:58,697
What the fuck is this mask?

428
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,864
Austin Powers.

429
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,900
Doc said Michael Myers!

430
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,334
This is Mike Myers!

431
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:04,707
It should be
the Halloween mask.

432
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:05,870
This is a Halloween mask!

433
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:08,139
No, the killer dude
from Halloween.

434
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:09,473
Oh, you mean Jason.

435
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,643

- No! God! Fuck!

436

Wait, wait.

437
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:14,278
I got to start the song over.

438
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:18,449
The fuck?

439
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,584

440
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,620

00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,147
You from here?

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,682
I am.

You're from here.
Uh-huh.

00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:47,090
You're a driver. You like music.
You don't talk much.

No.

I've, uh, spoken more
to you today

665
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:53,764
than I have to
anyone all year.

666
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:55,365
Whoa.

667
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,200
Okay.

668
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,737
Not a motor-mouth. Noted.

669
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,905
Yeah, yeah. I have...

670
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,042
I have this,
uh, hearing thing.

671
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,277
I was in an accident
when I was little.

672
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:08,746
Is that what
happened to your mom?

673
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,448
Yeah. Yeah, and my dad.

674
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:12,916
I miss her.

675
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:15,986
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,655
No, don't be.

677
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:19,828
I live with my foster dad,
but now he's getting old,

678
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,092
so it's more like
I'm looking after him.

679
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:25,262
Yeah. I know how that feels.

680
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:28,331
I had to look after my mom
when she got sick.

681
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:31,234
It might seem tough now,
but once they're gone,

682
00:40:31,368 --> 00:40:33,437
you'll miss having
someone to care for.

683
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:37,575
I don't have much to
keep me here anymore.

684
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,376
You don't?

685
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,315
You know,

686
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:49,820
mmm, we could get together some
other time, some other place?

687
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:53,824
Oh, you mean, uh, somewhere that's
not a diner or a laundromat?

688
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:56,660
Yeah, well, it's not
that this isn't nice but...

689
00:40:56,794 --> 00:41:00,397
Oh, well,
we could go to, uh... Um...

690
00:41:01,064 --> 00:41:02,432
Oh, Bacchanalia.

691
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:04,668
I've never been.
I... I hear it's nice.

692
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:06,937
Oh, it's... It's the
finest winin' and dinin'

693
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,172
of all the wines
and dines in town.

694
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:11,942
That is nice.

695
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,187
Um, but they got me pulling
doubles this week, though.

696
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:16,213
What about next week?
What's your schedule like?

697
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:17,447
I don't know.

698
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:20,150
Oh, I forgot.
They call, you go.

699
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,119
No, I mean, I'm...
I'm not working.

I'm sorry.

No, don't be.

weapons drawn.

717

Who is that?

756
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:32,575
It's my old boss.

Good meal, Baby?

762
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,492
That foie gras terrine
is something, huh?

763
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,261
Yeah.

764
00:44:51,394 --> 00:44:53,163
You don't look
happy to see me. Why?

765
00:44:53,296 --> 00:44:55,833
I said we were straight,
but did you think we were done?

766
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:57,534
That that was it?

767
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,703
Uh, I guess I did.

768
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,339
Well, I could give you the
good news and the bad news,

769
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:04,241
except there is no bad news.

770
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,744
The good news is you're about
to make a lot of money.

771
00:45:06,877 --> 00:45:10,247
And the good news is you're
about to make a lot of money.

772
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,982
I got... I got a job, Doc.

773
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:14,852
Yeah, but why slave away
delivering GoodFellas pizzas

774
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,087
just to afford
a night out here,

775
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,357
when you could make all that
dough with a great fella? Me.

776
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,927
And then take your gal here for fucking
dinner every night of the week?

777
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,663
You paid off your debt.
Now it's time to profit.

778
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:28,465
This is the fun bit, Baby.

779
00:45:28,598 --> 00:45:30,744
By the time this job is over,
you'll be rolling in money,

780
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:35,372
buying Maseratis and feeding
your gal catfish dipped in gold.

781
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:36,706
So, what do you say?
You in?

782
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,709
Am I in?

783
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:41,821
No, don't answer my question
with another question.

784
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:44,247
You give me one of
two replies. Yes or no.

785
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,886
No, Doc.

786
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,522
You know I never do a job with the
exact same crew twice, right?

787
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:54,024
Yes.
And you also know

788
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:56,526
you've been my driver
for every job since we met.

789
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:58,762
Yes.

790
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:04,134
So, I'm of the thinking
that you are my lucky charm

791
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:07,871
and that I'm not doing
this job without you.

792
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:09,415
Now, I don't think I need
to give you the speech

793
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:10,908
about what happens
when you say no,

794
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,852
how I could break your legs
and kill everyone you love,

795
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:14,476
because you already
know that, don't you?

796
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:17,614
Yeah.

797
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,149
So, what's it gonna be,

798
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,284
behind the wheel
or in a wheelchair?

799
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,286
The first one.

800
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:26,995
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

801
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,927
Don't stay out
too late, now.

802
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,294
Oh.

803
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:35,032
And your, uh, waitress
girlfriend, she's cute.

804
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:37,200
Let's keep it that way.

805
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,136
Good night, sir.

806
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:46,709
Well, that was some
pretty fine winin' and dinin'.

807
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:49,980
Must have friends in high
places to get a table there.

808
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:51,882
Oh, I don't know
about that.

809
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:56,319
Is everything okay, Baby?

810
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:01,424
It will be.

811
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:05,362
You want to talk about it?
I make a mean cup of coffee.

812
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:08,832
I mean, I... I don't.
I make terrible coffee.

813
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,801
I want to, but I...

814
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,436
I can't right now.

815
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,939
You know, you...

816
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:18,876
You don't have
to worry about me.

817
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:20,477
You can tell me anything.

818
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,879
I'm not worried about you.

819
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:24,681
I mean, I...

820
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:28,785
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

821
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:34,257
And I just worry that
I'm not good enough for you.

822
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:38,028
Oh, well, don't.

823
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:44,667
I can see you're kind
and you're different.

824
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,972
And I'm here for you
when you're ready.

825
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:02,652
What are you doing tomorrow?

826
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:06,756
Uh, you tell me.

827
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:31,414
Good morning.

828
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:36,053
These places never
get rolled.

829
00:48:36,186 --> 00:48:38,855
People don't realize that there's
gold in them there hills.

830
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,024
And those that do,
don't have the stones

831
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:43,160
to pull off a job so
public in the hub of it.

832
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,104
This place'll be ripe
around this time tomorrow,

833
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:47,164
but I need you to do
something for me today.

834
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,266
I can't be seen in there,
but you can.

835
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,900
So go inside.

836
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,170
Take note of the number
of cameras and positions,

837
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:55,005
the number of registers open,

838
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,540
the number of employees
and the number of customers.

839
00:48:57,674 --> 00:48:59,342
Is there a guard?
Is he armed?

840
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:01,344
Do they have bandit glass?

841
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:03,546
And get in line,
buy some stamps.

842
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,984
Take your buds out,
pull your shades off.

843
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:10,420
Oh, and, uh, take the nephew.
Less suspicious.

844
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:16,269
The United States Postal Service.

845
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:19,562
We're here, working for you,
seven days a week.

846
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:22,332
We do a lot more
than just stamps these days.

847
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,802
You'd be surprised at
what we have to offer.

848
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:28,081
Yeah, Jack,
all looks fine back here. Over.

849
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,056
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

850
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:49,426
10 cameras,
eight registers, two open,

851
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,063
11 customers and
four employees.

852
00:49:53,196 --> 00:49:54,564
Thank you.

853
00:49:57,934 --> 00:49:59,336
Uh...

854
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,903
Uh, stamps.

855
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:04,107
That your boy?

856
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,209
Sure.

857
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:07,510
Yeah, he sure is.

858
00:50:07,644 --> 00:50:08,645
How old is he?

859
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:12,515
Four.
Eight.

860
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:14,951
They grow up so
freaking fast, don't they?

861
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,488
Does he have a name?

862
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,291
You have a name, don't you?

863
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:22,825
Samm.

864
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:25,495
Well, Samm, I got a mint
with your name on it.

865
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:28,165
You have a mint
that says "Samm"?

866
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:29,566
Aw.

867
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,501
Sweet.

868
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:33,070
Are you here tomorrow?

869
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:35,505
Sure am. Working 9:00
to 5:00, just like Dolly.

870
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:39,376
Oh, Dolly Parton. Yeah.

871
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:41,511
I like her.
Mmm, who doesn't?

872
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:43,613
"Everybody wants happiness,
nobody wants pain.

873
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:46,449
"But you can't have a rainbow
without a little rain."

874
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,717
Wise lady.

875
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:51,288
Yeah, she sure is.
Hmm.

876
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:52,421
Bye.

877
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:02,965
Hit me.

878
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,337
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

879
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,440
10 cameras,
eight registers, three open.

880
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:14,177
And, uh, 11 customers.

881
00:51:18,181 --> 00:51:19,749
And, uh, four employees.

882
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:21,084
Anything else?

883
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:23,620
The teller seemed nice.

884
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:25,054
She gave me a mint.

885
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:26,889
Did she?
Yeah.

886
00:51:27,023 --> 00:51:29,426
You probably wouldn't even
need to use a gun with her.

887
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:32,695
Just say "boo," and she'll
give you the big bills first.

888
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:35,532
Chip's off the old block.

889
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:46,109
What floor are you on?

890
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,011
Third.

891
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:51,514
Those stairs must be a
real bitch for Joe, huh?

892
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:55,051
It's my business
to know everything.

893
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:57,187
So, are they a bitch?

894
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,755
There's an elevator.

895
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,759
Ooh, fancy.

896
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:06,528
So, am I gonna
see you tonight?

897
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:09,732
Yes, you will.

898
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:11,610
You're not just saying what you
think I want to hear, right?

899
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:14,137
You consider me a friend,
don't you?

900
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:16,839
You and I are a team.

901
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:19,242
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

902
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,444
Good to know.

903
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:24,581
You'll be out of
this shithole soon.

904
00:52:24,714 --> 00:52:26,749
You're going up in the world!

905
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,161
Bo's Diner,
what'll you have?

906
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:39,829
Is Debora there?

907
00:52:39,962 --> 00:52:41,331
Debbie, phone.

908
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,400
Keep it short.

909
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:46,669
Hello?
It's Baby.

910
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:49,672
Hey. To what do
I owe this honor?

911
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:53,176
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

912
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,245
Am I still seeing you later?

913
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:57,414
I have to drive again.

914
00:52:57,547 --> 00:53:00,983
Oh, okay. Thought
y'all were done with that.

915
00:53:01,117 --> 00:53:05,255
So did I.
It's not what I want.

916
00:53:05,388 --> 00:53:07,290
And what do you want, Baby?

917
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:11,594
I want us to head west on 20,

918
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:14,364
in a car we can't afford,

919
00:53:14,497 --> 00:53:16,399
with a plan we don't have.

920
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:20,002
Keep driving and never stop.

921
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,339
Are you serious?

922
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:23,840
I am, Debora.

923
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:27,244
You in?

924
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:28,678
I'm in, Baby.

925
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:30,680
See you soon.

926
00:53:40,957 --> 00:53:42,525
♪ Holy calamity,
scream insanity

927

There he is.

932
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,035
Hey, Baby.
Hey, Baby.

933
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:54,971
Hear-No-Evil's back, huh?

934
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:57,307
Have you seen this kid move?
Yeah, I've seen him.

935
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,175
Think Doc likes
having him around

936
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:01,086
because he can park in the
disabled spots by the bank.

937
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,179
- Disabled spot?
- Yeah.

938
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:05,524
He got some shit wrong with his ears.
Tinnitus or something.

939
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:08,184
Anyway, he gotta listen
to music 24 hours a day

940
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:09,986
to drown out
the whining in his ears.

941
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,488
Oh, shit!

942
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:13,523
You know who else has
the exact same thing

943
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:16,058
and does that
exact same thing?

944
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,427
Barbra Streisand.

945
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,071
Darling, do I look like
I know a fucking thing

946
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:20,863
about Barbra
fucking Streisand?

947
00:54:20,997 --> 00:54:23,466
Hey! Watch your mouth.
That's my lady you're talking to.

948
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,634
Yeah.

949
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:27,437
Watch your mouth.

950
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,272
I'll watch what
I want to watch.

951
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:36,413
Is that true?

952
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:38,090
Is that why you have music
in your head all the time?

953
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:39,148
Drown out the noise?

954
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:40,283
Yeah.

955
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:41,818
It keeps me moving.

956
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:44,821
It's an escape. I get it.

957
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:47,857
Hey, Buddy, you seen a violin?
I had a violin here.

958
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,559
Shut up.

959
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:53,763
I used to fool around with
cars when I was a kid.

960
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:56,866
Drive around all night like a speed
freak listening to the radio.

961
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,936
I used to have
my special tape

962
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:02,472
that had my killer
track on it. Get me flying.

963
00:55:02,605 --> 00:55:03,873
You got one of those?

964
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:05,241
Sure.

965
00:55:06,376 --> 00:55:07,777
Well, what is it?

966
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,379
Brighton Rock.
What?

967
00:55:09,512 --> 00:55:10,647
Queen?

968
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:13,115
Yeah.

969
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:14,817
It's got that
crazy big guitar solo.

970
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:16,118
Yeah, I know that song.

971
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:17,796
My brother used to
play Sheer Heart Attack

972
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,356
right through the wall.

973
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:20,990
You got it on here?

974
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:23,326
Uh, I got it on this one.

975
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,828
Play it.
Let's hear that killer track.

976
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:37,106
Yeah.

977
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,640
What you ladies
listening to?

978
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:47,617
Queen.
Queen!

979
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,270
Queen? Streisand, now Queen.
What the fuck? What y'all gonna do?

980
00:55:50,387 --> 00:55:52,365
Y'all gonna belt out show
tunes on the way to the job?

981
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:54,256
You don't need
a score for a score.

982
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,192
You just...

983
00:55:56,325 --> 00:56:00,096
Put your fucking foot on the
gas and drive the goddamn car.

984
00:56:00,229 --> 00:56:01,798
That's all
the music you need, folks.

985
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:04,200
Come on, now.

986
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,770
You never been a wheelman?
You never had a lucky song?

987
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:11,474
Well, a cigarette song.
Apres-heist, glass of scotch.

988
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:12,642
Absolutely.

989
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:15,177
But not before a job.

990
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:18,548
I got enough demons right here
playing music all the time.

991
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:20,383
Yeah, well, that I believe.

992
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:22,294
Had a buddy once walk away from a job.
You know why?

993
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:24,687
Because something was playing
on the radio he didn't like.

994
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:27,590
We about to go in, he won't
get out the fucking car. Why?

995
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,524
'Cause Knock, Knock,
Knockin' on Heaven's Door

996
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:33,095
is playing on the FM.
He called it a hex song.

997
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:35,331
That, End of the Road
by Boyz II Men,

998
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:36,833
Hotel California
by the Eagles.

999
00:56:36,966 --> 00:56:38,868
He called 'em all hex songs.

1000
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:41,571
Then come talking about some crazy
shit like we all gonna die.

1001
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:42,939
So what?
You bail on the job?

1002
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:44,407
Fuck no,
I didn't bail on the job.

1003
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,075
I went and got that money.

1004
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,277
And we didn't die, either.

1005
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,413
Now, he bought it
a little later,

1006
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:52,582
but it had nothing
to do with the heist.

1007
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:54,984
Do all your stories end up
with somebody dying?

1008
00:56:56,786 --> 00:56:58,888
I guess you just
got to find out, huh?

1009
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:03,493
I need four pairs of eyes
and three sets of ears.

1010
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,027
Gather round.

1011
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:18,040
The postal service is dying.

1012
00:57:18,174 --> 00:57:20,276
People don't care
about their mail anymore.

1013
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,913
Lucky for us,
their loss is our gain.

1014
00:57:25,214 --> 00:57:26,616
Money orders.

1015
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:29,486
For I happen to know a guy
who has a machine

1016
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,489
that can turn
blank ones into green.

1017
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:35,758
Each box contains
250 slips per box,

1018
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:37,827
each slip worth
up to a grand.

1019
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,396
That's quarter
a mil per box.

1020
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,398
Dot, dot, dot.
You do the math.

1021
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:44,333
Darling goes in the front.

1022
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:47,604
Buddy takes a five-alligator
count and follows her inside.

1023
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:52,775
You put on these privacy glasses
to blind the CCTV camera.

1024
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,544
Another five-alligator count.

1025
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:56,979
Darling gets in line,
Buddy takes her hostage,

1026
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,214
shotgun to her head.

1027
00:57:58,347 --> 00:58:00,416
That gets you guys
in the back office.

1028
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:03,953
We role-play that a lot.

1029
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:05,221
Uh-huh.

1030
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,490
Baby drives Bats
around the loading dock.

1031
00:58:07,624 --> 00:58:11,561
Bats uses this security card supplied
by an insider with a nasal problem

1032
00:58:11,694 --> 00:58:13,730
to get in the staff entrance
and cover the rear.

1033
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:16,298
You guys grab all the boxes
and then sneak out the back

1034
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,100
to Baby and the waiting car.

1035
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:23,139
Did you get all that, Baby?

1036
00:58:23,272 --> 00:58:24,473
Yeah.

1037
00:58:24,607 --> 00:58:26,676
Okay, one more thing.

1038
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:30,547
We need some fresh hardware,
not traceable to us or any previous jobs.

1039
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,883
Now, I've got some contacts who
can get us some clean firepower,

1040
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:35,518
so the pickup is tonight.

1041
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:37,787
But after the pickup,
you come straight back here.

1042
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,857
You all have an early start in the morning,
and there's eyes everywhere.

1043
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,526
So, you're staying
the night here.

1044
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:47,029
Oh, we in bed together now.

1045
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:58,440

I got to take a leak.

1051
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:20,830
Want some gum?
Want some gum, Buddy?

1052
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:22,531
Yeah, I'll take some gum.

1053
00:59:25,768 --> 00:59:28,537
Tell me what we're
gonna do with all that money.

1054
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:31,574
We're gonna go to Vegas.
We'll put it all on red.

1055
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:33,676
We'll get married again.
It'll be real romantic.

1056
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,345
Mmm.

1057
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:39,215
You know what was real,
real romantic?

1058
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:41,784
What was real,
real romantic?

1059
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:43,720
When you stabbed that guy.

1060
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:45,622
Which guy?

1061
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:47,633
The guy that robbed you,
the guy that called you a whore,

1062
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:49,291
or the guy that
looked at you funny?

1063
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:50,593
The last one.

1064
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,229
Yeah. I do remember that.

1065
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:55,798
Bats just looked at me funny.

1066
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:01,003
You want me to kill Bats?

1067
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:03,405
Not before the job, silly.
Hmm?

1068
01:00:05,507 --> 01:00:07,587
You think we should talk
about this in front of Baby?

1069
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:11,013
He won't say a thing.
Will you, Baby? Hmm?

1070
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:16,018
Jesus Christ.

1071
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:17,353
What,
did you steal all this?

1072
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:19,055
You said
you wanted some gum.

1073
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:21,624
Fuck I'm supposed to do, pay for it?
Let's go.

1074
01:00:23,425 --> 01:00:24,460
Let's go.

Looks like
the farmers' market is open.

1079
01:00:35,638 --> 01:00:37,173
Farmers' market?

1080
01:00:37,306 --> 01:00:39,809
Yeah. Doc says
we got to go see The Butcher.

1081
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:18,815
Come on,
you're going in with us.

1082
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,783
We might not be
leaving in this.

1083
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:30,092
And, uh, find
something funky on there.

1084
01:01:30,226 --> 01:01:32,494
Just in case we got
to rip this joint up.

1085
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,365
Take this.

1086
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:38,067
Act like you
know how to use it.

1087
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,668
Why would he need it?

1088
01:01:39,802 --> 01:01:41,637
Got to swagger in
like you got one,

1089
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:43,572
so we don't all look
like a bunch of pussies.

1090
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:45,641
Darling excluded.

1091
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:50,479
What's with the earbuds?
Recording this or something?

1092
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:51,914
It's just his music.

1093
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:53,728
Yeah, he's loony.
He's just like his tunes.

1094
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,852
What's he listening to?

1095
01:01:55,985 --> 01:01:57,586
How the fuck I know?

1096
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,155
Let me check.

1097
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:04,126
Tequila!

1098
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,795
Which reminds me,

1099
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:08,130
why'd the Mexican dude
throw his wife off the cliff?

1100
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,499
Ah! Ruined it.
Didn't I ruin it?

1101
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:12,902
We met before, right?

1102
01:02:13,035 --> 01:02:14,804
I don't know.
You still alive, right?

1103
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:15,937
Uh-huh.

1104
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,639
Then I guess
we ain't never met.

1105
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:20,142
Shut the fuck up!

1106
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:22,578
I've got it.
I've got it.

1107
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:26,215
Voila!

1108
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,485
Welcome to la charcuterie.

1109
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:33,489
Tonight, gentlemen, madame,

1110
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:35,691
we have only
the finest cuts of pork,

1111
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:38,360
direct from
the local smokehouse.

1112
01:02:38,494 --> 01:02:40,462
You're all experienced
butchers yourself.

1113
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,132
I assume you are aware that
the humble pig can be cooked

1114
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:46,568
from nose to tail,
everything but the squeal.

1115
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:48,905
I can offer you nine cuts

1116
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:51,440
at the best prices
in all of Christendom.

1117
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:53,475
So let's dive in
head-first.

1118
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:57,980
From the jowl comes the godsent
Roman bacon that is guanciale.

1119
01:02:58,114 --> 01:03:00,582
From the shoulder
of the hog comes

1120
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:03,452
the Boston butt,
a tough but tasty cut.

1121
01:03:03,585 --> 01:03:04,887
The picnic shoulder
is a favorite

1122
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:08,624
of those who enjoy
the smoking of pigs.

1123
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:11,027
The center-cut loin,
the double-cut pork chops,

1124
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,461
baby back ribs,

1125
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:15,431
and the Serrano ham,
on the back leg, of course.

1126
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:16,933
All delicious.

1127
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:18,767
Delicious.

1128
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:22,038
And, of course, we have a
fine selection of sausages.

1129
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,305
Well, I'm hungry.

1130
01:03:23,439 --> 01:03:24,907
Fantastique.

1131
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,608
And your choice is...

1132
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:29,778
Well, I'm gonna go
with the picnic shoulder,

1133
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:31,613
'cause, um, I just
love smoking pigs.

1134
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:06,182
Done deal.

1135
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:10,152
Dumb son of a bitch.

1136
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:11,587
Whoa! Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1137
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,000
Fuck, Bats!
You got my wife shot!

1138
01:04:13,089 --> 01:04:14,156
I don't like that!

1139
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,292
Relax, Buddy.
You handled it!

1140
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,236
What the fuck, you piece of shit?
You shot the gunsmiths.

1141
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,661
Weren't they
fucking Doc's contacts?

1142
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:21,130
They were Doc's contacts!

1143
01:04:21,263 --> 01:04:22,464
Guess what, they was pigs.

1144
01:04:22,598 --> 01:04:24,100
Look at the box.
It says "APD."

1145
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,968
I clocked that
tall strip of bacon

1146
01:04:26,102 --> 01:04:28,504
with that fake-ass Louis
Vuitton hat right off the bat.

1147
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:30,606
He busted me in '98.

1148
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:33,118
Now, I don't know about you
lovebirds fucking without a condom,

1149
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:34,887
but when somebody getting
ready to barbecue me,

1150
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:36,031

- Get him!

1152
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:38,991
Baby, don't let him get away!
Get him! Get him!

1153
01:04:39,015 --> 01:04:40,749
Do something!
Get him!

1154
01:04:40,883 --> 01:04:41,984

When your folks name you Bats,
you gonna end up crazy.

I don't doubt you're crazy,

Yeah, or Buddy?
No, they're nicknames.

So, what's your
real name, Darling?

1169
01:05:45,347 --> 01:05:47,283
Monica.

1170
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:49,651

01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:55,958
Huh?

1174
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,395
Hey, stop, stop,

1175

01:06:02,364 --> 01:06:03,932
I said stop. I'm hungry.

1180
01:06:12,508 --> 01:06:13,942
You're telling me no?

1181
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,445
I don't want to go in there.

Well, hello, Baby.

I don't want to go in there.
It sucks.

Yeah, but what you do within

1203
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:31,887
So let me get three
Cokes and one Coca.

1204
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,522
Four Cokes?
Yeah.

1205
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:38,227
Look, here's the deal.

1206
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,229
You rob to
support a drug habit.

1207
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:42,198
I do drugs to
support a robbery habit.

1208
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,300
That's clever.
That's my job, see.

1209
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:46,102
It's you two
who's on vacation.

1210
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:48,370
So you doubt
our credentials?

1211
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:49,984
Wall Street, right?
Doc tell you that?

1212
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:51,540
Doc ain't tell me shit.

1213
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:57,246
Just a educated guess
from an uneducated man.

1214
01:07:57,379 --> 01:07:59,724
Well, Bats, I would be fascinated to
hear your thoughts on the matter.

1215
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:01,383
Tell me if I'm way off,
Buddy.

1216
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:04,886
You were a stockbroker.
Maybe a different wife, maybe kids.

1217
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:08,190
You stack your paper,
but you say shit like,

1218
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:10,302
"Work hard, play harder," but
you play a little too hard.

1219
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:14,463
You rack up debt, the type of debt
that'd make a white man blush.

1220
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:16,232
Maybe you get into
a little trouble.

1221
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:18,009
Maybe you get your hand caught
in the corporate cookie jar.

1222
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:19,544
Maybe you leave and
run off to the desert.

1223
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:21,270
Maybe with your
favorite lap dancer in tow.

1224
01:08:21,403 --> 01:08:23,381
Maybe you disappear into a world
consisting of three things,

1225
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:27,008
money, sex, drugs and action.

1226
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:30,679
Oh, shit, that's four.

1227
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:33,449
Am I close?

1228
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:36,185
This how I look at it.

1229
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:38,687
You guys just think
this is a trip.

1230
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,856
Either way,
if you are Wall Street,

1231
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:43,292
you're a bigger fucking crook
than I could ever be.

1232
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:50,432
I'm gonna go right ahead
and speak for the two of us.

1233
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:57,906
You think you know us?
You don't.

1234
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,508
Mmm.

1235
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:01,743
You think you're
the last word in crazy?

1236
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,147
You're not.

1237
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:07,316
And believe me
when I tell you,

1238
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:10,519
you don't want to
see my Buddy mad.

1239
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:14,022
You haven't seen
how relentless he is.

1240
01:09:14,156 --> 01:09:15,857
Because when he sees red,

1241
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:20,061
you will
see nothing but black.

1242
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,179
You hear that, Speedy?
That's some Oscar shit right there.

1243
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:29,338
That was nice.
Did you rehearse that?

1244
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,106
You see this shit, Baby?

1245

and then they hang up.

1287
01:11:56,385 --> 01:12:00,689
I did not hear
the word "bananas" tonight.

1288
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:03,191
So you tell me who died.

1289
01:12:03,325 --> 01:12:04,860
Well, your contacts
was cops, Doc.

1290
01:12:04,993 --> 01:12:07,696
I know. They were my cops.

1291
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:10,332
Yeah, well,
they fired first.

1292
01:12:10,466 --> 01:12:11,909
And I'm not gonna
take a bullet for you

1293
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:13,277
or nobody else
in this motherfucker.

1294
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:15,604
Is that true?
They fired first?

1295
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:18,674
Yeah.

1296
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:30,686
Baby?

1297
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,521
Ask somebody on
the planet Earth.

1298
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:34,856
I will ask
whoever the fuck I want.

1299
01:12:36,558 --> 01:12:38,193
Go home, job's off.

1300
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
No. What the fuck?

1301
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:43,264
We are 24 hours from being descended
upon by this entire city.

1302
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:45,333
Those pigs are in hog heaven.

1303
01:12:45,467 --> 01:12:47,111
The only way they can ID us is
with a Ouija board or some shit.

1304
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:49,938
Well, your name only takes
four letters to spell out.

1305
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,107
Doc, Bats ain't
my real fucking name.

1306
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:55,844
It's over, Leon.

1307
01:12:57,145 --> 01:12:58,814
Get out of town.

1308
01:12:59,648 --> 01:13:01,483
Wow.

1309
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:03,752
Well, I ain't running, Doc.

1310
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:07,423
I say we drive into the storm.
Ride the hurricane.

1311
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:09,090
We could be on
a non-extradition beach,

1312
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:10,759
drinking
non-extradition cocktails,

1313
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:13,995
counting our non-extradition
cash in 23 hours.

1314
01:13:14,129 --> 01:13:15,673
And who do we get
to fence those money orders

1315
01:13:15,697 --> 01:13:17,833
since you shot the fence?

1316
01:13:17,966 --> 01:13:19,868
Buddy got a guy.

1317
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,046
I mean, I'm just taking a wild
guess here, but Buddy got a guy.

1318
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,939
Ain't that right,
Wall Street?

1319
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:27,275
Yeah, I got a guy.

1320
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:29,010
So let's fucking do this.

1321
01:13:29,978 --> 01:13:31,480
I only hear three voices,

1322
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:34,149
and the last time I checked,
there's four in a car.

1323
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:36,151
Baby? Your call.

1324
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:37,553
Time to make
a big-boy decision.

1325
01:13:37,686 --> 01:13:39,488
Do we do this thing or not?

1326
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:41,256
He's outvoted.
We doing it.

1327
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:43,024
Let him speak.

1328
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:46,327
I say we all get some sleep.

1329
01:13:46,462 --> 01:13:48,096
Get ready for
this fucking thing.

1330
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:09,250
Baby? Your call.

1331
01:14:09,384 --> 01:14:10,986
Time to make
a big-boy decision.

1332
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,121
Do we do this thing or not?

Do we do this thing or not?

1334

Do we do this thing or not?

1335

Uh, coffee.

That doesn't sound smart.

You fucking kidding me?
I got enough on my plate,

01:15:37,673 --> 01:15:40,375
worrying about Bats, I got to
worry about you, too, now?

You know what?
Do me a favor.

1347

If you're gonna mail it in

then go on your little caffeine
run and don't come back.

1349
01:15:52,788 --> 01:15:54,455
If you're just in
this for the buzz,

1350
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:58,159
if driving is just some kind
of escape for you, then go.

1351
01:15:58,293 --> 01:16:02,530
What y'all
doing in here? Huh?

1352
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:04,508
Just making sure everything's
ready for tomorrow.

1353
01:16:04,532 --> 01:16:06,501
Oh, yeah.

01:16:11,139 --> 01:16:13,108
Are you?
No.

1356
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:16,578
Good. That's good.

1357
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,049
'Cause we got
to discuss this.

1358
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,619
No, no, it's the same one.

1359
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:27,321
Baby? Your call.

1360
01:16:27,422 --> 01:16:29,290
Time to make

Do we do this thing or not?

1362
01:16:30,959 --> 01:16:33,995
Now, why you
want to go and do that?

1363
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:36,169
It's just me fooling around.
I like to record stuff.

1364
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:39,935
Why you like to record stuff?

1365
01:16:40,068 --> 01:16:42,437
You the police?

1366
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,981
Supposed to squeal on the road,
not to the cops.

1367
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,774
Speak up, Baby.

1368
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:48,009
I... I like to listen
back to conversations.

1369
01:16:48,143 --> 01:16:53,181
I make music out of the words,
songs, mixes. It's just something I do.

1370
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:55,851
That's one
fucking dumbass excuse.

1371
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:58,286
To be fair, even the cops
couldn't come up with an excuse

1372
01:16:58,419 --> 01:16:59,520
that fucking dumbass.

1373
01:16:59,655 --> 01:17:01,356
Now can you play us
one of your mixes?

1374
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:03,692
I can't, they're... They're just...
They're at home.

01:17:06,895 --> 01:17:08,329
Come on.

1377
01:17:08,463 --> 01:17:09,931
I live really far away.

No, you don't.

1379

Wake up, Baby.

1380
01:17:17,605 --> 01:17:18,807
Time to explain.

1381
01:17:26,414 --> 01:17:27,448
Joe.

1382
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:28,893
Where is he?
What did you do to him?

1383
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:29,951
Oh, the cripple?

Oh, don't worry about him.

He's good.
He ain't going nowhere.

It's Debbie. Debora.

Yeah, except I'm D-E-B-O-R-A.

You said you
didn't know that bitch.

Why would you say
you didn't know her?

Have you been
talking to Debora about us?

1405
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:40,355
I don't say nothing.

01:18:40,488 --> 01:18:41,489
What about Wheels?

1407
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:43,458
He can't say nothing.

1408
01:18:43,591 --> 01:18:45,669
Yeah, but he can read motherfucking
lips, though, can't he?

01:18:45,693 --> 01:18:47,628
Take this fool
back to his shithole.

1410
01:18:47,763 --> 01:18:49,630
I'll find another
driver for tomorrow.

1411
01:18:49,765 --> 01:18:51,909
Doc, I'm available. I can take
him where he needs to go,

1412
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:53,134
get him home safe.

1413
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:55,136
No, you're not
getting a new driver.

I've been on every job
since we met.

1415
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,875
I don't squeal to the cops,
I squeal on the road.

1416
01:19:00,008 --> 01:19:01,542
And I'm not slow, I'm fast.

1417
01:19:03,812 --> 01:19:06,147
I'm your driver tomorrow.

1418
01:19:06,281 --> 01:19:07,648
I'm driving.

1419
01:19:10,952 --> 01:19:14,689
Well, you heard the kid.
He's driving.

1420
01:19:18,927 --> 01:19:20,195
I'll tell him.

1421
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:24,742
The Atlanta region is under

expected to show up around...

1425
01:19:29,938 --> 01:19:31,348
In downtown Atlanta today

1426
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:32,908
due to the ongoing
construction work

1427
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,709
at the intersection
of Ted Turner and...

1428
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:36,277
Chance of scattered

1429
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,011
thunderstorms
throughout most of the day.

1430
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:40,816
Low tonight about 40.
Tomorrow mostly sunny, 66.

1431
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:46,321
Remember, what's in there is ours.
Belongs to us.

1432
01:19:47,956 --> 01:19:50,425
They got our money.

1433
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:52,560
They got our mama's jewels.

1434
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,967
So let's go back in there
and take back what's ours.

Vroom, vroom, vroom.

How the fuck I look?

1438
01:21:08,403 --> 01:21:09,637
Mmm-mmm.

1439
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:28,389
Drop it!

1440
01:21:32,894 --> 01:21:34,438
- Okay, Baby, let's go.
- Move!

1441

entered a US Post Office branch
downtown shortly after 1:00 p.m.

Hello.
My name is Joseph.

Uh, I like TV.

1550

How would you describe your
relationship with the defendant?

1792
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:18,912
We were friends.

1793
01:46:19,045 --> 01:46:22,081
And I think we both wanted
to be more than that.

1794
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:24,250
He got himself
into a bad spot.

1795
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,386
I was just
trying to get him out.

1796
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,188
I believe the defendant
is of good character.

1797
01:46:29,322 --> 01:46:31,825
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1798
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:34,027
Was the strangest thing.

1799
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:37,030
He finally drove off,

1800
01:46:37,163 --> 01:46:40,266
and he threw
my purse right at me.

1801
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,870
Then he actually said,
"I'm sorry."

1802
01:46:44,003 --> 01:46:46,072
He looked at
me and he shook his head,

1803
01:46:46,205 --> 01:46:49,375
like he was warning me, somehow
telling me not to go inside.

1804
01:46:49,509 --> 01:46:52,879
He looked concerned,
like he was, uh, trying to save me.

1805
01:46:53,012 --> 01:46:55,615
He made a mistake
when he was younger,

1806
01:46:55,749 --> 01:46:57,917
and it's haunted him
ever since.

1807
01:46:58,051 --> 01:47:01,387
When he tried to get out,
he was pressured even harder.

1808
01:47:01,521 --> 01:47:05,625
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.

1809
01:47:05,759 --> 01:47:09,262
Always had. Always will.

1810

to 25 years in
the federal penitentiary,

You got a letter, kid.

Hey, Baby.

1818
01:47:44,598 --> 01:47:46,232
You know, it's funny.

1819
01:47:46,365 --> 01:47:48,735
Even though I heard it so
many times in the court case,

1820
01:47:48,868 --> 01:47:54,207
I still can't get used to the fact
that your real name is Miles.

1821
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,475
It's a cool name, though.

1822
01:47:57,076 --> 01:48:00,246
I can think of a lot
of great Miles songs.

1823

But we still have to get through
all those Baby songs first.
