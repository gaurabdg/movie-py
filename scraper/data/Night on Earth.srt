Greetings from Martin's Cult Movies

1
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,639
Oh.

2
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,709
Thanks.

3
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:38,465
Hello?

4
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,567
Oh, hi.

5
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,934
How ...Oh, I just got in.

6
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,405
No, I mean I literally
just stepped off the plane.

7
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,533
I'm not even in the terminal yet.

8
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:51,611
What's wrong?

9
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:58,011
Fucking assholes! Where
the fuck have you been?

10
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:01,178
You know, we have missed one plane,
and now we're gonna miss another one!

11
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:05,657
You know, this is my ass on the line,
and if I lose my job because of you crazy...

12
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,125
Hey. That's 30 bucks.

13
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,666
Here you go. Keep the change.

14
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,666
Come on, guys. Let's
...What are you doing?

15
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,702
Hello? Could we please go?

16
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:20,433
<i>All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's...</i>

17
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,977
<i>Come on, you guys. Get it
together. It's this way.</i>

18
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,185
Okay. Okay. I'll call him.

19
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:37,280
No, I promise I'll call him
just as soon as I get my luggage.

20
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,121
Oh, no, I'm really
looking forward to it.

21
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,195
Thank you.

22
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,867
Damn.

23
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:00,138

26
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,257
Yeah, this is Corky, car number
36. Boss told me to call in.

27
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:25,064
Hello. Victoria Snelling
calling for Mr. Pitt.

28
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,408
Yes, I can wait.

29
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,564
Hey, Ray. It's me,
Corky. I'm phoning in.

30
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,105
Yeah, I'm out at the airport.

31
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:03,608
Oh, I don't know. It's the
executive terminal or something.

32
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,735
I don't know. I've
never been here before.

33
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,382
No, man. Everything's cool.

34
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:12,475
But listen. This car
runs like shit, man.

35
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,350
I had to pull the plugs
myself this afternoon.

36
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:21,194
Yeah, I know I'm not, but you better
tell Gonzalez to get his ass in gear...

37
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:24,162
or else I'm gonna have to
be your fucking mechanic.

38
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:34,799
Larry. Larry, Victoria.

39
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,274
Yes. I'm... I'm at the airport.
Excuse all the noise.

40
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:40,005
I'm... I'm at the baggage claim.

41
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,046
Well, I...I, um...

42
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:48,850
I'm hoping that you have some good news
for me about that last actress I sent you.

43
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,083
No, man. Everything's great.

44
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:54,786
In fact, I got a really big tip
from these, like, musician dudes.

45
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,889
Hey, Ray. Have you ever heard
of a band called Utensil?

46
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:03,127
No, listen. I brought
back seven tapes...

47
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:06,729
of... of the most sensational
young actresses in the country.

48
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,934
No, not just New York. Uh, Chicago...

49
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:11,977
Minneapolis, Seattle...

50
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,343
San Francisco.

51
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:17,713
Hey, they're all unknown. Yes.

52
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:21,219
Oh, they're wonderful.
They are just so wonderful.

53
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,156
I...

54
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:27,091
I... I like them all.

55
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:29,788
It... It really has to be your decision.

56
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,831
You know, why don't I bring them by?

57
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:36,198
- I'll just stop by my house for a few minutes and
then I'll come right over. - Yeah, I got you, Ray.

58
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:39,067
We'll sit down, and we'll
look at 'em together, okay?

59
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:42,573
- Okay. I'll get a fare here, then I'll
head back downtown. - Take it easy.

60
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:46,077
- You're just gonna love one of these kids.
- Don't worry about nothin', boss.

61
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,239
Relax, okay? See you in a few.

62
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,817
Hey, Ray. I'm not a kid, okay?

63
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,353
Yeah.

64
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,422
Shit.

65
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,618
Hey, you need a cab, lady?

66
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,655
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Yeah, I'm right here.

67
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,168
- You're a taxi driver?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,932
Okay. I, uh...

69
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,008
Yeah. Why not?

70

00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:45,336
Be careful with that, will you? I'm
a little in love with my luggage.

77
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,407
No problem, lady.

78
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,272
Ah, ah! I'll carry
that with me. Thank you.

79
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,351
Okay.

80
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,622
Thank you.

81
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,558
Let me get...

82
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,560
- I need that leg.
- Sorry.

83
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,653
- Just take it.
- Sorry.

84
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:12,664
- Yeah.
- You in?

85
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,893
Yes. Thank you.

Oh, shit.

88
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,572
- What? What's wrong?
- Oh, fuck.

89
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:32,413
<i>Nothin'. Damn it.</i>

90
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,554
Where to?

91
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,556
Beverly Hills, please.

92
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,321
Uh, 6754.

93
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,058
6549.

94
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,068
Damn!

95
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,069
What's the matter?

96
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:28,107
Oh, I left my phone book back in the
suitcase with all my numbers in it.

97
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,608
- I'm afraid we'll have to
pull over... Is it listed?

98
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:34,977
- Listed? - Yes, it's a... it's
a hotel I've called a million...

99
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,517
Why, thank you. Thank you.

100
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:43,316
No problem. Just pass it
back up when you're done.

101
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,891
Are you okay without it up there?

102
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:47,960
Don't worry about it.

103
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,812
Suite 216, please.

104
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,450
Carol. Victoria.

105
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,247
Yes. I, uh
...I just spoke to him.

106
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,818
Oh, he's going nuts as usual.
Ricocheting off the walls.

107
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:24,055
I don't know what to
do with him anymore.

108
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:28,328
I sent him 10 actresses
who were perf... Well...

109
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,494
six of them were perfect.

110
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:33,266
But he just keeps ...he keeps
wanting them younger and younger.

111
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:37,434
Now he wants someone 18 with
absolutely no experience...

112
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:39,637
but the nerves of a paratrooper.

113
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:43,443
He's not human. I think he's an android.

114
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,450
<i>Yeah.</i>

115
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:48,350
<i>Listen. I'm gonna have to go
over there with those tapes..</i>

116
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:51,686
<i>I brought back from, uh...</i>

117
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,420
Carol, I... I, uh... I'm going...

118
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:57,554
I... I'm supposed to have dinner
with Peter and Shera tonight.

119
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,996
<i>But ...</i>

120
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,763
Will you hold on a second, please? Miss.

121
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,067
<i>Would you please, uh...</i>

122
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:09,734
just turn the music off?

123
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:12,744
<i>Sure, mom.</i>

124
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,246
Thank you.

125
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:17,373
This is my day.

126
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,975
Okay. Where were we?

127
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:23,613
Oh, yes. W-Will you call them and
explain and tell them why I can't?

128
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:25,190
Great.

129
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,817
Listen. Were there any messages for me?

130
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:40,006
Carol...

131
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,772
did Mr. Kincade call?

132
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,613
You're sure?

133
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,683
Okay.

134
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,719
Okay.

135
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,489
Okay then. I will, um...

136
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:59,559
I'll ...I'll talk to you tomorrow.

137
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,786
Great. Bye-bye.

138
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,379
<i>Is Mr. Kincade, like, your boyfriend?</i>

139
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,092
Yes, he is.

140
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,662
At least I think he is.

141
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:41,390
Guys... Can't live with 'em,
can't shoot 'em.

142
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,297
Yeah. You can say that again.

143
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:51,800
Oh, your phone book. Here. Thanks a lot.

144
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,881
Sure.

145
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:29,647
Boy, it sure gets dark fast
in the winter, doesn't it?

146
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:34,185
<i>Driving at night doesn't
seem to bother you.</i>

147
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,187
<i>Why should it?</i>

148
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:39,224
<i>Oh, with me it's a big
problem. I have night blindness.</i>

149
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,193
Is that, like, something
that happens when you get old?

150
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:49,196
No. No. Actually, it isn't. Uh...

151
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:52,794
It has nothing to do with
age. I've had it all my life.

152
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:05,448
Fuckin'-A, man. That's fucked.

153
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:40,786
Oh, thank you.

154
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,859
Thank you.

155
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:56,131
You know, it really isn't any of
my business, but you smoke too much.

156
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,572
Okay, mom.

157
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:04,941
You're really happy driving
this taxi, aren't you?

158
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,013
Fuck yes.

159
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,844
I mean, yeah. It's a cool job.

160
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,954
But, I mean, is that
your whole goal in life?

161
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:19,025
Driving taxicabs?

162
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,184
Is there somethin' wrong with that?

163
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:24,229
No, no, no. I'm sorry. I... I...

164
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:28,132
I really didn't mean
that the way it sounded.

165
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,405
Yeah, well, I'll tell you somethin'.

166
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,813
I don't always want to be a cabdriver.

167
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:50,047
- What do you really want to be?
- A mechanic.

168
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,317
A mechanic?

169
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,791
I practically know all
there is to know about it.

170
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:56,794
Both my brothers are mechanics.

171
00:17:56,896 --> 00:18:00,354
They're older than me, but, you know,
'cause I'm, like, a girl, and I'm, like...

172
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:04,528
still kind of young and all, I gotta
kind of, like, work up to it, you know.

173
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,004
<i>What about
marriage and a family?</i>

174
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,941
<i>Definitely.
Definitely want a family.</i>

175
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:13,672
<i>Boys though. Lots of boys.</i>

176
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,748
<i>No girls?</i>

177
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,647
Girls are nice too, I think.

178
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,278
Yeah. Maybe some girls too.

179
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:25,323
But, you know, like, that stuff
...that's all beside the point.

180
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:28,485
The real problem is to find
a good guy for the father.

181
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,029
Tell me about it.

182
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,795
Well, I'm real particular, you know.

183
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:42,341
And I'm also patient enough.
I mean, at least I hope I am.

184
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:46,674
'Cause, you know... I don't know... maybe
you gotta wait a while, you know...

185
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:51,273
'cause, like, maybe it's not so easy to
find, like, the exact right guy, you know.

186
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,682
Like, the one guy, you know?

187
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,621
No.

188
00:18:56,723 --> 00:19:00,420
- Another mechanic maybe.
- Hell, I don't care what he does.

189
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:03,325
As long as he loves me right.

190
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,829
With his soul.

191
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:08,264
You know, takes me for who I am.

192
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,207
I know what you mean.

193
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,711
Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

194
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,712
Right?

195
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:23,782
Yes. You certainly are.

196
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:14,166
Hello? Oh, hi, Marty.

197
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,101
Yes. I talked to him.

198
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:20,661
<i>Of course I know what he wants.
I've heard it a hundred times.</i>

199
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,503
Oh, Marty. Go ahead. Just tell me again.

200
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:31,416
Try driving school, you fucking nimrod!

201
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:42,661
Marty...

202
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:48,326
I may be having a brilliant
streak right here in the taxi.

203
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:51,835
Yes, I'm really in a taxi.

204
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,031
No, I can't tell you right now.

205
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,041
Um...

206
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:59,168
all I can say is...

207
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,247
I have an idea.

208
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:06,713
No. That's why I don't
tell you things, Marty.

209
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:12,447
I'm sorry I sound calm. I
assure you I'm hysterical.

210
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,118
I'll call you the
minute I know anything.

211
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:18,096
Good-bye, Mar...
Good-bye, Marty.

212
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,900
<i>All right. This is Beverly
Drive coming up. Where to?</i>

213
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:26,995
Uh, just turn right on Beverly Court...

214
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:30,234
then follow the hill up
to Beverly Circle, please.

215
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,311
Got ya.

216
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:45,280
<i>It's up on the left. 971.</i>

217
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:52,815
- Want me to take these in the house
for you? - No. Uh, that's okay.

218
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:56,952
- Just put 'em over there, please.
- No, I got it. It's my job.

219
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:09,274
No...

220
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,847
Okay, that'll be, um, 33 bucks, please.

221
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:24,411
Okay. Uh, no. Keep the
...Keep the change.

222
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:27,254
Listen... Thanks.

223
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,328
Can I ask you something?

224
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,523
Now, this is gonna sound a
little crazy to you, but, uh...

225
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,860
Well, I'm a casting agent.

226
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:38,459
That means that I go
out and I find people.

227
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:41,233
You know, for really big movies.

228
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:45,904
And I've been observing you.

229
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:49,243
And I... I honestly think
you have something special.

230
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:53,978
As a matter of fact, I'm casting a part right
...right now that I think you'd be perfect for.

231
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,316
This is a... a terrific part.

232
00:23:57,356 --> 00:23:59,256
You could be a movie star.

233
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:02,623
- What, like right now?
- Well, yeah.

234
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:06,556
I really wouldn't want
to do that, you know.

235
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,295
I mean, I have a job. I really wouldn't
want to lose this job, you know.

236
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:12,963
I really wouldn't want to fuck
things up right now, you know.

237
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,006
You understand, right?

238
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,007
Well...

239
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,009
let's not be hasty.

240
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:23,072
Um, I'm... I'm... I'm serious
about this, you know.

241
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:27,482
I just want to be sure you
understand what I'm offering you.

242
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:30,420
Yeah, but, you know, I'm a cabdriver.

243
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:32,423
You know, this is what I do.

244
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,993
Like I told you, I'm
gonna be a mechanic.

245
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,625
I don't want to press
you. I really don't. Um...

246
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:45,898
But I just want to make
sure that I understand.

247
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:49,304
Are you saying that you...

248
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,809
you just wouldn't be interested
in being a movie star?

249
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:57,782
- Nah.
- Hey, you could be a mechanic later.

250
00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:00,910
Everyone wants to be a movie star.

251
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:04,455
Look, lady. You know, I
like the movies and all.

252
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:07,958
And ...And I see you're
being serious, you know.

253
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,325
But that's not a real
life for me. You know?

254
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,696
I mean, I'm sure there's tons of girls
who wanna be in the movies and all...

255
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:18,065
and, you know, I...

256
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,968
I'm not saying it right.

257
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:24,907
It's just that I have everything
planned out for me, you know?

258
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:27,639
I mean, everything's going
just right for me now.

259
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:34,679
Well, you can't beat that, can you?

260
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,756
Nope.

261
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:41,850
But, you know,
I mean, I appreciate it.

262
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,162
- Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.

263
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:54,105
- Take it easy.
- Sure, mom.

264
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:37,115
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

265
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:01,696
Taxi! Yeah.

266
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:04,497
Yo, yo, yo, yo, taxi! Shit.

267
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:07,003
Gotta get a taxi, man.

268
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:09,734
Here we go. Taxi!

269
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,834
Taxi! Yo, man. Right here.

270
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:15,140
Right here. Whoo! Right.

271
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:17,181
This is the ticket. Yo, what's up?

272
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:22,816
Brooklyn.

273
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:26,414
Brooklyn, man. Yo!
Yo, man! You suck, man!

274
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:29,460
<i>I got your plate number!
I'm gonna call the T.L.C.I</i>

275
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,962
<i>Come on, man. Somebody pick me up.</i>

276
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,760
Yeah. Come on. Pick me up. What's...

277
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:37,768
<i>There's a million fuckin' cabs out here.</i>

278
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:41,406
Cash, man.

279
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:44,237
Yeah. That's the ticket.
This is gonna get me home.

280
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:47,471
Shit. It's gonna get my ass home, man.

281
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,208
I got cash, man!

282
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:53,649
Taxi. Look. I got the cash right here.

283
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,653
Taxi. Come on, man.

284
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,848
Come on, man! What... What...

285
00:28:57,957 --> 00:29:00,653
<i>Fuck all y'all!</i>

286
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:05,325
No, you ain't gettin' ...You ain't takin'
my cab now. You ain't takin' my cab.

287
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:07,490
That's right. Just keep
walkin'. Yeah. That's right.

288
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:12,798
Shit. They know you desperate. That's
all it is. What am I, invisible, man?

289
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:16,841
I don't give a fuck. Get me a
taxi. Have my name on it too.

290
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,747
You go to Brooklyn?

291
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,216
Hello. How are you?

292
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:36,161
I wanna go to Brooklyn.

293
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:38,992
Uh, come in, sir.

294
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:40,030
All right.

295
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:45,869
- You know how to get to Brooklyn?
- "Brookland"?

296
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:48,701
Uh, better you show me.

297
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:52,875
Yeah. All right. Look.

298
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:56,573
Phew. Go straight down Broadway,
and then I'll explain as we go.

299
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:05,022
Hey, what's up?

300
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:09,853
What? You new at this? You
...You got ...You got it in park.

301
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:13,363
<i>Hey, man. You gotta put it in drive.</i>

302
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:16,025
"D."

303
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,103
"D"! "D" is to drive.

304
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:22,106
- Put the motherfucker in drive!
- Yeah, yeah. "D" is to drive.

305
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,476
So...

306
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,944
Okay.

307
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:36,817
Hey, what's ...What you
doin', man? Hey, what ...Hey!

308
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,894
Hey.

309
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:46,328
- Hey, man. What's wrong with the car? Hey.
- It's automatic.

310
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:48,423
Hey. No, no, man. It ain't automatic.

311
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:52,163
<i>Yo. Yo, man. What's wrong with-
Hey, look. What's ...What's up, man?</i>

312
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:54,705
- It's automatic.
- Pull over, man!

313
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:57,901
Just pull the fuck over! Yeah.
Pull over right here, man.

314
00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:03,415
Shit.

315
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:06,617
What?

316
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:10,621
Hey, man. I don't think this shit's gonna
work out, man. I'm gonna get me another cab.

317
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,953
Oh, no, no. Please. Please.

318
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:17,859
You are ...You are my...
my most best customer.

319
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:20,693
No, man. Look, you ain't takin' me
to Brooklyn. You can't even drive!

320
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,701
But you want taxi.
I am a taxi. I am here. Taxi.

321
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:29,331
I know you are a taxi. But
I'm gonna get me another taxi.

322
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:32,376
But no. No. Uh...

323
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:35,208
It's important. It's
very, very important to me.

324
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:37,282
We go.

325
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:40,585
Man.

326
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,048
Yeah.

327
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,090
All right. All right.

328
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:49,354
<i>I'll go to Brooklyn, all
right? We will go to Brooklyn.</i>

329
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:51,361
But you let me drive.

330
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:55,194
<i>See, I drive and you ride.</i>

331
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,701
I'll pay the fare and all that.

332
00:31:57,803 --> 00:32:00,271
<i>But I drive.</i>

333
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:02,704
No. No. It's...

334
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:06,869
<i>- What do you mean, no?
- It's not allowed. Not allowed.</i>

335
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:10,540
Look. Yeah, it's
allowed. This is New York.

336
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:13,914
New ...Okay.

337
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,987
Good.

338
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:18,522
New York. New York.

339
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:20,592
New York.

340
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:23,355
Big trouble.

341
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,453
Big trouble.

342
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:28,465
In big fucking trouble.

343
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,467
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

344
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:33,094
- Do you understand what I
am... what I am saying? - Yeah.

345
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:35,867
Please drive careful.

346
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:38,876
Uh, drive... drive careful.

347
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:41,242
- Yo, man. I know how to
drive. - No... No accident.

348
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:43,577
- No accident. Get in.
- No accident.

349
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:49,045
But don't tell. Don't tell.

350
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:53,352
- Who am I gonna tell, man? Look...

351
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:56,826
- Look, man. Just relax, all right?
- Job. Go.

352
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:00,729
Just wait a minute, all right? Look at
this. You didn't even turn the meter on.

353
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,393
First thing you gotta do is
turn that fuckin' meter on.

354
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:08,404
See, it turns the light off on
top. That means you're occupied.

355
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:13,001
I am ...Yes, I am oc...
occupied. Occupied. Yes. There.

356
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:15,410
Then you gotta put it in "D." You see?

357
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:18,574
I... I know that.

358
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:21,380
Hey, don't be saying nothing
bad, man. I understand that shit.

359
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:23,682
<i>- Put it in "D." "D" is for drive.
- Ja.</i>

360
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,916
Just ...Just chill out, all right?

361
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,925
Damn, man!

362
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:46,177
It's nice.

363
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:51,874
<i>It's New York. It's cool.</i>

364
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:54,748
<i>Ja. It's cold. It's cool.</i>

365
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:58,755
<i>Nah, nah, nah. You know,
it's hip. It's cool. It's happening.</i>

366
00:33:58,857 --> 00:34:02,918
<i>Ah, I understand.
"It's cool” is good.</i>

367
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,495
<i>Right.</i>

368
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,572
Goes good. Goes good.

369
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,303
Yeah. Yeah. Goes good.

370
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:22,073
In English we say, "It's good to go."

371
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:24,479
- It's good to go.
- Yeah.

372
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,017
It's good to go. That's good.

373
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,713
It's good to go. It's good.

374
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:32,985
- Good to go.
- Yeah. Yeah, man. Just chill, all right?

375
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:37,856
We have the same
...We have the same hat.

376
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:39,863
- What?
- The same hat.

377
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:43,901
- No. No, no. Mine's different.
- Oh, no. It's the same hat.

378
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,698
- Mine's different, man...
This is different here. This...

379
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:49,569
Mine's ...Mine's the newest,
latest. Mine's fresh.

380
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:52,473
No. The ear things here. The same.

381
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:55,809
Ear. This ... No, man.
Look, mine is the... the hype.

382
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:57,814
- What is this? Hype?
- The hype.

383
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:59,907
- What's a hype?
- It's fresh.

384
00:35:00,018 --> 00:35:02,953
- Fresh. Fresh hat.
- It's the jammy. The newest, latest.

385
00:35:03,055 --> 00:35:05,751
Fresh hat. It sounds good.

386
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:08,122
- Fresh hat.
- Right.

387
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,899
<i>So where you from anyway?</i>

388
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:20,563
<i>From, uh, Germany.
Eastern Germany.</i>

389
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:23,334
- Eastern Germany?
- Yeah.

390
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:27,173
From the city of Dresden, which
is close to Czechoslovakia. Uh...

391
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:29,474
Close to what?

392
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:31,879
Czechoslovakia.

393
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,975
Prague.

394
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:36,884
Main town. Prague.

395
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:39,981
Huh. What, you ...you escape from there?

396
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:42,060
No, no. I was free to go.

397
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:45,530
You got a family over there?

398
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,758
I have no family.

399
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,473
So, uh...

400
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,906
what'd you do over there
before you came over here...

401
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,978
'cause I know you sure
didn't drive no cab!

402
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:02,103
I was a circus clown.

403
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:03,806
Get the fuck outta here.

404
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:07,408
No, no, no. I
...Wait. I'll show you.

405
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,487
Here.

406
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:24,158
Oh, shit.

407
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,760
That's some bugged-out shit, man.

408
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,612
What's your name, man?

409
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:41,948
Helmut Grokenberger. Here.
There. You can read it. That's me.

410
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:43,681
Helmet?

411
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,689
Helmut.

412
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:49,552
- That's your name?
- Yeah.

413
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:54,223
That's a fucked-up name to
be naming your kid. Helmet.

414
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:58,703
See, 'cause in English,
a helmet would be, like...

415
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,329
you know, like something you
wear on your head, you know?

416
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,374
You know. A ...A helmet.

417
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:09,169
In English, that'd be
like calling your kid, uh...

418
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:11,215
Oh, shit. Uh...

419
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,341
"Lampshade." Some shit like that.

420
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:15,386
No, but...

421
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:19,355
"Hey, Lampshade! Come here
and clean up your room!"

422
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:23,988
So, what's your name?

423
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,198
Yo Yo.

424
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,868
What?

425
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:33,802
Yo Yo. It's my name.

426
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:36,066

00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:39,109
Yo Yo. Yo Yo.

428
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,236
Yo Yo.

429
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:44,076
Yo Yo. It's, uh

430
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:47,515
No, it ...it ain't got nothing to do
with that. It's my name. Yo Yo.

431
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:49,917
It's a toy for ki ...Yo Yo.

432
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:54,353
- Ain't got nothin' to do with that, man.
- Okay. Okay.

433
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,927
Your name Yo Yo. My name Helmut.

434
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:59,156
Yo Yo, Helmut.

435
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:02,529
- It's good.
- Helmet.

436
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:30,495
What?

437
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,994
What the fuck is she doin' out here?

438
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,099
<i>- Goddamn it!
- What has happened?</i>

439
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:42,605
<i>Damn.</i>

440
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:48,507
<i>There she goes again, man.
Fuckin' up again as usual.</i>

441
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:51,582
<i>What has happened?</i>

442
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,243
<i>Shit.</i>

443
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,345
Just be cool, Helmet.
I'll be right back.

444
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:01,185
<i>Angela! Angela!</i>

445
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:04,490
Where the fuck are you goin', man?
Where you goin'? What are you doin'?

446
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,898
What are you doing,
Yo Yo? Get the fuck off me!

447
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:13,095
- Hey, don't be grabbing my clothes, man!
- Then get the fuck off me, man!

448
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:15,639
Ain't nobody on the street. Where
you goin'? Where you steppin' to?

449
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:18,767
- What are you so concerned about what
the fuck am I doing? - I'm concerned!

450
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:21,107
- Why you so fuckin' stupid?
- Party here. Party there. Always partyin'.

451
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,613
- It's none of your fuckin' business.
- It is my business. I'm family.

452
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:26,115
<i>- You're not my family!
- You're supposed to be home with your husband.</i>

453
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:29,551
- He knows where I'm at!
- I doubt if he knows where you're at.

454
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,747
He's
- Don't be touchin' me no more.

455
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:35,486
- I'm not touchin' you. Angela, listen
to me. All right? - What? What?

456
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:40,428
What's up with you? It's a
family thing, all right? Step off.

457
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,366
- Angela, come on.
- Oh, man.

458
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,902
No, man. I don't...
What are you ... Come on.

459

<i>- Don't be hittin' on me.

<i>Get in the car, Angela.</i>

461
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,476
- Get in the fuckin' car. Come on.

Get the fuck off of me, man!

463
00:39:56,748 --> 00:39:59,876
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

464
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:02,385
Angela, just calm down. Just calm down.

465
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,854
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Get in the car. Angela, get in the car.

466
00:40:05,957 --> 00:40:08,016
Don't make me have to hurt you.

467
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:10,754
Don't be kickin' me. Don't be kickin'.

468
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:12,762
- Shit.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

469
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:15,264
What you doin'?

470
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,392
Let me out of this car!

471
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,629
What the fuck is your problem, man?

472
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:22,832
- What the fuck is your fuckin'
problem, man? - You're my problem!

473
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,671
- No, you're my fuckin' problem.
- Angela, don't be cursin' me out.

474
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:30,009
- Well, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
- Look, Angela. Just shut up!

475
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:32,174
No, you shut up. Don't
be telling me to shut up.

476
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:33,251
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

477
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:36,320
- No, you shut up!
- Shit.

478
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,749
You know what your
fuckin' problem is, Yo Yo?

479
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,556
You don't realize that you're
wearing your ass on your head.

480
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,859
Oh, hey, don't worry, Helmet,
man. It's just a family thing.

481
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:52,163
- You're not my fuckin' family.
- Look, I am your family.

482
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,704
- You ain't shit to me. - I'm
your brother-in-law, all right?

483
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:58,333
- Angela, just calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

484
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:01,241
She's really beautiful. She's beautiful.

485
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:04,872
- Yeah, you think so, huh?
- Yes.

486
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:07,008
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

487
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:13,317
- What's your name?
- Helmet.

488
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:16,690
- His name is Helmet Lampshade or some
shit like that. - Oh, fuck you, all right?

489
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:20,322
- Don't fuck with me.
- No, no. My name is Helmut Grokenberger.

490
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:23,799
Here. You can read it.
Helmut Grokenberger.

491
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:25,836
Great.

492
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:29,065
I'm driving with a fuckin'
idiot and some clown.

493
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:31,199
Oh, yes. I am a clown.

494
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:33,675
Yeah, Angela. It's true.

495
00:41:33,778 --> 00:41:35,678
- Shut up!
- No, it's true. Check it out.

496
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,907
- Shut up.
- Hey. Come on, Helmet. Show her.

497
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:40,814
- Do that horn thing you did, man.
- Ah, yes.

498
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:52,121
Yes.

499
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,790
That shit is so bugged, man!

500
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,061
What the hell are you doing?

501
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,763
- Thank you.
- See, what'd I tell you, Angela?

502
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:49,153
Helmet, man. Forget about her.

503
00:42:50,855 --> 00:42:53,380
Check it out, man. Brooklyn
Bridge. Right over there.

504
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:55,391
Oh, that's...

505
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:59,122
<i>That's ...That's beautiful.</i>

506
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:05,536
All the lights.

507
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:19,984
Oh!

508
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:23,654
Like.

509
00:43:31,396 --> 00:43:33,364
You got it, man.

510
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:39,235
- I'm the driver.
- Yeah.

511
00:43:39,337 --> 00:43:41,305
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

512
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,272
Is somebody gonna tell me what
the fuck is goin' on around here?

513
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:48,278
- What you mean?
- What do I mean?

514
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,110
What the fuck are you driving
this cab for, Yo Yo, huh?

515
00:43:51,216 --> 00:43:53,377
And what's up with the fuckin' hats?

516
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:55,817
What is this, the fuckin'
Rocky and Bullwinkle show?

517
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,253
Yes, yes. We ...We have
the same hats. Both.

518
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:01,450
Look. Just forget about
the hats. All right?

519
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,655
Look. It was Helmet's first day drivin'. He
drive like shit. All right? So I took over.

520
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:08,358
- Oh, you took over.
- Yeah.

521
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:12,197
You know, you're a fuckin' typical
control freak. You know that?

522
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:14,498
- Man! Shit.
- Look. Angela, just shut up, all right?

523
00:44:14,606 --> 00:44:17,200
Don't tell me to shut up. I
already told you about that shit.

524
00:44:17,308 --> 00:44:19,139
- I'm telling you to shut up.
- You shut up!

525
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:20,438
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

526
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:22,740
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, all right?

527
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:24,781
Damn.

528
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:28,478
You're a fuckin' idiot,
Yo Yo. You know that?

529
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,555
Yo, you see the sign? It says,
"Sit back in case of short stops."

530
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:33,590
You never know. I might stop real short.

531
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:37,651
You better be careful, because if I get
hurt, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

532
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,787
- Always got to have the last word, right?
- That's right.

533
00:44:39,898 --> 00:44:40,922
<i>- Right.
- That's right.</i>

534
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:43,057
<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

535
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:45,636
Damn!

536
00:44:45,737 --> 00:44:47,637
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say somethin'. Go ahead.

537
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,936
If you fuckin' stop talkin' to me, then
you won't have to hear my fuckin' mouth.

538
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:55,308
So why don't you shut the fuck up, and then I won't
have to be talkin' all the time, you stupid idiot.

539
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:58,211
- Right.
- Oh, fuck you.

540
00:44:58,316 --> 00:45:00,307
Angela, fuck you too.
You know what you like?

541
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:03,114
You're like a fuckin' Chihuahua,
always gnawing at my fuckin' ankles.

542
00:45:03,221 --> 00:45:06,850
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna take a big fuckin'
bite out of your fuckin' ass then...

543
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:09,483
so you better watch
out for this little dog.

544
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:12,290
- Shit.
- Damn.

545
00:45:12,397 --> 00:45:15,161
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck.

546
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,366
- Nice family. Nice family.
- 'Cause he's an asshole. That's why.

547
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:22,372
- Yeah. Right.
- Huh?

548
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:24,374
Asshole. He's an asshole.

549
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:28,973
Asshole.

550
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:44,960
<i>Check it out, Helmet. This is Brooklyn.</i>

551
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:46,963
What you think, man?

552
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:49,033
Uh, it's great.

553
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:52,760
It's a dump.

554
00:45:52,871 --> 00:45:55,931
Don't be sayin' shit like that,
Angela. It's our neighborhood.

555
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,201
Like I give a shit?

556
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,911
It's "Brookland."

557
00:46:31,476 --> 00:46:34,001
You see, Helmet? This is where we live.

558
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:37,809
- Thanks for nothin', asshole.
- Don't be hittin' on me, Angela.

559
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,544
- Oh, shut up.
- No, you shut up.

560
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:46,287
Good-bye to you, Angela.

561
00:46:47,826 --> 00:46:49,794
Good-bye to you
too, Helmet-head.

562
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,794
Good-bye.

563
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:55,164
<i>- Hey, Yo Yo.
- What?</i>

564
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:57,234
Fuck you!

565
00:47:06,077 --> 00:47:09,046
- Take this.
- Oh, yes.

566
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:16,850
Hey. You should count that shit.
You should always count that shit.

567
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:21,525
<i>Ja.</i>

568
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:30,500
You see?

569
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:32,797
<i>Ja.</i>

570
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:34,872
It's a little less.

571
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:37,635
The meter say 13. I only gave you 12.

572
00:47:37,742 --> 00:47:39,710
Yes.

573
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:46,041
It's New York, Helmet.

574
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,142
<i>Money is ...Ja. Money...</i>

575
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:52,421
is not important for me.

576
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:54,514
I am a clown. I ...I need it.

577
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:58,426
It's not important... for me.

578
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:00,622
Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:11,138
So, you know how to get
back to Manhattan, Helmet?

580
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:13,574
Uh, we...

581
00:48:14,612 --> 00:48:17,342
- No. No.
- Shit.

582
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:24,345
All right. You're gonna make the opposite
of every direction we made to get here.

583
00:48:24,455 --> 00:48:28,255
So if ...if we made a right, then this
time you're gonna make a left.

584
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:30,827
And if we made a left,
you're gonna make a right.

585
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:33,830
- Right?
- Ah, yeah. Two rights.

586
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:36,423
No, no, no, no, no, no.

587
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:38,434
Helmet, look.

588
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:42,097
You go down there,
you make a right, then...

589
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:47,103
When you get to that wide street...
you know, that... that... that big one?

590
00:48:47,211 --> 00:48:50,237
- Yeah.
- You're just gonna stop and ask somebody.

591
00:48:51,382 --> 00:48:53,646
Okay. Okay, Mr. Lampshade.

592
00:48:55,753 --> 00:48:57,687
No, no, no, man. No.

593
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:00,451
No, man. You be Mr. Lampshade.

594
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,685
- I be Mr. Lampshade?
- Yeah!

595
00:49:02,794 --> 00:49:05,763
Okay. I be Mr. Lampshade.

596
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:10,161
Yeah.

597
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:12,236
Later for you, Helmet.

598
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:18,834
"D" is to drive.

599
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,743
Yeah. Yeah. You got it. Yeah.
"D." "D." "D" is to drive!

600
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,749
Learn some English, Helmet!

601
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:30,220
<i>Right.</i>

602
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:36,055
<i>Right! Helmet, go right!</i>

603
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:43,129
There's a nice family.

604
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:55,368
Left... or right?

605
00:50:16,134 --> 00:50:19,729
Uh, two rights. Two...

606
00:50:25,543 --> 00:50:27,443
No.

607
00:50:27,545 --> 00:50:29,445
Huh?

608
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:31,515
Straight.

609
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,718
Here.

610
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,354
<i>Ja, ja, ja.</i>

New York.

- In the bag.
- In the bag.

614
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:37,000
You're quite a guy!

615
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,840
So am I.

616
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:42,943
We sure impressed that ambassador.

617
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:44,105
Ah!

618
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:45,938
He's been taken in.

619
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:49,919
More champagne! That's what we need.

620
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,414
The way we suckered him...

621
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:56,750
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

622
00:52:57,461 --> 00:53:00,487
We told you to drive carefully.
We're important people.

623
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:04,261
Hell yes! Extremely important people.

624
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:06,593
If you only knew what's in this case.

625
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,238
Don't you tell him.

626
00:53:08,706 --> 00:53:11,197
The Cameroon ambassador wants
to see us in the morning.

627
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,205
In one piece.

628
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,336
And you drive like a lizard,
first left, then right.

629
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:17,107
You think you're in your jungle here?

630
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:21,615
We're not from the
same jungle, are we? No.

631
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:23,149
Drive carefully.

632
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:27,585
These little brothers who come to
France, don't they have any respect?

633
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:30,285
Did you even hear him say hello?

634
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:33,122
Little brother, where do you
come from that you're so rude?

635
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:35,126
You from Togo?

636
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:36,733
From Gabon?

637
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:40,603
You can't be from Cameroon. From Dakar?

638
00:53:40,705 --> 00:53:43,503
Wait, I'll have a closer look.

639
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:46,810
If his looks don't kill you.

640
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:48,741
With that face he might.

641
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:00,915
I'll tell you.

642
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:02,515
With a face like that,

643
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,151
he must be a representative
of King Beyanzed.

644
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:07,826
You're killing me.

645
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:09,859
It's true!

646
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,901
That's a Beninese's face!

647
00:54:12,003 --> 00:54:13,971
That's it. Benin.

648
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,604
Little brother,

649
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:18,936
are you from Benin?

650
00:54:21,646 --> 00:54:22,806
The Ivory Coast.

651
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,308
Ivory Coast.

652
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:30,251
<i>He's an 'Ivoirien'.</i>

653
00:54:33,057 --> 00:54:34,684
"Can't see a thing!"

654
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:36,190
That explains it!

655
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,487
<i>He's an "Y voit rien. "</i>

656
00:54:39,597 --> 00:54:42,464
You've run four red lights,

657
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:45,626
you can't see a thing, and you drive
at night without your glasses on.

658
00:54:47,738 --> 00:54:50,366
Don't leave your glasses at
home! Keep your eyes on the road.

659
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:53,175
Look! The road is over there!

660
00:54:53,678 --> 00:54:56,670
<i>Who gives these people
cars? An '‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘Ivoirien’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’'!</i>

661
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:03,080
What do you mean, "that explains it"?

662
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:05,246
Ah?

663
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:10,154
I work from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.,
so don't fuck with me in my own taxi.

664
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,721
And I don't give a shit
about your ambassador, okay?

665
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:16,389
Can't we have some fun?

666
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:19,726
We've had champagne, we're very happy...

667
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,896
No, you don't have fun in
my taxi. I work in this taxi.

668
00:55:23,074 --> 00:55:26,373
It's my place of business,
not your fucking playground!

669
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:28,342
Okay, get out.

670
00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:29,513
What do you mean?

671
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:31,513
Just get out of my taxi.

672
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:34,015
Little brother, I only said...

673
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:35,413
Forget it. Just get out.

674
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:37,911
Out of my taxi!

675
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:40,250
But it's 4:00 in the morning.

676
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:44,888
Little brother, what's wrong with you?

677
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:46,791
Look where you're leaving us!

678
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:52,398
Can you believe this guy?

679
00:55:52,503 --> 00:55:54,528
Does he expect us to find a taxi here?

680
00:55:59,777 --> 00:56:01,768
What a fucked-up day.

681
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,710
<i>Rutain.</i>

682
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:12,652
Big brothers, my ass...

683
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:17,722
Shit, they didn't even pay!

684
00:56:17,828 --> 00:56:19,796
I can't believe this shit.

685
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,307
I'll kick your ass.

686
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:05,103
Here's one that won't give me any shit.

687
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,681
Nice driving, asshole.
You almost flattened me.

688
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:36,165
What are we waiting for?

689
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:38,400
Quai de l'Oise, near
Porte de la Villette.

690
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,040
It's near the canal.

691
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:01,123
At the next intersection

692
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:04,200
just follow Canal St.
Martin up to Stalingrad Place

693
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:06,132
then along Quai de la Seine.

694
00:58:06,637 --> 00:58:10,073
Look, I know my job. Don't
tell me how to do my job.

695
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:21,644
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERRED ROUTE,
INDICATE THIS TO THE DRIVER

696
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:28,688
Doesn't this sign say
to follow my directions?

697
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,323
Did you change something?

698
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,134
What, me? Nothing!

699
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:24,180
<i>Pardon.</i>

700
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:27,409
Don't they teach you how to
drive before unleashing you?

701
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:16,991
What are we doing in this tunnel?

702
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:21,061
Why'd you take the fucking tunnel?
I didn't tell you to go this way!

703
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:27,839
I hate the tunnel.

704
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:42,885
Hold still. I got it.

705
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:50,300
<i>Merci.</i>

706
01:01:27,571 --> 01:01:30,267
Hey, don't blind people
usually wear dark glasses?

707
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:34,174
Do they? I wouldn't know.
I've never seen a blind person.

708
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:45,082
You've always been blind?

709
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:46,581
Yeah.

710
01:01:54,164 --> 01:01:56,359
Must be a real drag being blind, huh?

711
01:01:56,467 --> 01:01:59,061
Listen, jerk-off. I
can do anything you can

712
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:00,898
and a lot of things you'll never do.

713
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:02,697
I'm blind, that's all.

714
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:06,102
You can't drive a car, for example.

715
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:07,868
And you can?

716
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:19,315
I didn't mean to make you mad.

717
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:23,086
I don't know any blind people.
I'm curious, that's all.

718
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,726
I'm just like you. I drink,
I eat, I taste things.

719
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:32,430
I listen to music. I feel music.

720
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,930
I do whatever I want.
I even go to the movies.

721
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,637
The movies?

722
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:43,007
And what do you see at the movies?

723
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:47,343
Sometimes I feel the film.

724
01:02:49,052 --> 01:02:49,984
I can hear it.

725
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:53,482
Oh, forget it. You're a pain in the ass.

726
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:58,824
Yeah, but when you eat,
you can't see the food.

727
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,590
The carrots could be blue, for example.

728
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:06,331
And with music, you
can't see the musicians!

729
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:08,596
You don't even know
the shape of a guitar.

730
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:11,299
Yes I know the shape
of a fucking guitar.

731
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:13,807
I feel things I'm sure you never will.

732
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:32,658
Okay then, if you're so smart,
let me ask you a question.

733
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,465
Here's the question.

734
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:38,825
What color am I?

735
01:03:39,203 --> 01:03:41,137
I don't give a fuck about colors.

736
01:03:42,339 --> 01:03:44,933
But people have
different colors of skin!

737
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:49,536
Look, I don't care if you're
green or... blue like a carrot.

738
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,046
For me the word color
doesn't mean anything.

739
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:53,815
I feel colors.

740
01:03:55,018 --> 01:03:56,815
But you'd never understand that.

741
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:10,522
Okay. You hear my voice, my accent.

742
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,565
Tell me where I'm from.

743
01:04:14,304 --> 01:04:17,068
And if I'm right I win
a color TV, is that it?

744
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,407
I don't know, Africa.

745
01:04:24,448 --> 01:04:25,608
From Cameroon.

746
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:28,379
No, the Ivory Coast.

747
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:32,452
Not bad!

748
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:36,720
You're exactly right! Treichville.

749
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:43,652
Can I ask you something personal?

750
01:05:44,294 --> 01:05:45,761
What now?

751
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:52,999
What's it like in bed?

752
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,303
What in bed?

753
01:05:57,741 --> 01:06:02,178
With a man, if you can't see
anything, when you make love,

754
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:06,345
how do you know who's next to you,

755
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,310
who you're making love with?

756
01:06:15,258 --> 01:06:18,694
Listen, when I make love it's
with every centimeter of my body,

757
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:21,957
every pore of my skin.
Unlike you, I'm sure.

758
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:25,765
Believe me, I know the
man I make love with.

759
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:30,003
Even when he's on the
stairs, I know it's him.

760
01:06:30,874 --> 01:06:32,808
I can smell him from a block away.

761
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:37,473
A block away! He must really stink.

762
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,180
Fuck you.

763
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:42,714
I'm glad I can't see you, 'cause
you must be an ugly bastard.

764
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:45,513
That's right.

765
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,804
<i>Et voilà.</i>

766
01:07:35,906 --> 01:07:37,396
Is this Quai de l’Oise?

767
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:38,872
<i>Ouais.</i>

768
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:40,101
Which side?

769
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:43,606
West of the canal, facing
Porte de la Villette.

770
01:07:43,713 --> 01:07:44,805
<i>OK.</i>

771
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:45,847
How much is it?

772
01:07:49,553 --> 01:07:50,611
Forty francs.

773
01:07:51,354 --> 01:07:53,914
Listen, asshole. I've been
trapped in here longer than that,

774
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:56,288
and I don't need your fuckin' charity.

775
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,827
It must be 48 or 49.

776
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:00,621
Here's 50.

777
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:02,025
Keep the change.

778
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,699
You think I was born yesterday?

779
01:08:25,388 --> 01:08:26,821
Watch out for yourself!.

780
01:08:28,058 --> 01:08:30,151
Watch out yourself.

781
01:09:23,713 --> 01:09:26,113
Don't you look where you're
going? We're not in Africa here!

782
01:09:26,216 --> 01:09:27,615
You're a racist!

783
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:30,513
No, I'm not a racist, but you
drive like a fuckin' black!

784
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:33,552
The road goes this way,
and you were going that way!

785
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:36,255
Are you blind or what?

786
01:09:37,561 --> 01:09:38,858
But it's not my fault!

787
01:12:02,772 --> 01:12:04,672
I can't see a thing.

788
01:12:05,608 --> 01:12:08,202
They could put up a streetlight
once in a while in Rome.

789
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,297
Would you like to meet
and make love?

790
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:33,561
<i>Confirmed. I repeat,
send a car immediately.</i>

791
01:12:33,737 --> 01:12:35,398
Where should we do it?

792
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:37,166
<i>12 Marmoratta Street.</i>

793
01:12:37,273 --> 01:12:38,103
And then?

794
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:39,265
<i>Buffalota Street, number 40.</i>

795
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:40,376
And after?

796
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:42,670
<i>Piazza Quadrata, but there is no number.</i>

797
01:12:42,912 --> 01:12:46,211
Okay, we'll do it in Piazza Quadrata.

798
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:48,613
<i>Correct, confirmed,
but there is no number.</i>

799
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:52,084
How many times will we do it?

800
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:53,880
<i>One thousand and one.</i>

801
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,218
How soon?

802
01:12:55,592 --> 01:12:57,253
<i>Five minutes. Three cars.</i>

803
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,796
Three taxis? You little
slut! We're through.

804
01:13:21,718 --> 01:13:24,243
Hotel Genius. What a name for a hotel!

805
01:13:24,554 --> 01:13:26,988
Good evening. I'd like a room between...

806
01:13:27,891 --> 01:13:30,223
Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein.

807
01:13:30,427 --> 01:13:32,224
Yes, thank you. Who's this?

808
01:13:32,362 --> 01:13:33,590
Dante Alighieri, how's it going?

809
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,164
I'm here having coffee with Shakespeare.

810
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:37,323
Isaac Newton!

811
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,558
Beethoven!

812
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:41,267
Beethoven, I'd like you
to meet Charlie Parker.

813
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:46,775
Say something to him, Charlie.

814
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:57,452
Charlie Parker at the Hotel Genius...

815
01:13:59,456 --> 01:14:01,515
If there's no room at the Hotel Genius

816
01:14:01,724 --> 01:14:03,749
I'll take a room at the Hotel Imbecile.

817
01:14:13,102 --> 01:14:15,502
Rome deserted.

818
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:18,300
Beautiful city.

819
01:14:18,741 --> 01:14:20,732
The Romans have all left Rome.

820
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:22,141
Where did they go?

821
01:14:22,345 --> 01:14:23,869
Everyone's in Bergamo.

822
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,105
What do they do in Bergamo?

823
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,427
I love these one-way streets!

824
01:14:43,032 --> 01:14:45,626
It's like bumper cars.

825
01:14:46,769 --> 01:14:49,897
"In the middle of the
journey of our life,

826
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:52,337
oh, dear friends, to you I convey,

827
01:14:52,442 --> 01:14:55,138
I found myself down a street one way."

828
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:07,648
It's a one-way street!

829
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:11,558
That's right, it's one-way, you jerk!

830
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:22,666
This wall wasn't here yesterday!

831
01:15:22,872 --> 01:15:24,965
Like Saint Pete, I will retreat.

832
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:31,544
And like the saints that
led, I'll move ahead.

833
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:35,083
Another one-way street!

834
01:15:35,218 --> 01:15:38,346
They're always changing
everything. Fuckin' idiots...

835
01:15:45,094 --> 01:15:46,254
I'm dangerous?

836
01:15:46,763 --> 01:15:49,323
I've got a taxi and they've got guns

837
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:51,363
and I'm dangerous!

838
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:58,362
I should turn around
and run them both over.

839
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,907
A bishop alone in Rome
at 4:00 a.m.!

840
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,470
Bad luck! Touch my balls.

841
01:17:15,818 --> 01:17:18,651
Excuse me, Father.
The statue confused me.

842
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:20,848
I couldn't see you. Excuse me.

843
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:24,357
Across town, please. To Tiburtino.

844
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,951
Tiburtino? Not the Vatican?
Aren't you a bishop?

845
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:30,859
No, not the Vatican.
And I'm not a bishop.

846
01:18:01,197 --> 01:18:07,397
Father, I want to tell
you that I'm deeply honored

847
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:09,662
to have a bishop in my taxi.

848
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:12,897
My dear son, I'm not a bishop.

849
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:15,734
Yes, I know, you're not a bishop, but...

850
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:25,182
My son, may I ask you a favor?

851
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:26,581
Anything, Father!

852
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:29,116
Could you remove your sunglasses?

853
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:32,125
It's not safe to drive at
night with dark glasses.

854
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:40,493
<i>Grazie, padre.</i>

855
01:18:40,603 --> 01:18:43,436
I put them on this morning
and forgot I was wearing them.

856
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,299
I see better now. Thank you!

857
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,874
I feel like a blind man who's
miraculously recovered his sight!

858
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,949
<i>Grazie, padre. Grazie tante.</i>

859
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:10,698
<i>Padre.</i>

860
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,563
Everything okay, Father?

861
01:19:12,735 --> 01:19:14,100
Everything's okay.

862
01:19:45,635 --> 01:19:49,401
Excuse me, but it says NO SMOKING.

863
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:53,106
That sign? I keep forgetting
to get rid of it. Sorry, Father.

864
01:19:55,478 --> 01:19:58,743
They put one in every
taxi. It's ridiculous.

865
01:20:29,612 --> 01:20:33,309
Father, I know this will
sound a little strange,

866
01:20:33,516 --> 01:20:35,916
but here we are alone,
at night in a taxi,

867
01:20:36,853 --> 01:20:38,946
and it's a little embarrassing,

868
01:20:39,222 --> 01:20:40,587
but I would like to confess.

869
01:20:41,991 --> 01:20:44,585
But this is not the
appropriate place, my son.

870
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:47,158
I know, I said it myself

871
01:20:47,296 --> 01:20:50,925
we're in a taxi, not church,
but I must confess, Father.

872
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:54,461
Dear son, confession is an
act that must remain anonymous.

873
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:58,506
The church must preserve
this anonymity. Otherwise...

874
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:02,206
But I promise I won't tell anyone!

875
01:21:03,379 --> 01:21:05,904
I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.

876
01:21:06,015 --> 01:21:08,279
I've had this taxi for
15 years here in Rome,

877
01:21:08,384 --> 01:21:09,646
and in 15 years

878
01:21:09,752 --> 01:21:12,380
I swear I've never picked
up the same person twice.

879
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:15,651
And even if I picked
you up again in 10 years

880
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:17,757
I wouldn't recognize
you, dressed as a bishop.

881
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:20,654
And I promise I won't
look you in the face.

882
01:21:20,997 --> 01:21:22,931
After all, I've got to drive.

883
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:27,401
I must confess. Please!

884
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:31,795
You won't have to pay the fare, okay?

885
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:37,304
If you don't hear my confession,
I'm afraid I'll burn in hell.

886
01:21:37,713 --> 01:21:39,908
But this is unacceptable.

887
01:21:41,684 --> 01:21:44,619
Father, I've got so
many sins to confess.

888
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:50,248
First thing, when I was
about 12 or 13 years old,

889
01:21:50,459 --> 01:21:53,326
when boys become big men,

890
01:21:53,596 --> 01:21:55,689
well, each his own physique...

891
01:21:56,866 --> 01:22:01,997
and you begin to feel that
desire for, how can I say it...

892
01:22:02,405 --> 01:22:03,337
for love!

893
01:22:03,706 --> 01:22:04,695
For sex!

894
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:06,838
You feel the need for

895
01:22:07,443 --> 01:22:08,603
release!

896
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:15,840
You understand? To
relieve this desire to...

897
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,979
Anyway, I lived in the country
and there weren't many women,

898
01:22:22,124 --> 01:22:24,092
and though you're still a kid,

899
01:22:25,928 --> 01:22:28,192
inside you feel a man's feeling,

900
01:22:29,098 --> 01:22:33,592
and there was no way
to... release this feeling.

901
01:22:35,738 --> 01:22:40,072
So the idea, not mine, but a
real intelligent friend of mine's,

902
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:42,371
of relieving ourselves with...

903
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:45,412
we made love with... how do I say this?

904
01:22:46,148 --> 01:22:48,048
With pumpkins.

905
01:22:48,985 --> 01:22:52,785
Warm, soft, damp, with
seeds inside, so round...

906
01:22:55,791 --> 01:23:00,125
And we would... Help me
find the words, Father.

907
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:03,291
We relieved ourselves
with these pumpkins.

908
01:23:06,802 --> 01:23:10,260
But then, after a certain age, I quit.

909
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:13,373
I don't know if my friends
quit, but that's their business.

910
01:23:15,177 --> 01:23:18,738
I quit because I felt, Father,
and I'm sure you'll agree,

911
01:23:18,848 --> 01:23:22,875
in growing up to be a
sensitive, even religious man,

912
01:23:22,985 --> 01:23:25,783
that love is something every man needs

913
01:23:26,122 --> 01:23:28,920
not with a vegetable, but with something

914
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:30,157
alive!

915
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:36,326
Something that moves, that's
warm, that looks you in the eyes.

916
01:23:36,866 --> 01:23:38,993
Something with a soul.

917
01:23:39,535 --> 01:23:40,934
Anyway, there was a...

918
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:42,561
a sheep.

919
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:44,502
A beautiful little sheep!

920
01:23:46,675 --> 01:23:50,475
She was nice, kind, sweet, pretty.

921
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:52,908
I called her Lola.

922
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:55,677
Not an ugly old sheep like the others,

923
01:23:56,152 --> 01:23:59,053
but a little sheep.
So delicate, refined!

924
01:23:59,722 --> 01:24:03,021
Soft wool, two big eyes watching me.

925
01:24:03,559 --> 01:24:05,857
At first I didn't even notice.

926
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:10,693
And what a sweet little voice!

927
01:24:14,203 --> 01:24:16,034
And I was enchanted.

928
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:17,170
Not like the other sheep.

929
01:24:20,576 --> 01:24:23,704
Her movements were so refined.

930
01:24:26,882 --> 01:24:28,941
She'd come beside me, and somehow

931
01:24:29,418 --> 01:24:31,113
I was always on top of her.

932
01:24:33,556 --> 01:24:36,320
She was so pretty... even erotic!

933
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:40,385
She would embarrass me because

934
01:24:41,931 --> 01:24:44,729
she would come around
when I was with my friends.

935
01:24:48,571 --> 01:24:51,506
People began to notice
this. It was embarrassing.

936
01:24:52,441 --> 01:24:54,636
In fact, finally my father noticed.

937
01:24:55,444 --> 01:24:56,877
A horrible memory.

938
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:59,080
Do you know what my father did?

939
01:24:59,215 --> 01:25:01,149
He sold her to a

940
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:06,583
a butcher.

941
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,888
He sold my Lola to a butcher!

942
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,127
A butcher named Guido Rusticoni.

943
01:25:14,263 --> 01:25:18,927
A fat, hairy, sweaty
guy. Rude, uneducated.

944
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:22,730
Really ugly, disgusting.
He was horrible.

945
01:25:23,339 --> 01:25:26,035
My Lola to a butcher for 80,000 lire.

946
01:25:26,275 --> 01:25:29,608
I felt so badly that I
haven't eaten meat since.

947
01:25:29,912 --> 01:25:32,938
Even now when they ask me,
"Do you want some lamb?"

948
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:35,412
Me, lamb? No, thanks.

949
01:25:35,851 --> 01:25:38,945
I don't eat vegetables either,
because of the pumpkins.

950
01:25:39,522 --> 01:25:42,150
In fact, I don't eat
much at all anymore.

951
01:25:43,092 --> 01:25:45,652
It was very traumatic for me.

952
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:50,898
What I want to say is, I
understand that these are big sins,

953
01:25:52,134 --> 01:25:54,898
but truly, Father,
they are sins of love.

954
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:08,844
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

955
01:26:23,499 --> 01:26:24,796
<i>Ciao, Gino!</i>

956
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,868
<i>Ciao.</i>

957
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:31,468
Gino, how are you?

958
01:26:32,741 --> 01:26:33,605
<i>Ciao.</i>

959
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:37,042
Nothing's going on,
really. No customers.

960
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:38,510
It's a lousy night.

961
01:26:38,981 --> 01:26:41,074
Nothing here either. A real slow night.

962
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:43,515
We haven't made a cent.

963
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,852
A bishop.

964
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:47,452
A bishop?!

965
01:26:47,556 --> 01:26:49,649
A real one? Oh, let me see!

966
01:26:50,092 --> 01:26:52,856
What a darling little bishop!

967
01:26:59,368 --> 01:27:00,426
He's charming.

968
01:27:03,339 --> 01:27:05,705
Stop by later, okay?

969
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:14,950
<i>Ciao.</i>

970
01:27:16,252 --> 01:27:18,550
Gino always cheers me up.

971
01:27:22,191 --> 01:27:23,988
Pretty girls, eh?

972
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,229
So, my brother Vincenzo
lives here in Rome too.

973
01:27:27,663 --> 01:27:31,030
He's a plumber. Repairs pipes, water.

974
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,225
One night he invited me to dinner,

975
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:36,667
he and my
sister-in-law. Monica.

976
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:39,166
So I went to their house.

977
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:42,176
They have a female dog too. Very cute.

978
01:27:42,578 --> 01:27:46,173
So after dinner, he
got an emergency call.

979
01:27:48,984 --> 01:27:53,080
The pipes exploded in a
condominium. Water everywhere.

980
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:57,584
And like a lightning bolt,
he ran off with his tools,

981
01:27:58,894 --> 01:28:01,260
and I was left alone with Monica.

982
01:28:01,497 --> 01:28:04,762
Now, Monica is beautiful!
You should see her.

983
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,027
Absolutely gorgeous.

984
01:28:09,305 --> 01:28:11,773
She really likes me.

985
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:17,071
She always looks at me with those
strange "sister-in-law eyes."

986
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:19,577
At their wedding I
said, "Congratulations!"

987
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:22,440
But she looked at me strangely.

988
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:25,314
She married my brother,
and we're the same type.

989
01:28:25,421 --> 01:28:27,821
I'm even more handsome than he is.

990
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:30,415
So Monica and I were alone.

991
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:33,387
She started to clean up at the sink.

992
01:28:33,696 --> 01:28:37,325
As she bent over, I was
sitting behind her like this,

993
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,931
and from this position I saw

994
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:42,262
two cheeks!

995
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:47,904
An ass from out of this world!

996
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:49,705
With tiny white panties,

997
01:28:49,812 --> 01:28:52,838
riding up a little so you
could see one whole cheek!

998
01:28:52,981 --> 01:28:54,278
The other was partly covered.

999
01:28:54,383 --> 01:28:58,342
Father, I couldn't control myself!.

1000
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:02,348
She turned and looked back
at me with those eyes...

1001
01:29:04,493 --> 01:29:06,825
and suddenly I was on top of her.

1002
01:29:07,029 --> 01:29:08,963
Father, that beautiful ass!

1003
01:29:10,332 --> 01:29:13,995
Pink, soft, round like a pumpkin!

1004
01:29:14,303 --> 01:29:17,329
Those soft, wool panties
reminded me of the sheep,

1005
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:19,838
the pumpkin, the sheep,
my brother's wife...

1006
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:21,968
I was on fire!

1007
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,011
Then we were on the
floor, under the table!

1008
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:29,248
The beauty of it!

1009
01:29:29,351 --> 01:29:33,617
What pleasure! We enjoyed
ourselves like... imagine, Father...

1010
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:35,724
Heaven on earth!

1011
01:29:36,892 --> 01:29:40,623
I said to myself, "But
this is my brother's wife!"

1012
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:42,287
But I couldn't stop!

1013
01:29:42,398 --> 01:29:45,959
And I said it again, "It's
your brother's wife! Stop!"

1014
01:29:46,068 --> 01:29:47,365
But I couldn't!

1015
01:29:49,571 --> 01:29:51,471
It lasted hours!

1016
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:53,598
And she screamed!

1017
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:56,303
And I screamed!

1018
01:29:56,412 --> 01:29:58,209
It was terrible.

1019
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,745
Just beautiful.

1020
01:30:00,015 --> 01:30:01,073
I turned her over,

1021
01:30:02,518 --> 01:30:06,215
kissed her all over, her
neck, her perfect breasts...

1022
01:30:06,955 --> 01:30:09,185
I stayed there all night.

1023
01:30:10,058 --> 01:30:12,856
I never went back because
she's my brother's wife,

1024
01:30:13,295 --> 01:30:15,229
although he never noticed anything.

1025
01:30:15,431 --> 01:30:17,524
Now she smiles whenever she sees me...

1026
01:30:17,633 --> 01:30:18,930
<i>Ciao. Ciao.</i>

1027
01:30:19,034 --> 01:30:23,095
and I say, "Remember when we
fucked like animals on the floor?"

1028
01:30:23,238 --> 01:30:25,832
It was truly paradise!

1029
01:30:25,941 --> 01:30:28,102
My gorgeous
sister-in-law!

1030
01:30:29,111 --> 01:30:32,638
I don't know if you ever made love
with your sister-in-law, Father,

1031
01:30:32,781 --> 01:30:36,808
but you should try it,
because it's absolute heaven.

1032
01:30:36,952 --> 01:30:39,546
Then you just confess. It's incredible.

1033
01:30:39,955 --> 01:30:44,415
Father, I know these
sins must be confessed,

1034
01:30:44,827 --> 01:30:46,920
but they were just so wonderful.

1035
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:54,301
<i>Bellissima.</i>

1036
01:30:54,403 --> 01:30:56,428
<i>Eh, padre?</i>

1037
01:30:57,539 --> 01:30:59,939
<i>Oh-oh. Padre.</i>

1038
01:31:02,845 --> 01:31:04,779
I haven't upset you, have I?

1039
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,140
I guess he fell asleep.

1040
01:31:07,616 --> 01:31:10,278
<i>Padre.</i>

1041
01:31:10,385 --> 01:31:12,114
Padre.

1042
01:31:16,191 --> 01:31:18,182
<i>Padre!</i>

1043
01:31:18,293 --> 01:31:20,056
Father, don't fool around!

1044
01:31:20,162 --> 01:31:22,130
<i>Padre!</i>

1045
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:29,697
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

1046
01:31:29,805 --> 01:31:31,830
Not feeling well?

1047
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:34,738
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

1048
01:31:34,843 --> 01:31:37,812
You're not... dead, are
you? I don't hear anything!

1049
01:31:38,013 --> 01:31:39,071
Holy shit!

1050
01:31:39,181 --> 01:31:41,649
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1051
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:43,718
<i>Padre. Padre!</i>

1052
01:31:43,819 --> 01:31:45,650
It's me, your taxi driver!

1053
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:47,644
I've killed him!

1054
01:31:53,362 --> 01:31:55,660
My God, what have I done?

1055
01:31:56,365 --> 01:31:57,229
He's dead!

1056
01:31:57,332 --> 01:31:59,300
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1057
01:32:01,236 --> 01:32:03,136
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1058
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:04,796
I've killed a priest.

1059
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,999
Even worse, a bishop!

1060
01:32:09,545 --> 01:32:11,012
They'll give me life!

1061
01:32:11,346 --> 01:32:14,042
How many years do you get
for a bishop? Twenty? Thirty?

1062
01:32:15,183 --> 01:32:17,083
<i>Padre!</i>

1063
01:32:17,185 --> 01:32:18,447
Are you asleep?

1064
01:32:19,221 --> 01:32:20,381
Joking?

1065
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,124
He's dead. I've killed a priest!

1066
01:32:24,459 --> 01:32:25,949
I'll be in all the papers:

1067
01:32:26,061 --> 01:32:27,961
TAXI DRIVER KILLS BISHOP

1068
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:31,788
My brother will find out
everything about me and Monica!

1069
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,367
What a fucking mess!

1070
01:32:34,636 --> 01:32:37,298
<i>Padre! Padre.</i>

1071
01:32:39,241 --> 01:32:41,675
And such a nice little
priest. So delicate!

1072
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:45,004
I shouldn't have told him
about the sheep and Monica!

1073
01:32:46,214 --> 01:32:49,342
I'm sorry, Father. Now
I'll really burn in hell!

1074
01:32:49,451 --> 01:32:51,942
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1075
01:32:52,054 --> 01:32:54,818
Where should I put him?

1076
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:01,918
Only a priest, but he weighs
enough to be a cardinal.

1077
01:39:03,024 --> 01:39:06,460
<i>40 India Street, first call.</i>

1078
01:39:07,395 --> 01:39:10,455
<i>40 India Street, car
needed. Second call.</i>

1079
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:17,328
<i>Car 285 to India Street. Thanks, 285.</i>

1080
01:39:20,909 --> 01:39:25,539
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers waiting. First call.</i>

1081
01:39:26,448 --> 01:39:30,179
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers. Second call.</i>

1082
01:39:31,052 --> 01:39:34,920
<i>Industrial Road 29, three
customers. Third call.</i>

1083
01:39:37,926 --> 01:39:40,394
Car 101 will take Industrial Road.

1084
01:39:43,098 --> 01:39:45,362
<i>Hi, Mika! Okay. Bye, bye.</i>

1085
01:39:46,901 --> 01:39:47,868
Bye, bye.

1086
01:40:59,507 --> 01:41:00,974
You called a taxi?

1087
01:41:02,043 --> 01:41:04,136
No, we called a garbage truck.

1088
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:08,214
But you'll have to do the job.

1089
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:25,029
Is he all right?

1090
01:41:27,035 --> 01:41:29,003
No, he's not all right.

1091
01:41:30,638 --> 01:41:32,299
But don't worry about it.

1092
01:41:36,044 --> 01:41:37,136
Let's go.

1093
01:41:38,046 --> 01:41:38,944
Where?

1094
01:41:40,748 --> 01:41:41,840
Home.

1095
01:41:42,717 --> 01:41:45,413
My house is closest,
so drop me off first.

1096
01:41:46,087 --> 01:41:48,180
We're gonna take Aki home first.

1097
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:51,654
But he lives furthest
away, and he's fucked-up.

1098
01:41:52,093 --> 01:41:54,584
You're the one who's
fucked-up. He's our friend,

1099
01:41:54,796 --> 01:41:57,822
and in that condition, we've got
to make sure he gets home okay.

1100
01:41:58,066 --> 01:41:59,363
Then you'll have to pay.

1101
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:00,625
But I don't have any money!

1102
01:42:00,835 --> 01:42:01,995
Well, I don't either!

1103
01:42:04,105 --> 01:42:07,040
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1104
01:42:08,076 --> 01:42:09,509
What about him?

1105
01:42:12,113 --> 01:42:14,343
His severance pay.

1106
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:17,210
Okay, we've got money.

1107
01:42:17,752 --> 01:42:18,650
Let's go.

1108
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,346
Where?

1109
01:42:21,256 --> 01:42:23,588
We all live on the same block.

1110
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:26,226
Just drive across town.

1111
01:43:03,965 --> 01:43:05,557
What's your name?

1112
01:43:06,201 --> 01:43:07,065
Mika.

1113
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:12,001
When I was a kid I had
a hamster named Mika.

1114
01:43:12,106 --> 01:43:14,074
Mika. Mika.

1115
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:21,444
By the way, what was that
about his severance pay?

1116
01:43:23,318 --> 01:43:25,411
He lost his job today.

1117
01:43:27,755 --> 01:43:28,813
Is he all right?

1118
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:32,652
No, he's not all right.

1119
01:43:33,061 --> 01:43:36,497
Didn't he just tell you
that he lost his job today?

1120
01:43:38,866 --> 01:43:41,096
He's all fucked-up,

1121
01:43:41,402 --> 01:43:45,498
and losing his job is
just a small part of it.

1122
01:43:46,874 --> 01:43:48,034
What do you mean?

1123
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:53,340
Today was the worst fuckin'
day of his entire life,

1124
01:43:54,515 --> 01:43:56,312
that's what I fuckin' mean.

1125
01:43:59,254 --> 01:44:02,314
Or yesterday was, anyway...

1126
01:44:06,728 --> 01:44:07,990
I'm sorry to hear that.

1127
01:44:10,865 --> 01:44:12,594
What would you know about it?

1128
01:44:13,935 --> 01:44:16,426
You have no idea how he feels.

1129
01:44:20,808 --> 01:44:23,936
At the moment, I doubt
he feels much of anything.

1130
01:44:26,214 --> 01:44:30,583
Look, Mr. Taxi Man, don't fuck with us!

1131
01:44:30,885 --> 01:44:33,410
Be careful, you idiot! He's driving!

1132
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:34,588
You're the idiot!

1133
01:44:34,822 --> 01:44:37,882
Stop! Or you morons can walk home!

1134
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:00,245
Can I ask something?

1135
01:45:01,816 --> 01:45:02,612
What?

1136
01:45:04,786 --> 01:45:08,654
Your friend. What happened
to him that was so terrible?

1137
01:45:09,457 --> 01:45:10,754
Besides losing his job, I mean.

1138
01:45:13,628 --> 01:45:15,562
What was so terrible?

1139
01:45:16,931 --> 01:45:19,422
I'll tell you what was so terrible.

1140
01:45:20,702 --> 01:45:24,399
This morning he drives his car to work.

1141
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,800
New car, just paid off.

1142
01:45:28,076 --> 01:45:30,340
He parks and goes to work.

1143
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,340
He's late for work,
but that's nothing new.

1144
01:45:35,883 --> 01:45:38,477
But today, bad news:

1145
01:45:38,786 --> 01:45:40,344
he's fired.

1146
01:45:40,555 --> 01:45:42,648
Late once too often.

1147
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:46,516
So then he has a big
fight with his boss.

1148
01:45:46,661 --> 01:45:49,824
They throw him out into the street

1149
01:45:50,064 --> 01:45:52,157
and his severance pay after him.

1150
01:45:54,869 --> 01:45:58,168
He picks up the envelope,
brushes himself off

1151
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,866
and walks back to his car.

1152
01:46:01,376 --> 01:46:04,903
But instead of his brand-new car

1153
01:46:06,748 --> 01:46:11,617
there's a smashed,
fucked-up ghost of his car.

1154
01:46:11,986 --> 01:46:13,453
Smashed to fuckin' shit.

1155
01:46:14,689 --> 01:46:18,489
Some fuckin' idiot has
turned his brand-new car

1156
01:46:19,026 --> 01:46:20,755
into a useless pile of shit.

1157
01:46:22,163 --> 01:46:26,691
So he has a few drinks to calm
down, then takes a bus home.

1158
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:30,803
At home, waiting for him, are
his wife and 16-year-old daughter.

1159
01:46:31,272 --> 01:46:35,971
They're both crying, and the wife
tells him they have a big problem.

1160
01:46:37,412 --> 01:46:41,542
Then the daughter runs
off to her room, crying.

1161
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:45,310
And the wife tells him that
his daughter, 16 and unmarried,

1162
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,885
is pregnant.

1163
01:46:47,088 --> 01:46:49,682
A beautiful girl too, his daughter.

1164
01:46:49,957 --> 01:46:54,826
You shut up! That's no way to talk
about our best friend's little daughter.

1165
01:46:54,996 --> 01:46:56,327
I didn't mean it like that!

1166
01:46:56,431 --> 01:47:00,458
I know what you meant,
you fuckin' slimy fungus!

1167
01:47:01,903 --> 01:47:03,495
So, is that all?

1168
01:47:05,239 --> 01:47:07,002
No, that's not all.

1169
01:47:08,276 --> 01:47:11,507
He tells his wife that he's lost his job

1170
01:47:11,712 --> 01:47:13,805
and then about their car.

1171
01:47:14,649 --> 01:47:19,348
She becomes hysterical and
screams that she wants a divorce.

1172
01:47:20,688 --> 01:47:24,419
That he's no good as
a father or a husband.

1173
01:47:25,693 --> 01:47:28,253
And then she chases him from the house

1174
01:47:28,963 --> 01:47:30,863
with a big fuckin' butcher's knife.

1175
01:47:31,065 --> 01:47:32,032
A bread knife.

1176
01:47:32,266 --> 01:47:33,426
A butcher's knife!

1177
01:47:33,701 --> 01:47:35,464
He said it was a bread knife!

1178
01:47:35,703 --> 01:47:40,163
<i>- No, he made a point of saying it was
a butcher's knife! - OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.</i>

1179
01:47:40,274 --> 01:47:42,174
<i>OK.</i>

1180
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,885
Things could have been worse.

1181
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,260
What could possibly be worse than that?

1182
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:39,422
Okay, Mr. Taxi Man.

1183
01:48:40,701 --> 01:48:44,501
Whatever happened to you
that was worse than that?

1184
01:48:46,407 --> 01:48:47,601
You want me to tell you?

1185
01:48:48,876 --> 01:48:49,672
Yeah.

1186
01:48:50,711 --> 01:48:53,339
Do you have any children?

1187
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:55,139
I have a son.

1188
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:56,508
I have a daughter.

1189
01:48:58,085 --> 01:49:01,384
I'm glad I have a son
and not a daughter.

1190
01:49:01,556 --> 01:49:03,922
You're an idiot. A
daughter is much better.

1191
01:49:04,425 --> 01:49:07,360
That way you won't have a son
who'll grow up to be like you.

1192
01:49:08,529 --> 01:49:10,759
Even more important then, in your case.

1193
01:49:10,998 --> 01:49:13,432
- In your case, soon nothing
will be important! - Hey!

1194
01:49:13,634 --> 01:49:16,660
Knock it off!. Or you
idiots will have a long walk.

1195
01:49:24,178 --> 01:49:27,375
What about the terrible story
you were about to tell us?

1196
01:49:29,951 --> 01:49:31,213
I'm married.

1197
01:49:31,953 --> 01:49:33,614
That is terrible!

1198
01:49:33,821 --> 01:49:34,810
Big deal.

1199
01:49:34,956 --> 01:49:40,656
My wife and I both work hard. She
has a job, and I have two jobs.

1200
01:49:41,829 --> 01:49:44,457
We've been saving money because
we want to have a family.

1201
01:49:44,799 --> 01:49:46,960
A daughter or a son.

1202
01:49:48,436 --> 01:49:51,132
For a year we've
worked at having a baby.

1203
01:49:51,939 --> 01:49:54,169
Nice work if you can get it.

1204
01:49:54,475 --> 01:49:57,000
Shut up and let him finish.

1205
01:49:57,912 --> 01:50:00,312
Is that your wife?

1206
01:50:00,781 --> 01:50:01,270
Yeah.

1207
01:50:02,683 --> 01:50:03,843
Eija.

1208
01:50:06,187 --> 01:50:09,850
Anyway, after a while
my wife became pregnant.

1209
01:50:10,658 --> 01:50:14,253
We were so happy. My wife's
belly got bigger and bigger.

1210
01:50:15,062 --> 01:50:18,088
Then, in the sixth month,
she started feeling strange

1211
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:20,863
so I took her to the
hospital right away.

1212
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:24,301
Was she all right?

1213
01:50:25,172 --> 01:50:28,141
Well, I took her to the hospital
and they took her inside.

1214
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:32,143
I was worried, waiting
and waiting for hours.

1215
01:50:33,648 --> 01:50:35,548
Finally the doctor came and told me

1216
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:37,775
that Eija had a baby.

1217
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:43,488
She was all right, and the
baby, a little girl, was alive.

1218
01:50:44,558 --> 01:50:46,822
I was so happy I was about to explode.

1219
01:50:47,695 --> 01:50:50,528
- A little daughter.
- Ya.

1220
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:53,997
But the doctor looked worried.

1221
01:50:54,935 --> 01:50:57,233
He told me the baby was way too early.

1222
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:02,136
So far she was okay, but
she was in an incubator.

1223
01:51:03,544 --> 01:51:04,806
And then he said

1224
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:09,076
there was almost no
chance the baby would live.

1225
01:51:16,891 --> 01:51:18,188
So what happened?

1226
01:51:21,195 --> 01:51:24,858
The next day I brought my
wife home from the hospital,

1227
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,394
but the baby stayed
there in the incubator.

1228
01:51:30,237 --> 01:51:31,727
You should have seen her though.

1229
01:51:33,274 --> 01:51:35,037
So tiny and perfect.

1230
01:51:35,776 --> 01:51:37,869
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

1231
01:51:39,747 --> 01:51:42,910
She was shaped like a little peanut.

1232
01:51:49,757 --> 01:51:52,191
But the doctor didn't give us much hope.

1233
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:56,391
He said she wouldn't
live more than a week,

1234
01:51:56,664 --> 01:51:58,256
our tiny daughter.

1235
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,433
Eija was so scared that
she was about to go crazy.

1236
01:52:03,104 --> 01:52:04,571
So I made a big decision.

1237
01:52:05,606 --> 01:52:08,905
I decided that I wouldn't
love this tiny little child.

1238
01:52:10,077 --> 01:52:14,104
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

1239
01:52:14,582 --> 01:52:18,416
I couldn't stand the
pain of losing this child.

1240
01:52:20,287 --> 01:52:23,313
So I decided to kill my love.

1241
01:52:31,999 --> 01:52:35,059
A week went by, and the baby lived.

1242
01:52:39,106 --> 01:52:42,837
Then another week went
by, and part of a third.

1243
01:52:44,311 --> 01:52:47,576
After three entire weeks
the child was still alive.

1244
01:52:48,282 --> 01:52:50,682
But the doctor was still very negative.

1245
01:52:51,352 --> 01:52:53,217
That started to make me angry.

1246
01:52:54,088 --> 01:52:56,454
I sat up all night in the kitchen

1247
01:52:56,991 --> 01:52:59,118
while my poor wife lay
awake in the bedroom.

1248
01:53:01,662 --> 01:53:04,460
And I sat there, just as
the dawn was about to break.

1249
01:53:05,733 --> 01:53:08,463
The light outside was
just like it is right now.

1250
01:53:09,937 --> 01:53:13,498
Then Eija came to me and
said I'd made a mistake.

1251
01:53:14,942 --> 01:53:16,432
I realized she was right.

1252
01:53:17,178 --> 01:53:20,705
If that baby was going to
make it, it needed all my love.

1253
01:53:21,482 --> 01:53:23,245
The strongest love possible.

1254
01:53:24,885 --> 01:53:26,409
It was a relief.

1255
01:53:26,854 --> 01:53:34,090
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

1256
01:53:37,298 --> 01:53:39,892
I felt so happy and clear.

1257
01:53:41,101 --> 01:53:43,661
That little peanut was our child

1258
01:53:45,172 --> 01:53:47,436
and we cried out of happiness.

1259
01:53:48,442 --> 01:53:51,309
We tried to eat some
breakfast, but we couldn't.

1260
01:53:55,115 --> 01:53:56,912
Then we drove to the hospital.

1261
01:53:58,052 --> 01:54:01,818
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

1262
01:54:05,826 --> 01:54:07,123
At the hospital

1263
01:54:07,228 --> 01:54:09,458
the doctor was right there to meet us.

1264
01:54:10,497 --> 01:54:12,431
His face was very serious.

1265
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,063
He took us aside.

1266
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:20,404
And then he told us that
a short time earlier,

1267
01:54:20,507 --> 01:54:22,270
just before sunrise,

1268
01:54:22,443 --> 01:54:24,001
the baby had died.

1269
01:54:24,378 --> 01:54:28,678
Nothing could be done.
It was too late...

1270
01:54:49,703 --> 01:54:51,830
Hey.

1271
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:52,963
Don't worry.

1272
01:54:54,008 --> 01:54:57,341
You and your wife can make another baby.

1273
01:55:00,381 --> 01:55:02,542
Maybe we can, sometime.

1274
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:08,279
Such a sad story.

1275
01:55:13,193 --> 01:55:15,161
You're a good guy, Mika.

1276
01:55:17,831 --> 01:55:19,492
Aki is so full of shit.

1277
01:55:22,369 --> 01:55:25,065
His life isn't so terrible after all.

1278
01:55:25,372 --> 01:55:28,307
He fuckin' whines
about such trivial shit.

1279
01:55:28,409 --> 01:55:32,175
Some people have got real troubles.

1280
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,679
You're right, Mika.

1281
01:55:41,255 --> 01:55:43,189
You're a good man.

1282
01:55:47,127 --> 01:55:49,425
Hey.

1283
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:51,020
We're almost home.

1284
01:55:52,266 --> 01:55:56,327
Take the next right, then
a left. That's our street.

1285
01:55:57,538 --> 01:56:00,632
What about your friend? Is he okay now?

1286
01:56:01,108 --> 01:56:01,904
Fuck him.

1287
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:03,304
Yeah, forget about him.

1288
01:56:03,444 --> 01:56:05,776
What about his wife, and the big knife?

1289
01:56:07,081 --> 01:56:08,708
What knife?

1290
01:56:09,717 --> 01:56:11,844
Oh, that. Fuck it.

1291
01:56:11,952 --> 01:56:17,254
He'll push his way into one of our
houses if he can't get into his own.

1292
01:56:18,392 --> 01:56:20,087
He's a leech anyway.

1293
01:57:27,094 --> 01:57:31,087
Don't worry. Everything
will be all right.

1294
01:57:31,965 --> 01:57:36,061
Yeah. And send greetings
to your wife, Eija.

1295
01:57:36,904 --> 01:57:38,963
Yeah, give her my best too.

1296
01:58:50,277 --> 01:58:52,438
Hey. Aki.

1297
01:58:53,046 --> 01:58:54,445
Wake up, Aki!

1298
01:58:58,819 --> 01:59:00,411
Who the fuck are you?

1299
01:59:02,389 --> 01:59:03,856
Where the fuck am I?

1300
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:07,424
You're in a fucking taxi,
near your fucking home

1301
01:59:07,561 --> 01:59:09,654
and you owe me the fucking fare.

1302
01:59:11,632 --> 01:59:16,569
Yeah, I know. Nothin' for free.

1303
01:59:30,484 --> 01:59:31,382
Thanks.

1304
01:59:46,767 --> 01:59:48,064
You all right?

1305
01:59:52,039 --> 01:59:53,700
You know where you are?

1306
01:59:55,242 --> 01:59:56,209
Yeah.

1307
01:59:57,911 --> 01:59:59,139
Helsinki.

1308
02:01:05,212 --> 02:01:06,440
Morning, Aki.

1309
02:01:07,381 --> 02:01:08,507
Morning.
