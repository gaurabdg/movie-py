This is shit, isn't it?

Yep, solid gold shit, maestro.

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,500
- God, I'm so late.
- It's just round the corner, you'll make it.

45
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,800
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

46
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,200
No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,000
- I love you.
- I know.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

49
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,700
I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,700
Right.

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,900
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes, you did. Get out, loser.

52
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Karen, it's me again.

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm sorry, I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

54
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Absolutely. Horrible moment, though.
Can I call you back?

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Of course.

56
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Understood.

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Er, bugger off, call me later.

59
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,600
So what's this big news?

60
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,300
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

61
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
and I'm the lobster.

62
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,700
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

65
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Duh.

66
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,100
Best sandwiches in Britain.

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
Try my lovely nuts?

68
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

69
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,200
Morning, my future wife.

70
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
(Man) OK, you can stop there. Thanks.

71
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,200
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.

72
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,600
By the way, he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

73
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,100
He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Great, Just Judy!

76
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,400
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,000
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,700
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

79
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,300
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

80
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
That is true.

81
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
Good luck, kiddo.

82
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,400
(Cheering, applause)

83
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
(Press shouting) Prime Minister, over here!

84
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,200
(Cheering)

85
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Thank you.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,200
- Welcome, Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

87
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,400
How are you?

88
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,600
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

89
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,900
Cool. Powerful.

90
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

91
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Yes, I would like that very much indeed.

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,900
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

93
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,100
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning, sir.

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Hated him, I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

96
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

97
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.

98
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot.

99
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,600
No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

100
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,500
And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.

101
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,200
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David. I mean, sir.

102
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Shit, I can't believe I've just said that.

103
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,400
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

104
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,900
You could've said "fuck"
and we'd have been in real trouble.

105
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,800
Thank you, sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Oh, piss it!

107
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
Right, I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
Yeah, I can't see why not.

109
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
- Yes, I did.
- I just went "blurh".

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Ah.

114
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
(Clears throat)

115
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Oh, no.

116
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
That is so inconvenient.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
In the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

118
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,100
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

119
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

120
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

121
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
((Music) Organ plays Wedding March)

122
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,200
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,500
Yeah, I'm mature now.

124
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,600
((Music) Wedding March becomes
La Marseillaise)

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,100
(Chorus) (Music) Love, love, love

126
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,100
(Music) Love, love, love

127
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
- (Music) Love, love, love... (Music)
- Did you do this?

128
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,800
Er, no.

129
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,000
(Music) Love, love, love, love

130
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,100
(Music) There's nothing you can do
that can't be done (Music)

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Oh, it...

132
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,100
(Music) There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

133
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,200
(Music) There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

134
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,700
(Music) It's easy

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,400
(Music) All you need is love

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,300
(Music) All you need is love

137
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,900
(Music) All you need is love, love

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
(Music) Love is all you need... (Music)

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
Look, it's Pikey.

140
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh, I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,800
- The lady of the house let you in, did she?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,200
- Lovely, obliging girl.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,700
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

145
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
- Oh.
- Listen, erm, I've been thinking.

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,500
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

147
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,200
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

148
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
(Girlfriend) Hurry up, big boy!

149
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

150
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,800
(Music and chatter)

151
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!

152
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.

153
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
Taste explosion?

154
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,400
- Food?
- No, thanks.

155
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?

156
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,200
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

157
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh. Tastes like it, too.

158
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm Colin, by the way.

159
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,100
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

160
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

161
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

162
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,500
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

163
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,100
- God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

164
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.

165
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,400
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

166
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
English girls. They're stuck up, you see.

167
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,800
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler, game for a laugh.

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,100
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

169
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

170
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
I think it's crap, Colin.

171
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
That's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,600
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

173
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,800
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

175
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,300
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,300
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting, guys!

177
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,100
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

178
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Judy, could you take the top off this time?

179
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,800
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

180
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes, OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
Not always the case, is it?

182
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years In Tibet...

183
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,100
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

184
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,200
Guys, time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

185
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,500
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

186
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,500
(Judy laughs)

187
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,400
(Director) Right, let's have
another look at that, please.

188
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,800
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

189
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
- OK, yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

190
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,100
I'll warm them up!

191
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
- And massage them, please.
- Right.

192
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,100
It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

193
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,100
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

194
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
Some of her requests,

195
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,400
for instance, that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

196
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,300
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,200
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

199
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,000
I said, "Over my dead body."

200
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100
And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."

201
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
And as usual, my darling girl...

202
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
and Sam's darling mum was right.

203
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,600
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

204
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
inevitably,

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
ever so coolly,

206
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,800
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

207
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,200
(On speakers)
(Music) Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

208

(Music) You're the one girl in town I'd marry

212
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,000
(Music) Girl I'd marry you now if I were free

213
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,200
(Music) I wish it could be

214
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,200
(Music) I could love you but why begin it?

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
(Music) Cos there ain't any future in it

216
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,000
(Music) She's got me but I'm not free so... (Music)

217
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
(From DJ booth)
(Music) Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

(Music) Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

(Music) Wish I never had known you... (Music)

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,100
Do you love him?

223
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Er, er, what?

224
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
No, l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

225
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,800
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

226
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,700
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
(Music)... on my finger... (Music)

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,900
So that's a no, then?

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes. Erm...

230
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
(Music) Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

231
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
(Music) Goodbye baby, baby bye bye... (Music)

232
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,700
This DJ, what do you reckon?

233
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,700
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

234
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
I think it all hangs on the next song.

235
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Now here's one for the lovers.

236
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,300
That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

237
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,700
((Music) S Club Juniors: Puppy Love)

238
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
(Music) And they called it... (Music)

239
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,500
- He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

240
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
(Music) Oh, I guess they'll never know... (Music)

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,300
(Knocks)

242
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,100
Sarah's waiting for you.

243
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
Oh, yes, of course, erm...

244
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
Great, er, good, good.

245
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,900
How are you doing, Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

246
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Absolutely.

247
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,900
- Harry?
- Sarah,

248
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,900
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

249
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,800
Two years, seven months,

250
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,500
three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

251
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,500
And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

252
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Um...

253
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Two years, seven months, three days
and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

254
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,500
Thought as much.

255
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

256
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

257
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, that is... that is bad news.

258
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,400
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

259
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,000
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

260
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,900
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

261
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,400
- You know that?
- Yes.

262
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,900
And so does Karl.

263
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,400
Think about it, for all our sakes.

264
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,000
It's Christmas.

265
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,000
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

266
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
Thanks, boss.

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.

268
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,600
((Music) On radio: Christmas Is All Around)

269
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
(Mobile)

270
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,000
Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

271
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,400
Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?

272
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
What is that?

273
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,900
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.

275
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,400
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

276
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh, and coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

277
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,600
on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

278
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,900
Welcome back, Bill.

279
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.

280
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

281
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,500
Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

282
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,800
Yes, is that an important message
to you, Bill?

283
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
(Snorts) Not really, Mike.

284
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,700
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
- And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

286
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish

287
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

288
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,400
- Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

289
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

290
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

291
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,900
- Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

292
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,700
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

293
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,100
No, only kidding! (Snorts)

294
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,600
- She was rubbish.
- OK, here's one.

295
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,100
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

296
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,700
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

297
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
(Bill laughing)

298
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,000
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

299
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
wasn't some smug teenager

300
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,700
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,400
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

302
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,100
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

303
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,700
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe,

304
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ugliest man in the world,

305
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,400
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

306
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,800
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

307
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
buy my festering turd of a record.

308
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,700
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

309
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,200
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

310
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,700
I think you're referring to

311
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,900
"If you really love Christmas..."

312
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,200
"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.

313
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
So, here it is one more time,

314
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,800
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one,

315
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,200
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.

316
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,900
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?

317
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,000
(Music) I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes (Music)

318
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,700
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

319
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

320
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,200
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

321
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
- like the last government.
- (AIl) Here, here.

322
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,000
This is our first really important test,
let's take a stand.

323
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,700
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

324
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
not to. Not this time.

325
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

326
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

327
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

328
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Right.

329
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,100
(Knocking)

330
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah, come in.

331
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,100
- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

332
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
...and these are for you.

333
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,100
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

334
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,300
I was hoping you'd win, not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

335
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,300
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

336
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Thanks very much. Thanks...

337
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,100
Natalie.

338
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,300
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.

339
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,900
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

340
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh, I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

341
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,700
You know the type, he's married to his job.

342
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,100
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

343
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

344
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,900
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

345
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,900
I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,

346
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

347
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
- Thank you!
- Oh, well, you know.

348
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,500
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

349
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,000
The move again, please, Judy.

350
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
- Ooh, sorry.
- Oh, God, sorry. You all right?

351
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
- Exciting news!
- What?

352
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,100
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

353
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
- No.
- Yes!

354
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,800
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

355
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,400
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

356
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
No, Col! There are a few babes in America,
I grant you,

357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,600
but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

358
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,900
Tone, you're just jealous.

359
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

360
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,300
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

361
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,000
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

362
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,900
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

363
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
- No, Colin, no!
- Yes!

364
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,700
- Nyet!
- Da!

365
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,100
- Nein!
- Ja, darling!

366
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,800
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favourite night of the year

367
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,300
and your unhappy job to organise.

368
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,300
- Tell me.
- It's basic, really.

369
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,100
Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

370
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,200
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

371
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,800
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean, not children.

372
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,400
But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

373
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,200
Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible
six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,000
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

375
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Really?

376
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,300
Right.

377
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,500
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he'll be up there now.

378
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,200
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

379
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,800
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

380
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,800
Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

381
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

382
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I mean, clearly it's about his mum

383
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,600
but Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,600
(Karen) At the age of 11?

385
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,800
(Daniel) Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
Maybe just his veins.

386
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,300
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him, you know, and...

387
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,200
I don't know, this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

388
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,700
like it never did before.

389
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,400
Listen, it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

390
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Just be patient.

391
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,600
And maybe check the room for needles.

392
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,500
And then when he sometimes does
come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

393
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,300
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

394
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,700
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,900
I just don't know.

396
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,600
Get a grip.

397
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,900
People hate sissies.

398
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,200
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

399
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,200
Yeah. Absolutely.

400
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Helpful.

401
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,800
So, what's the problem, Samuel?

402
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,500
Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

403
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,100
Maybe school?

404
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,300
Are you being bullied?

405
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,600
Or is it something worse?

406
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,700
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,400
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,100
Even though you won't be able to help?

409
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,800
Even if that's the case, yeah.

410
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
OK. Well...

411
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,200
truth is, actually...

412
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm in love.

413
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,800
Sorry?

414
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,400
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

415
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,700
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

416
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,900
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,900
Ah, well. OK, well...

418
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,700
- Why?
- Because I...

420
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
thought it'd be something worse.

421
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,900
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

422
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,700
Er...

423
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,400
No, you're right.

424
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,600
Total agony.

425
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,900
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

426
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
(Mobile)

427
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Yeah, absolutely.

428
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,200
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,800
Alone again.

430
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,900
Naturally.

431
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,000
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

432
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,700
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

433
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,300
Thanks.

434
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Natalie.

435
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,400
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

436
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,300
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,900
and me knowing so little about you,
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
Well, there's not much to know.

439
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,500
Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?

440
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,700
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

441
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,100
- Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

442
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,000
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

443
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,600
At the end of the high street,
Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

444
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,900
Erm, and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,200
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

447
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,800
I've just split up with my boyfriend, so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

448
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,200
- Ah. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

449
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm well shot of him.

450
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,600
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,600
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

452
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

453
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
No.

454
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
You know, erm...

455
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,900
being Prime Minister,
I could just have him murdered.

456
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.

457
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,400
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

458
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,500
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

459
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,300
Oh, God.

460
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,400
Did you have this kind of problem?

461
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,400
Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

462
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,800
So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.

463
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,100
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

464
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,500
So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

465
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good, good.

466
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,700
And what does she, he, feel about you?

467
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,700
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,600
And even if she did, she'd despise me.

469
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,100
She's the coolest girl in school.

470
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,200
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

471
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,800
Good. Good.

472
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,300
Well,

473
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
basically you're fucked, aren't you?

474
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,500
((Music) All I Want For Christmas Is You)

475
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,700
Hi there and welcome back.

476
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,000
So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,600
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,100
No. Little scamps.

479
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,600
But very, very talented musicians.

480
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

481
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,500
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.

482
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,600
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

483
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, great.

484
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,100
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,

485
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,900
so if you've got a framed picture,
like, for instance, this one of Blue,

486
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,100
you can just write on it.

487
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,900
(Kids snickering)

488
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,700
(Dec) Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.
(Billy) Oh, yeah.

489
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,700
Hiya, kids.

490
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

491
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,400
don't buy drugs.

492
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

493
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,200
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

494
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,100
(Music) All I want for Christmas is you (Music)

495
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,400
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

496
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
Actually, they're not funny. They're art.

497
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,600
(Laughing)

498
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,400
OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

499
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,800
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line,
she wants to ask you a favour.

500
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,800
- (Sighing) OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.

501
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'

502
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,500
- I'm always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark? '

503
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,500
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

504
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,300
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

505
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,000
- So, what can I do for you?
- 'It's only a tiny favour.'

506
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,000
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

507
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,100
- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I'm sorry.

508
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,900
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

509
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
To be honest, I didn't really...

510
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,800
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

511
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,800
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it,
so don't get any hopes up.

512
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
- 'Must go.'
- (Click)

513
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,200
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

514
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,100
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

515
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
How true.

516
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,800
- (Sarah) Stop.
- (Mobile)

517
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,100
And of course, your mobile goes.

518
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,900
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

519
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,800
- So, how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

520
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,100
Think I've found a venue.

521
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,500
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

522
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,700
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

523
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh. Right.

524
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Good. Well, I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

525
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
You should.

526
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,200
(Typewriter clacking)

527
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
(Bell tinkles)

528
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

529
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,900
Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

530
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
And this year you bring a lady guest?

531
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,400
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

532
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,800
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

533
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,700
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah, yeah.

534
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

535
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,600
This is Aurelia.

536
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
Ah.

537
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,700
- Er, bonjour, Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

538
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,800
(French) Er, je suis, er, très heureux
de vous avoir ici.

539
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,100
Unfortunately, she cannot speak French,
just like you.

540
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,100
She's Portuguese.

541
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,700
(Italian) Ah, ah, buongiorno.

542
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,800
Eusebio, er, er...

543
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,200
(Pidgin Spanish) Er, molto bueno...

544
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,500
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

545
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,000
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

546
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,600
Right.

547
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,400
Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

548
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,200
Can you drive her home after her work?

549
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,100
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

550
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,300
Which is what? Turkish?

551
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,100
(Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

552
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Er, bella.

553
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,400
Er, mon-montagno,

554
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,500
arvarez...

555
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000
No, right. Silence is golden.

556
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,300
As the Tremeloes said.

557
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,900
Clever guys,

558
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,100
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

559
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,300
Gr-great band.

560
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,900
((Music) High-pitched humming:
Silence Is Golden)

561
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,300
Oh, shut up.

562
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,800
(Cheering)

563
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,300
(Press) Mr President!

564
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,800
- Over here, sir!
- What will you be talking about?

565
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,900
Mr President, welcome.

566
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,600
It's a pleasure to meet you.

567
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,500
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

568
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,800
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of Ionely.

569
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

570
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,500
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,200
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

572
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,200
Really? I've never found that.

573
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,700
Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome,
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

574
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,400
- Very jealous of your plane, by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

575
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,800
Ah, Natalie. Hi.

576
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,600
Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?

577
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,300
- (Natalie giggles)
- Excellent.

578
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,800
(Sighs) My goodness,
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

579
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
Did you see those pipes?

580
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

581
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,800
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

582
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,900
That is unexpected.

583
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Well, it shouldn't be.

584
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,700
We're being consistent with their policies.

586
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,600
With all respect, they were bad policies.

587
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,800
Thanks, Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

588
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,700
Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

589
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,700
Well, now, that was an interesting day.

590
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,300
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today,

591
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,200
then just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,200
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

593
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

594
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,600
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,300
I'll give you anything you ask for.

596
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,400
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

597
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,900
Hi.

598
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,000
Pathetic.

599
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,200
It's great Scotch.

600
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,100
I'II, erm... I'll be going, then.

601
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,000
Er, Natalie,

602
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,900
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,600
Thank you, sir.

604
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,800
Er, yes, Peter.

605
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,100
Mr President, has it been a good visit?

606
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,700
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,500
We got what we came for

608
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,000
and our special relationship
is still very special.

609
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,600
Prime Minister?

610
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,100
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

611
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,700
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

612
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,000
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

613
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,100
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to, erm...

614
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,900
Britain.

615
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,100
We may be a small country
but we're a great one, too.

616
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,400
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, the Beatles,

617
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,700
- Sean Connery, Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)

618
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,700
- David Beckham's right foot.
- (Laughter)

619
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,400
David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

620
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,600
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,800
And since bullies only respond to strength,
from now onward,

622
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,700
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

623
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,900
And the President
should be prepared for that.

624
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,900
(Press clamouring)

625
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Mr President!

626
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,300
Joe.

627
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,600
It's your sister on line four.

628
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,500
All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy
and important, how can I help you?

629
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,700
Have you gone completely insane?

630
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,500
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

631
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,400
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

632
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,200
- 'I'll call you back.'
- No, you won't!

633
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,900
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

634
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,100
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

635
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,700
What did I do?
I made a papier-mâché lobster head.

636
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,500
What is this we're listening to?

637
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,800
Joni Mitchell.

638
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,700
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

639
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,300
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

640
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,700
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

641
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Did she? Oh, well, that's good,
I must write to her and say thanks.

642
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,700
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

643
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,900
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

644
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,600
(Female DJ) 'It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic,

645
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,400
'so here's one
for our arse-kicking prime minister.

646
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,100
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'

647
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,700
((Music) Pointer Sisters: Jump)
(Music) Hold me

648
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,500
(Music) I'll give you all that you need

649
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,600
(Music) Wrap your love around me

650
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,300
(Music) You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

651
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,200
(Music) Oh baby

652
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,700
(Music) I'll take you down, I'll take you down

653
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,300
(Music) Where no one's ever gone before

654
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,200
(Music) And if you want more

655
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,900
(Music) If you want more, more, more

656
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,800
(Music) Jump for my love

657
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,800
(Music) Jump in

658
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,600
(Music) And feel my touch

659
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,800
(Music) Jump, if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

660
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,600
(Music) Jump for my love

661
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,100
(Music) I'll take you down, I'll take you down

662
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,800
(Music) Where no one's ever gone (Music)

663
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,800
- (Music stops)
- Yeah, erm,

664
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Mary, can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

665
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,500
- Certainly, sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

666
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,600
Erm. Would you like the last, er?

667
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,000
(Portuguese) Thank you very much but no.

668
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.

669
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
That's all right, more for me.

670
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,700
(Portuguese)
Just don't go eating it all yourself,

671
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,300
you're getting chubbier every day.

672
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,700
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

673
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
(Phone)

674
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,700
- Hello.
- (Ringing continues)

675
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,000
Oop. Sorry.

676
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,200
(Ringing continues)

677
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,100
Hello?

678
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,500
- Thank you.
- (Portuguese) Nao!

679
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,800
- Eu peco imensa desculpa.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

680
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,500
- God, it's half the book. Oh, no.
- Que desastre.

681
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,000
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

682
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,800
They're not worth it!

683
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,800
Stop! Stop.

684
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,500
Aa-ahh.

685
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,900
It's all just rubbish.

686
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,700
Just leave it.

687
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,800
Oh, God, she's in.

688
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,600
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

689
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,200
(Portuguese) Fuck - it's cold!

690
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,000
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

691
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,400
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

692
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,000
It's not worth it,
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

693
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,900
(Portuguese) I don't want to drown

694
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,700
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

695
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,300
Just stop. Stop.

696
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,100
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

697
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,000
I really must do copies.

698
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,600
There'd better not be eels in here.

699
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,700
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.

700
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,900
Oh, what the hell is that?

701
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,200
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

703
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,800
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

704
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,100
Or give me 50% of the profits.

705
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,300
Or I could give you 5% of the profits.

706
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,100
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?

707
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,100
- Romance?
- Yes.

708
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,100
It's, erm...
(Imitates horror film sound effects)

709
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,400
Ah, er...

710
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,700
(Portuguese) Thriller... crime...

711
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,700
(Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime. Crime, murder.

712
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,500
(Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

713
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,600
Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

714
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,100
And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

715
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,900
Mm.

716
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,600
(Portuguese) I'd better get back to work.

717
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,300
- Ah.
- (Portuguese) Later you'll drive me home?

718
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Sure.

719
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,800
It's my favourite time of day...

720
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,900
driving you.

721
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,700
(Portuguese) It's the saddest part
of my day, leaving you.

722
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,300
Sorry.

723
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,000
(TV) 'And coming up
later this morning, it's this guy... '

724
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,500
(Music) There's no beginning, there'll be no end

725
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,300
- (Music) Cos on Christmas...
- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,

726
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,000
'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'

727
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,900
Banoffee pie?

728
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,800
No, thanks.

729
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,200
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

730
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,800
Right, well, lucky you.

731
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,700
- Can I come in?
- Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

732
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,600
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

733
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,700
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

734
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,100
or maybe Munchies?

735
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,400
Actually, I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

736
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,500
Mark, can I say something?

737
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Yeah.

738
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,200
I know you're Peter's best friend

739
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,300
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

740
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,500
Look, don't, don't argue.

741
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,900
We've never got friendly.

742
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,500
But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.

743
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,600
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

744
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,600
It would be great if we could be friends.

745
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,200
Absolutely. Absolutely.

746
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,300
Great.

747
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,300
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

748
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,200
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

749
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,300
This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

750
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,600
Do you think we might be on the right track?

751
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,200
Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.

752
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,100
- Do you mind if I?
- I've probably taped over it.

753
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,200
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

754
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,400
Oh.

755
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,100
Oh, bingo.

756
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,900
That's lovely.

757
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Well done, you.

758
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,700
Oh, that's gorgeous.

759
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,100
Thank you so much, Mark,
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

760
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,500
I look quite pretty.

761
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,900
You've stayed rather close.

762
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,300
They're all of me.

763
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
(Mark) Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,600
Yes.

765
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,800
But...

766
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,100
you never talk to me.

767
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
You always talk to Peter.

768
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,300
You don't like me.

769
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,500
I hope it's useful.

770
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Don't show it around too much.

771
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,000
Needs a bit of editing.

772
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,700
Look, I've got to get to a... lunch.

773
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,700
Early lunch.

774
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,700
You can just show yourself out, can't you?

775
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,700
It's a... self-preservation thing, you see.

776

((Music) Dido: Here With Me)

(Music) Oh I am what I am

778
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,000
(Music) I'll do what I want

779
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,900
(Music) But I can't hide

780
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,200
(Music) And I won't go

781

(Music) Until you're resting here with me

784

- Yeah.

Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat.

794
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,800
Ah...

795
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,400
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.

796
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Anything for the hero of the hour.

797
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,400
Don't ask me why,
and don't read stuff into this,

798
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,900
it's just a weird personality thing.

799
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?

800
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,700
The chubby girl?

801
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
Ooh, would we call her chubby?

802
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,300
I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there,
yes, sir. Huge thighs.

803
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,600
Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...

804
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,600
I'm sure she's a lovely girl
but I wonder if you could, erm...

805
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,200
redistribute her?

806
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,300
It's done.

807
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,500
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

808
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,400
I got some terrible news today.

809
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,400
Let's have it.

810
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,500
- Joanna's going back to America.
- Your girl's American?

811
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,100
Yes, she's American.

812
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,600
And she's not my girl.

813
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,700
And she's going back to America.
That's the end of my life as I know it.

814
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,000
That is bad news.

815
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,500
Well, we need Kate

816
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,900
and we need Leo, and we need them now.

817
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,900
Come on.

818
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,700
'Hold on. Hold on.

819

'Keep your eyes closed.

- 'I trust you.'

821
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,100
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

822
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,700
- Fool!
- Get off, you big bully.

823
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,400
'AII right, open your eyes.'

824
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,100
You know, Sammy,
I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary

825
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,200
but general wisdom is that in the end,

826
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,700
there isn't just one person for each of us.

827
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,900
There was for Kate and Leo.

828
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,600
There was for you.

829
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,600
And there is for me.

830
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,600
She's the one.

831
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,200
Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?

832
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.

833
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,200
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

834
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,100
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

835
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,200
(Pidgin Portuguese)
Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia.

836
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Grande, er... grande familio,
grande tradizione de Christmas presents.

837
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,600
Stupido.

838
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,300
Well, goodbye.

839
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
(Portuguese) Thank you.

840
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,100
Erm, it was, erm...

841
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,200
(Portuguese) I will miss you.

842
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,400
And your very slow typing...

843
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,400
and your very bad driving.

844
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,800

845

Daniel!

850
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,700
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord. Tell me.

851
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
- Well, girls love musicians, don't they?
- Uh-huh.

852
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,000
- Even the weird ones get girlfriends.
- That's right.

853
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,500
Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.

854

For God's sake,
Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.

855
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,400
Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

856
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,300
I thought if I was in the band
and played superbly,

857
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,400
she might fall in love with me.
What do you think?

858
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,500
I think it's brilliant, I think it's stellar.

859
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,400
Apart from the one obvious
tiny little baby little hiccup.

860
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,700
- I don't play a musical instrument?
- Yes, sir.

861
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,700
A tiny, insignificant detail.

862
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,900

(Music) You look into my eyes

864

865

866

874
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,000
I suppose I'd better do the duty round.

875

You're a saint.

Any chance of a dance with the boss?

Yeah, sure, sure.

879
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,600
As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.

880
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,400
Not my boyfriend.

881

(Music) Waiting for the spring

933
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,800
(Music) I'm just sitting here

934
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,800
(Music) Waiting for you to come on home

935
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,200
(Music) And turn me on

936
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,100
(Music) Turn me on (Music)

937
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,400
Well, then. I'd better go.

938
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,500
OK.

939
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

940
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,400
Actually...

941
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,800
- I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

942
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
- I mean...
- No, that's good.

943
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,500
Just, erm, would you excuse me
for one second?

944
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,200
- Sure.
- Just one second.

945
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,000
Erm, OK, that's done. Erm...

946
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,200
Why don't you come upstairs
in about ten seconds?

947
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,600
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

963
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,300
l-I'd better answer that.

964
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,700
Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

965
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,800
No, no, I'm not busy. No, fire away.

966
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,800
Right.

967
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,800
Yes, I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible

968
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,600
to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...

969
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:39,200
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's very good
at exorcism but...

970
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,300
Well, I'm sure...

971
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,100
Jon Bon Jovi is as well
and I'll definitely look into it.

972
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,700
OK? OK, I'll talk to you later.

973
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,900
All right, bye-bye.

974
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,200
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

975
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,200
It's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.

976
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,700
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

977
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,000
I mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is,

978
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,800
and there being no parents now
and us being over here,

979
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,200
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job, obviously, I'm glad to do it...

980
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,100
That's OK. Life is full
of interruptions and complications.

981
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,400
So...

982
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,300
(Mobile)

983
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,400
Will it make him better?

984
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,600
No.

985
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,600
Then maybe...

986
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,600
don't answer.

987
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Hey. How you doing?

988
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,300
Right, right. Oh, no, please.

989
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh, please, please don't, little darling.

990
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:22,300
Between the two of us we'll find the answer
and it won't hurt any more.

991
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,500
No, no.

992
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,600
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

993
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,600
Of course, if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

994
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,200
OK.

995
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,000
That was a good night.

996
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,700
- Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

997
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,500
It's true.

998
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,600
Nowadays the only clothes I can get into
were once owned by Pavarotti.

999
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,700
I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

1000
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,400
Mia's very pretty.

1001
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Is she?

1002
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,700
You know she is, darling.

1003
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,000
Be careful there.

1004
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,900
Have you been watching stuff on TV?

1005
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,900
Yeah.

1006
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,900
- Every night.
- Good.

1007
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,200
And every day.

1008
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,000
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.

1009
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,200
Thank you.

1010
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,400
Don't do that, my darling.

1011
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,800
Thank you.

1012
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Don't do that.

1013
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,200
(Dog barking in distance)

1014
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,100
Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping,
never easy or pleasant.

1015
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,100
Are you gonna get me something?

1016
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,300
Er...

1017
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,900
I don't know, I hadn't thought.

1018
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,900
Where's Sarah, by the way?

1019
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,600
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

1020
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,400
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

1021
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,600
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

1022
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,100
A lot.

1023
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,400
Are you gonna give me something?

1024
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,100
I thought I made it clear last night.

1025
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,800
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

1026
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,400
So, erm, what do you need?

1027
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,700
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

1028
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,200
No. I don't want something I need.

1029
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,700
I want something I want. Something pretty.

1030
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,900
Right.

1031
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Right.

1032
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,100
Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

1033
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,600
Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied

1034
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,800
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

1035
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1036
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,700
Looking for anything in particular, sir?

1037
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,500
Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

1038
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,700
It's £270.

1039
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,200
- Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1040
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,300
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

1041
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,200
- Yes, all right.
- Lovely.

1042
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,500
Let me just pop it in the box.

1043
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,700
There.

1044
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,200
- Look, could we be quite quick?
- Certainly, sir.

1045
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,200
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1046
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,400
- There.
- That's great.

1047
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,200
Not quite finished.

1048
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,300
- I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

1049
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,800
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1050
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,800
Ooh!

1051
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,500
Could we be quite quick, please?

1052
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,300
Prontissimo.

1053
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,400
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.

1054
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,900
- Actually, I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it, sir.

1055
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,400
Want to bet?

1056
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1057
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,600
There we go. Almost finished.

1058
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:11,000
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1059
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,300
No, sir, we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1060
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,000
I don't want a Christmas box.

1061
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,800
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1062
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,700
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1063
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,400
- All we need now...
- Oh, God.

1064
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,700
...is a sprig of holly.
- No, no, no, no.

1065
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,800
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1066
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,500
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1067
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,500
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1068
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,200
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

1069
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,900
after 13 years of
Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.

1070
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,100
Actually, I do love this one.

1074

- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1075
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,300
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1076
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,700
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1077
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,500
I bloody am.

1078
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,900
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1079
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1080
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,500
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1081
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,900
(Clears throat) Look, erm...

1082
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,800
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1083
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,400
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink,
do you? I mean, nothing implied.

1084
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:32,100
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1085
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,500
Obviously, if you don't want to,
you don't have to. I...

01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,300
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1087
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,100
No. That would be lovely.

1088
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,500
Oh, great.

1089
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,200
Yay!

1090
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,400
You know, that is really great.

1091
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,400
Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages
to get the courage up, so thank you.

1092
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,700
(Repetitive drumbeats)

1093
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,200
- Explain again why you're so late.
- Can't a man have any secrets?

1094
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,500
We've been waiting for hours,
it's the first ever preview.

1095
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,700
(Music)... is a thing of the past

1096
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,200
(Music) Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1097
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,300
(Music) Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared... (Music)

1098
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,400
(Karen) It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1099
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,600
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1100
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,400
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1101
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,500
(Russian) Is this the way to the train station?

1102
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,700
I would like half-pint of churly.

1103
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,600
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1104
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,300
(Portuguese) Oh, my God,
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1105
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,700
It must have been the prawns.

1106
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,300
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1107
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,600
(Portuguese) My goodness,
this is a very big fish!

1108
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,800
It tastes delicious!

1109
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,600
(Music) All alone on Christmas

1110
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,300
(Music) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1111
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,200
(Music) All alone on Christmas
(Music) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1112
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,800
(Music) Tell me I've got to know

1113
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,500
(Music) Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
(Music) Don't leave me alone (Music)

1114
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:24,300
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah, back broken from too much sex.

1115
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,900
You are on the road to disaster.

1116
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,400
No, I am on shag highway, heading west.

1117
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,000
Farewell, failure.

1118
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,900
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1119
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,600
(Music) And he's got a big knob (Music)

1120
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,600
((Music) Santana Featuring Rob Thomas:
Smooth)

1121
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,900
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1122
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,300
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1123
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,100
(On jukebox) (Music) Man, it's a hot one

1124
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,400
(Music) Like seven inches
from the midday sun... (Music)

1125
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,200
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please.

1126
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,700
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1127
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,000
Oh, my God.

1128
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,900
Are you from England?

1129
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,000
- Yes.
- Oh...

1130
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,000
that is so cute.

1131
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,700
Hi, I'm Stacey. (Giggles)

1132
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,900
Jeannie?

1133
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,900
Yeah?

1134
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,700
- This is...
- Colin.

1135
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,500
Frissell.

1136
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,700
Cute name.

1137
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,500
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1138
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,800
Yep. Basildon.

1139
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,800
- Oh.
- Oh.

1140
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,700
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1141
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,000
(Stacey) Uh-huh.

1142
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:05,000
- Hey, girls.
- Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1143
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,700
He's from England.

1144
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,900
Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.

1145
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,700
- Hey, gorgeous.
- (Gentle growl)

1146
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
That is so funny!

1147
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,300
- What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.

1148
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,500
(With English accent) "Bottle."

1149
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,600
- What about this?
- Er, straw.

1150
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,600
(Girls) "Straw."

1151
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,600
- What about this?
- Table.

1152
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,900
- Table. The same.
- Oh, it's the same.

1153
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,300
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1154
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,300
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1155
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,600
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1156
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,300
No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1157
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,000
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1158
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,300
Well, if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1160
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,300
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1161
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
What?

1162
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,200
Well, we're not the richest of girls,
you know.

1163
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,200
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1164
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,700
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1165
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:23,000
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1166
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,000
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1167
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,500
No?

1168
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,100
Which means...

1169
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,300
we would be naked.

1170
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,700
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1171
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,200
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...

1172
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,300
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1173
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,600
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1174
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,500
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1175
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,800
Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her
cos she is "the sexy one".

1176
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,700
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1177
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,600
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh, and he's a Christian.

1178
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,700
(AIl) Cheers.

1179
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,300
(Music) If I could

1180
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
(Music) Then I would

1181
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:13,700
(Music) I'll go wherever you will go

1182
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,900
(Music) Way up high

1183
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,100
(Music) Or down low

1184
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,300
(Music) I'll go wherever you will go

1185
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,700
(Music) If I could turn back... (Music)

1186
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,000
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1187
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,100
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1188
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,300
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no. I want to choose mine.

1189
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,600
I think I want...

1190
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,500
...this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well

1191
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,600
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1192
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,800
Thank you.

1193
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,000
That's a real first.

1194
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,500
- Rip it!
- What is it?

1195
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,100
I'm going to... All right, I'll rip it.

1196
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,100
God, that's a surprise.

1197
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,100
(Daisy) What is it?

1198
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,700
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell, wow.

1199
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,100
To continue your emotional education.

1200
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,400
Yes.

1201
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,900
Goodness.

1202
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,900
That's great.

1203
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,900
- My brilliant wife.
- Ah, yes.

1204
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,400
Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself
for a second?

1205
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,500
All that ice cream. Er...

1206
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,800
Darling, could you make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1207
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
- Back in a minute.
- (Harry to kids) All right, take it easy.

1208
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,400
(Bernie) Mine first. Mine.

1209
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,600
((Music) Joni Mitchell: Both Sides Now)
(Music) Moons and Junes

1210
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,000
(Music) And Ferris wheels

1211
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,600
(Music) The dizzy dancing way that you feel

1212
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:01,800
(Music) As every fairy tale comes real

1213
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,700
(Music) I've looked at love that way

1214
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,100
(Music) But now it's just another show

1215
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,800
(Music) And you leave 'em laughing when you go

1216
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,900
(Music) And if you care

1217
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,300
(Music) Don't let them know

1218
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,200
(Music) Don't give yourself away

1219
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,400
(Music) I've looked at love

1220
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,400
(Music) From both sides now

1221
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,600
(Music) From give and take

1222
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,900
(Music) And still somehow

1223
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:52,200
(Music) It's love's illusions that I recall

1224
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,600
(Music) I really don't know love

1225
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,600
(Music) I really don't know love at all

1226
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,700
(Music) Tears and fears

1227
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,500
(Music) And feeling proud

1228
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:26,600
(Music) To say I love you right out loud

1229
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,500
(Music) Dreams and schemes

1230
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,300
(Music) And circus crowds

1231
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,800
(Music) I've looked at life that way

1232
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,500
(Music) Oh but now old friends... (Music)

1233
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,200
Oh, my God.

1234
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,300
It's a miracle. You're all dressed.

1235
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,400
Come on, come on, come on,
we're horribly late.

1236
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,900
Come on, then. In the car. In the car.

1237
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,000
(Music) Well something's lost

1238
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,000
(Music) But something's gained

1239
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,600

01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,000
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1241
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:10,600
But the thing about romance is people
only get together right at the very end.

1242
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,000
Of course.

1243
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,800
By the way, I feel bad. I never ask you
how your love life is going.

1244
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:20,000
Er-huh!

1245
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,900
No.

1246
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,800
As you know,
that was a done deal long ago.

1247
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:31,000
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case
I want you out of here straightaway,

1248
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,400
- you wee motherless mongrel.
- Oh!

1249
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,300
No, no. We'll want to have sex
in every room, including yours.

(Male DJ)
'It's a rainy Christmas Eve all over the UK

1251
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,300
'and the question is who is number one
on the Radio One chart show tonight?

1252
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,300
'Is it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?

1253
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,300
'You might have guessed it
although you may not believe it.

1254
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,700
'It's Billy Mack.'

1255
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,600
- You are the champion!
- (Crowd) Shh.

1256
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,600
- 'Hi, Billy.'
- Hello.

1257
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,400
'We're live across the nation
and you're number one.

1258

- 'How will you be celebrating? '
- I don't know.

1259
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,300
Er, either I could behave like
a real rock'n'roll loser

1260
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,100
and get drunk with my fat manager...

1261
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,400
or, when I hang up,

1262
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,300
I'll be flooded by invitations
to a large number of glamorous parties.

'Let's hope it's the latter. Here it is.

Hello. Elton.

1268
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,600
O-Of course. Of course.

1269
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,100
Send an embarrassingly big car
and I'll be there.

(Crowd laughing)

1271
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,500
It's gonna be a very good Christmas.

(Cheering)

1273
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,400
- Right.
- I'd better be getting inside, actually.

1274
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,600
- My mum and... you know.
- Of course, yeah. It's getting a bit cold.

1275
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,200
Erm...

1276

- Well, good night.
- Night.

Er...

1278
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Er... OK.

1279
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,400
All I want for Christmas...

1280
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,000
- is you.
- (Laughs nervously)

1281
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,700
Right.

1282

Thank you. Good.

Oh, look, everyone, it's Uncle Jamie.

Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1289

Yes, oh, splendid. It's lovely to see you all.

Sorry.

1294

Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

1295
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,600
I hate Uncle Jamie!

Sam, I've done chicken kebabs.

- Oh, hi.
- (Peter) Who is it?

1330
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,400
It's carol singers.

1331
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
Give them a quid and tell them to bugger off.

(Doorbell)

1357
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,100
What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at Elton John's.

1358
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:10,400
Well, I was there for a minute or two
and then I had an epiphany.

1359
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

1360
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,100
Come on. Just come up.

1361
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,300
So what was this epiphany?

1362
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,100
Erm, it... it was about Christmas.

1363
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,500
You realised it was all around.

1364
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,900
No. I realised that Christmas is the time
to be with the people you love.

1365
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,600
Right.

1366
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:37,300
And I realised that, as dire chance
and fateful cockup would have it,

1367
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,500
here I am,

1368
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,900
mid-fifties,

1369
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,100
and without knowing it,
I've spent most of my adult life

1370
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:49,000
with a chubby employee. (Snorts)

1371
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,800
And, much as it grieves me to say it,

1372
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,500
it might be that the people I love is, in fact...

1373
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,700
you.

1374
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,000
Well, this is a surprise.

1375
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,800
Yeah.

1376
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,100
Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?

1377
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,200
No, look. I'm serious here.

1378
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:17,000
I left Elton's and a hefty number
of half-naked chicks with their mouths open

1379
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,500
in order to hang out with you at Christmas.

1380
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,400
- Well, Bill...
- It's a terrible, terrible mistake, chubs...

1381
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,700
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1382
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,100
And to be honest,
despite all my complaining...

1383
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,500
we have had a wonderful life.

1384
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,700
Well...

1385
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,700
thank you.

1386
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,400
I mean, come on, it's been an honour.

1387
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,300
I feel very proud.

1388
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,500
Oh, look, don't be a moron.

1389
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,400
(Clears throat)

1390
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,800
Come on, let's get pissed and watch porn.

1391
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,800
(Natalie) 'Dear sir, Dear David,

a very happy New Year.

'if you can't say it at Christmas,
when can you, eh? -

1397
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,600
'I'm actually yours. With love, your Natalie.'

1398
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,900
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1399
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Right now. Thank you.

1400

((Music) Pointer Sisters: Jump)

1401
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,900
Oh, don't wait up.

1402
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,100
I'd like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.

1403
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,400
Very good, sir.

1404
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:53,000
(Music) Tell me how you want me

1405
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,700
(Music) I can feel it in your heart beat

1406
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,900
(Music) I know you like what you see... (Music)

1407
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,800
(Terry) Harris Street. What number, sir?

1408
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,700
(David) Oh, God, it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

1409
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,800
(Music) Wrap your love around me

1410
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,900
(Music) You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter (Music)

1411
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,900
(Doorbell)

1412
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,900
Hello, does Natalie live here?

1413
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:21,400
- No.
- Right, fine, thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1414
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,600
Here, aren't...

1415
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,000
Aren't you the Prime Minister?

1416
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:31,700
- Er, yes. In fact, I am. Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

1417
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:35,600
Part of the service now. Trying to get round
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1418
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,900
(Doorbell)

1419
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,300
Ah. Hello. Does Natalie live here?

1420
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,000
- No, she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

1421
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:49,300
- Are you singing carols?
- Er, no. No, I'm not.

1422
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,600
- Please, sir, please.
- Please.

1423
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,400
Well, I suppose I could.

1424
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,300
Please.

1425
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,800
- All right.

1431

- (Doorbell)
- Hello. Sorry to disturb.

1432
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,300
- Does Natalie live here?
- No.

1433
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,500
She lives next door.

1434
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,600
Ah. Brilliant.

1435
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:38,600
You're not who I think you are, are you?

1436
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,900
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1437
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,300
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

1438
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,600
Merry Christmas to you.

1439
01:44:59,300 --> 01:44:59,900
(Doorbell)

1440
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:05,200
- (Chatting stops suddenly)
- Ah. Hello.

1441
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,600
Is, er, Natalie in?

1442
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,400
Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1443
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:15,700
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1444
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:20,800
Erm, this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1445
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:23,000
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1446
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,800
And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.

1447
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:29,700
Yes, we can see that, darling.

1448
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,700
And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

1449
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,800
It's the school Christmas concert,
you see, David.

1450
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,300
All the local schools have joined together,
even St Basil's...

1451
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:43,100
- Too much detail, Mum.
- Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1452
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,100
Well, I... just needed Natalie...

1453
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:52,100
on some state business.

1454
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:56,700
- Oh.
- Right, yes. Of course.

1455
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,600
Right, er...

1456
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,300
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1457
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,800
Er, Natalie.

1458
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:05,400
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1459
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:09,000
- No, it's nothing, really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1460
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:13,300
- No, really, it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1461
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,400
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1462
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,000
Mm. Erm...

1463
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,900
Listen, why don't I give you a lift

1464
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:27,000
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1465
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,200
OK.

1466
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,000
- Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.

1467
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,300
Hold tight, everybody.

1468
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:44,700
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1469
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,400
Ah, right. Well, er...

1470
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,600
I just wanted to say...

1471
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,700
thank you for the Christmas card.

1472
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,600
You're welcome.

1473
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,600
Look, I'm so sorry about that day.

1474
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:02,900
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1475
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:07,400
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened, I promise.

1476
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,700
I just felt like such a fool because...

1477
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:14,000
I think about you all the time, actually.

1478
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,400
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1479
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,300
...Iove.
- Oh, wow.

1480
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,900
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1481
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,700
Erm...

1482
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,400
Ow!

1483
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:36,900
(Sighs)

1484
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,300
Well, look, I...

1485
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,500
I think I'd better not come in, you know?

1486
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:48,100
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1487
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,700
No, please come. It'll be great.

1488
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,500
No, I'd... I'd better not.

1489
01:47:55,700 --> 01:48:00,300
But I will be very sorry

1490
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,600
to drive away from you.

1491
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,300
Just give me one second.

1492
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:23,300
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1493
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,500
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1494
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,700
No!

1495
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:06,700
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1496
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,900
OK. Terry, I won't be long.

1497
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,300
Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

1498
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:19,500
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1499
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,500
Look, the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1500
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,500
- Oh, David.
- Ah!

1501
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,000
Oh, how are you?

1502
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:36,100
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1503
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,300
What the hell are you doing here?

1504
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,300
- Well, you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1505
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,100
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1506
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,200
I thought it was time I did.

1507
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:51,500
I didn't want anyone to see,
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1508
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,100
Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

1509
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:57,900
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1510
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,200
- Thank you.
- All right.

1511
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:04,300
Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

1512
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:07,400
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1513
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,600
- Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.

1514
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,800
And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...

1515
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,700
- who's my, erm, catering manager.
- Oh.

1516
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,800
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1517
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1518
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:21,200
20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

1519
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:26,100
I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir,
just because it's Christmas.

1520
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,400
- No, seriously.
- (Bell)

1521
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,900
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.

1522
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,600
- Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.

1523
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:36,600
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

1524
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,800
- Come on.
- Right.

1525
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,100
(Music) Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

1526
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,800
(Music) Save it for a rainy day

1527
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:50,900
(Music) Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket

1528
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,100
(Music) Never let it fade away

1529
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,300
(Music) Never let it fade away

1530
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:05,000
(Music) Never let it fade away (Music)

1531
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,300
(Cheering, applause)

1532
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:16,300
Hillier School would now like to present
their Christmas number.

1533
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,400
Lead vocals by ten-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

1534
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,100
backing vocals coordinated by her mother,

1535
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,400
the great Mrs Jean Anderson.

1536
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:27,300
Erm, some of the staff
have decided to help out

1537
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,800
and for this, we ask you to forgive us.

1538
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,900
Thank you.

1539
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,800
(Applause)

1540
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:43,100
(A capella) (Music) I don't want a lot for Christmas

1541
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:47,400
(Music) There's just one thing I need

1542
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,900
(Music) I don't care about the presents

1543
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:54,900
(Music) Underneath the Christmas tree

1544
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,500
(Music) I just want you for my own

1545
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,500
(Music) More than you could ever know

1546
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:06,400
(Music) Make my wish come true

1547
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:10,600
(Music) All I want for Christmas

1548
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:18,300
(Music) Is you

1549
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,200
(Music) I don't want a lot for Christmas

1550
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,500
(Music) There's just one thing I need

1551
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:29,500
(Music) I don't care about the presents

1552
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,700
(Music) Underneath the Christmas tree

1553
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,200
(Music) I just want you for my own

1554
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:39,200
(Music) More than you could ever know

1555
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,300
(Music) Make my wish come true

1556
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:47,100
(Music) All I want for Christmas is you

1557
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,000
(Music) You baby

1558
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:55,000
(Music) Oh, all the lights are shining

1559
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:59,200
(Music) So brightly everywhere

1560
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,000
(Music) And the sound of children's laughter
fills the air

1561
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,500
(Music) Laughter fills the air

1562
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,500
(Music) Everyone is singing
(Music) Oh yeah

1563
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,900
(Music) I hear those sleigh bells ringing

1564
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:13,800
(Music) Santa won't you bring me my honey

1565
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,400
(Music) Won't you please bring my baby to me

1566
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:20,400
(Music) I don't want a lot for Christmas

1567
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:23,900
(Music) This is all I'm asking for
(Music) All I'm asking for

1568
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,000
(Music) I just wanna see my baby

1569
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:30,200
(Music) Standing right outside my door

1570
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,900
(Music) Cos I just want you for my own

1571
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:36,300
(Music) More than you could ever know
(Music) You will ever know

1572
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,700
(Music) Make my wish come true

1573
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:43,900
(Music) All I want for Christmas

1574
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:47,600
(Music) Is you

1575
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:50,000
(Music) All I want for Christmas

1576
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,500
(Music) And you and you

1577
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,600
(Music) And you and you
(Music) All I want for Christmas

1578
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,900
(Music) All I want for Christmas (Music)

1579
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,500
(Cheering, whistling)

1580
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,300
Right.

1581
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,700
So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1582
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,000
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1583
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,100
Little bow.

1584
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,700
And a wave.

1585
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:52,300
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1586
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,400
I'll see you later, all right?

1587
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,600
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1588
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:03,200
Tell me, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

1589
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,300
What position is that?

1590
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,100
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1591
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:12,300
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1592
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,100
- Oh, Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1593
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,800
- Good night.
- Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1594
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,800
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1595
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:23,400
or if it's sex and a necklace

1596
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:27,100
or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?

1597
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:33,400
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1598
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:37,100
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.

1599
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,500
I am so in the wrong.

1600
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,600
A classic fool.

1601
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,800
Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.

1602
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,700
You've made the life I lead foolish, too.

1603
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,200
Darling. Ooh, darlings!

1604
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:01,400
Oh, you were wonderful.

1605
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,500
My little lobster, you were so...

1606
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,800
What is that word?

1607
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,100
Orange.

1608
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:12,300
Come on, I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1609
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:18,400
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, son.

1610
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:22,600
- Thanks. Plan didn't work, though.
- Tell her, then.

1611
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,600
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1612
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,600
No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

1613
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:32,900
Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1614
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:36,900
I never told your mum enough.

1615
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,300
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1616
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,700
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1617
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:53,400
OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1618
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,900
Yes.

1619
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:58,300
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1620
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:02,600
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1621
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,800
That's OK.

1622
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,300
- My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn't.

1623
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:11,400
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1624
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:14,300
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1625
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,200
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1626
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,000
Carol.

1627
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:23,400
- OK, I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1628
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:27,100
I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1629
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,400
Carol. (Laughs)

1630
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:35,400
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1631
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,100
(Carol laughs)

1632
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,400
- Tell her.
- What?

1633
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,400
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1634
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,200
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

1635
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,500
Over there.

1636
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,400
Oh, no.

1637
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,500
It's OK, we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1638
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,900
(Portuguese) Good evening.

1639
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,900
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1640
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:28,600
I am here to ask your daughter

1641
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,700
for her hands in marriage.

1642
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,900
You want to marry my daughter?

1643
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:34,900
Yes.

1644
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,500
Come here,

1645
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,100
there is a man at the door.

1646
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:41,800
He wants to marry you.

1647
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,300
But I've never seen him before.

1648
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,700
Who cares?

1649
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:47,000
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1650
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,000
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1651
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:54,700
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1652
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,600
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1653
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,300
You! Stay here.

1654
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:03,100
As if I would. Stupid!

1655
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:10,800
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1656
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
Wait. Wait.

1657
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,600
Oh, no.

1658
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,000
You better not say yes, Father.

1659
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:28,000
Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1660
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:36,700
- Look, we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1661
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,100
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1662
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,900
No.

1663
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:50,200
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

1664
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:53,800
Just a moment, I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1665
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,900
- Unless...
- What?

1666
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,500
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1667
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,100
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1668
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:04,800
- OK.
- Yes!

1669
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,200
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1670
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,200
(Beeping)

1671
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,700
(Inaudible through glass)

1672
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,300
(Chattering excitedly)

1673
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:24,700
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1674
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:27,000
Cool!

1675
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,300
Joanna.

1676
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,400
Sam?

1677
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:13,900
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1678
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:17,600
Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

1679
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:12,800
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1680
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:14,900
This man wants to marry her.

1681
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,700
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1682
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,500
Boa noite, Aurelia.

1683
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Boa noite, Jamie.

1684
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:00,300
Beautiful Aurelia...

1685
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:04,500
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1686
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:07,800
to marriage me.

1687
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:13,900
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1688
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:22,500
but sometimes things are so transparency,

1689
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:27,400
they don't need evidential proof.

1690
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:35,200
And I will inhabit here,
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1691
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,900
Definitely go for England, girl.

1692
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,200
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1693
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:48,100
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me,

1694
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,700
and of course I prediction you say no...

1695
02:04:55,100 --> 02:05:02,600
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

1696
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,700
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1697
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,500
(English) Thank you.

1698
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,500
That will be nice.

1699
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,500
Yes is being my answer.

1700
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:28,400
Easy question.

1701
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:31,000
(Portuguese) What did you say?

1702
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,400
Yes, of course.

1703
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,100
(Cheering)

1704
