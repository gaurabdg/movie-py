3
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,268
You're live in two minutes,
Your Royal Highness.

4
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,613
Sir?

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,611
Thank you.

6
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,662
Let the microphone do the work, sir.

7
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,711
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.

8
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,181
Time to go.

9
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,524
Good afternoon.

10
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,528
This is the BBC National Programme
and Empire Service

11
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,827
taking you to Wembley Stadium
for the closing ceremony

12
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,825
of the Empire Exhibition,

13
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,828
where His Royal Highness,
the Duke of York,

14
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,788
will read a message from his father,
His Majesty King George V.

15
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,170
Fifty-eight British colonies
and dominions have taken part,

16
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,344
making this the largest exhibition
staged anywhere in the world.

17
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,174
Remember, sir, three flashes,
then steady red means you're live.

18
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,384
Using the new invention of radio,

19
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,687
the opening ceremony was the first time
His Majesty the King

20
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,686
addressed his subjects on the wireless.

21
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,063
At the close of the first season,

22
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,362
the heir to the throne,
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,283
made his first broadcast, and today,

24
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,862
his younger brother,
His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,

25
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,075
will give his inaugural broadcast
to the nation and the world.

26
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,478
I have received...

27
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:38,120
...from His Majesty the...

28
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,672
...the...

29
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,422
...the...

30
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,597
...the King...

31
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,378
Inhale deep into your lungs,
Your Royal Highness.

32
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,374
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

33
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,462
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves,
and gives you Confidence.

34
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:42,552
Now, if Your Royal Highness
would be so kind as to open your hand.

35
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,273
Sterilized.

36
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,322
One, two,

37
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,651
three, four,

38
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,237
five, six...

39
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,160
...seven. Now, if I may take the
liberty, insert them into your mouth.

40
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,831
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?

41
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,214
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.

42
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,388
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it worked since?

43
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:25,435
Now, if you would be
so kind as to read.

44
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,850
"A wealth of words."

45
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,606
Fight against those marbles,
Your Royal Highness.

46
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,243
Enunciate.

47
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,668
A little more concentration,
Your Royal Highness.

48
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,500
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

49
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,257
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...

50
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,056
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.

51
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:10,306
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.

52
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,689
Tick, took. Tick, took.

53
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,864
You know you can't
keep doing this, Bertie.

54
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,035
- I know.
- Mmm.

55
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,120
Promise me...

56
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,797
Promise me no more.

57
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,889
Ah!

58
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,506
Hello?

59
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,883
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.

60
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,774
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.

61
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,232
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.

62
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,068
"Poor and content
is rich and rich enough."

63
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,950
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare. How are you?

64
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,583
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.

65
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,413
Um, now, this is slightly awkward,
but I'm afraid you're late.

66
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,925
- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?

67
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,049
Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.

68
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,381
Well, that's not a very promising start.

69
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:55,062
No. No, look,
my husband has seen everyone.

70
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,764
To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.

71
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,272
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure of yourself.

72
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,900
Well, I'm sure of anyone
who wants to be cured.

73
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,074
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...

74
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,074
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs.

75
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,203
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?

76
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,206
Something of that nature, yes.

77
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,414
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.

78
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,296
Uh... Tuesday would be good.

79
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,219
He can give me his personal details,
I'll make a frank appraisal

80
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,888
- and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.

81
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,013
Uh, I don't have a "hubby."
We don't "pop."

82
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,471
And nor do we ever talk about
our private lives.

83
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,602
No, you must come to us.

84
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,981
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson,
my game, my turf, my rules.

85
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,185
Mmm.

86
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,987
You'll have to talk this over
with your husband,

87
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,440
and then you can speak to me
on the telephone.

88
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:52,118
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.

89
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,040
And what if my husband
were the Duke of York?

90
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:02,462
- The Duke of York?
- Yes. The Duke of York.

91
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,634
I thought the appointment
was for Johnson. Forgive me, Your...

92
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,845
- Royal Highness.
- ...Royal Highness.

93
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,272
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great
War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy

94
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,022
- to know he was aboard.
- Am I considered the enemy?

95
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,854
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.

96
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,441
You'll appreciate the need
for absolute discretion.

97
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,618
Of course.

98
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,617
How did you find me,
Your Royal Highness?

99
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,700
The President of The Society
For Speech Therapists.

100
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,581
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.

101
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
She warned me your Antipodean methods

102
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,046
were both "unorthodox"
and "controversial."

103
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,845
I warned her those
are not my favorite words.

104
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,548
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,

105
00:11:54,631 --> 00:12:00,388
I need trust and total equality, here
in the safety of my consultation room.

106
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,431
No exceptions.

107
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,981
Oh, well. In that case...

108
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,076
When can you start?

109
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,299
- She's still sounding a bit rough.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad.

110
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,095
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.

111
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,389
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

112
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,343
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?

113
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,895
You must stay, bored stupid, listening
to your parents' inane conversation.

114
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,188
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.

115
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,561
- And Mum.
- Me, too.

116
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,190
- You meeting Jean?
- No. Someone else.

117
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,406
- Doctor? Doctor?
- Hmm?

118
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,233
Go and help your brother
with the washing up.

119
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,035
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?

120
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,406
Why bring it up
if you can't talk about it?

121
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,128
Myrtle, it's just a woman
looking to help her husband.

122
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,797
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.

123
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,840
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?

124
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,382
Could be a lot of fun.

125
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,462
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

126
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,550
In the amateur scene,
they're a highly regarded group.

127
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,472
From Putney.

128
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,977
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."

129
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,979
Mama,
I long to know where they fly to.

130
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,481
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.

131
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,905
Weren't they lucky?

132
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,857
Now Papa, tell a story.

133
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,536
Can't I be a penguin instead?

134
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,955
Well, no, I want a penguin story.

135
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,880
Very quickly.

136
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,007
Once there were...
two princesses.

137
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,184
Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret,

138
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,762
whose papa was a penguin.

139
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,476
This was because he'd been
turned into one by a wicked witch.

140
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,277
This was very inconvenient for him
because he loved...

141
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,194
...to hold his princesses in his arms.

142
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,951
But you can't if you're a penguin
because you...

143
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,869
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.

144
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,206
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.

145
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:40,722
And what made matters worse is that
she... she sent him to the South Pole,

146
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,641
which is an awfully long walk back if...

147
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,014
...if you can't fly.

148
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,564
So when he reached the water, he...

149
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,687
...he dived in, through the depths,

150
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,145
so fast that he was in
Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

151
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,074
And from there,
he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,

152
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,743
changed at Clapham Junction, asked a...

153
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,242
...a passing mallard the way
to Buckingham Palace,

154
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,416
swam up The Thames,
out through the plughole

155
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:13,418
and gave the cook, Mama
and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.

156
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,591
Now, when the girls
heard all the commotion,

157
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,761
they ran to the kitchen,
where they gave him a...

158
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,931
...a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

159
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,975
And as they kissed him...

160
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,515
...guess what he turned into?

161
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,349
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.

162
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,153
- Oh.
- With wings so big,

163
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:41,449
that he could wrap them both around
his two girls together.

164
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,777
Now, girls. Time for bed. Come on.

165
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,828
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.

166
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,997
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.

167
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,120
Feed them, brush them and to bed.

168
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,380
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.

169
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:01,298
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?

170
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,800
No. About her.

171
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,348
- A married woman? He can't be.
- She can.

172
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,771
By the way, I think I've found
someone rather interesting.

173
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,394
On Harley Street. Doctor.

174
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,693
Out of the question.

175
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,317
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat... Matter's settled.

176
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,148
Mmm. His approach
seems rather different.

177
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,402
Now?

178
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,409
Now.

179
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,295
Now is the winter of our discontent,

180
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,174
made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

181
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,972
And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

182
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,676
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

183
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,980
Now are our brows bound
with... victorious...

184
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,773
Thank you.

185
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,523
- Lovely diction, Mr...
- Logue. Lionel Logue.

186
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,233
Well, Mr. Logue,

187
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,196
I'm not hearing the cries
of a deformed creature

188
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,906
yearning to be king.

189
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,540
Nor did I realize Richard III
was King of the Colonies.

190
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,252
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.

191
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,052
- Sydney?
- Perth.

192
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,300
Major theater town, is it?

193
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,350
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.

194
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,177
I was well reviewed.

195
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,227
Yes.

196
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:42,312
Well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic society

197
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,524
is looking for someone slightly younger.

198
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:51,079
And a... little more regal.

199
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,335
- There you are.
- Thank you.

200
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,256
- Oh.
- Mmm.

201
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,675
No, you have to shut that one first.

202
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,799
Close that one first. That's it.

203
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,849
Where did you find this... physician?

204
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,679
Classifieds. Next to a
"French model, Shepherd's Market."

205
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,263
No, he comes highly recommended.

206
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,565
Charges substantial fees
to help the poor.

207
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,564
Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.

208
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,608
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.

209
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,205
Uh... The Johnsons.

210
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,632
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.

211
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:53,433
Lionel says wait here
if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.

212
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,602
Or, it being a...

213
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,807
...pleasant day...

214
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,272
...perhaps take a stroll.

215
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,739
Was that all right, Lionel?

216
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,743
Marvelous, Willie.

217
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,119
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

218
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,368
Mrs. Johnson.

219
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,335
Mr. Johnson. Do come in.

220
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,691
Would you like a sweetie?

221
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,190
He's a good lad, Willie.

222
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,569
He could hardly make a sound, you know,
when he first came to me.

223
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,875
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?

224
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,292
Please, make yourself comfortable.

225
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,265
I was told not to sit too close.

226
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,528
I believe when speaking with a prince,

227
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,531
one waits for the prince
to choose the topic.

228
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,581
Waiting for me to...

229
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,838
...commence a conversation,
one can wait rather a long wait.

230
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,840
Ah, yes, well...

231
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,260
Do you know any jokes?

232
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:13,782
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?

233
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:18,077
- No. No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.

234
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,714
Aren't you going to start treating me,
Dr. Logue?

235
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,842
Only if you're interested
in being treated.

236
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,596
Please, call me Lionel.

237
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,928
No, I... prefer Doctor.

238
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,560
I prefer Lionel.

239
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,148
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.

240
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,906
Then... it's "sir" after that.

241
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,826
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.

242
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,953
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur...

243
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,123
...George.

244
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,118
How about Bertie?

245
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,503
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.

246
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,086
In here, it's better if we're equals.

247
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:25,808
If... if we were equals,
I wouldn't be here.

248
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,767
I'd be... at home with my wife,

249
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,978
and no one would give a damn.

250
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,188
Please, don't do that.

251
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,693
I'm sorry?

252
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,868
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs,
well, it will kill you.

253
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,447
My physicians say it relaxes the...

254
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,407
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.

255
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,495
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.

256
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,749
My castle, my rules.

257
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,262
Thank you.

258
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,390
What was your earliest memory?

259
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,728
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.

260
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,305
I'm not...

261
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,025
...here to discuss personal matters.

262
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,651
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!

263
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:22,736
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.

264
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,705
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.

265
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,953
- I doubt that.
- Don't...

266
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,078
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.

267
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,166
I can assure you, no infant
starts to speak with a stammer.

268
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,250
When did yours start?

269
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,385
- Four or five.
- That's typical.

270
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,388
So I've been told.

271
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,061
I... I can't remember not doing it.

272
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,766
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?

273
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:57,194
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?

274
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,361
Everyone natters to themselves
occasionally, Bertie.

275
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,283
Stop... Stop calling me that.

276
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,736
I'm not going to call you anything else.

277
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:09,699
Then we shan't speak.

278
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,929
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

279
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,141
A fortune.

280
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,358
I'll just let that brew.

281
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:41,731
So... when you talk to yourself,
do you stammer?

282
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,489
No... of course not.

283
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,990
Well, that proves that your impediment
isn't a permanent part of you.

284
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,325
What do you think was the cause?

285
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,410
I don't... don't know.

286
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,963
I... I don't... I don't care.

287
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,715
I... I stammer.

288
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,003
No one can fix it.

289
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:08,717
I'll bet you that you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.

290
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,928
And if I win the bet,
I get to ask you more questions.

291
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,935
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.

292
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,645
One usually... wagers money.

293
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,105
A bob each to keep it sweet?

294
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:27,284
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.

295
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,828
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

296
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,373
I'll stake you, and you can
pay me back next time.

297
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,454
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.

298
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,002
So please stand, uh,
and take a look at that.

299
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,303
From there.

300
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,057
I... I can't read this.

301
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,639
Well, then you owe me
a shilling for not trying.

302
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,991
To be...

303
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,331
...or not to be, that...

304
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:23,333
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.

305
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,854
I'm going to record your voice and then
play it back to you on the same machine.

306
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,183
This is brilliant.
it's the latest thing from America.

307
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,733
It's a Silvertone.

308
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,239
Pop these on.

309
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,335
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.

310
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,590
- You're playing music!
- I know.

311
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,300
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

312
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,978
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing?

313
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,479
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

314
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,890
Hopeless.

315
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,142
Hopeless!

316
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,021
You were sublime.

317
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,192
Would I lie to a prince of the realm
to win 12 pennies?

318
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,739
I've no idea...

319
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,867
...what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.

320
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,944
Let me play it back to you.

321
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,284
No.

322
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,536
All right, then, well,
I get to ask you the questions.

323
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,086
Thank you, Doctor. I don't...

324
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,163
...feel this is for me.

325
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,218
Thank you for your time.

326
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,176
Goodbye.

327
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,842
Sir.

328
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,773
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.

329
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,953
No.

330
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,085
Oh, well.

331
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,379
Bugger.

332
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,854
For the present, the work
to which we are all equally bound

333
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,184
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility
within our borders,

334
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,522
to regain prosperity
at this time of depression

335
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,778
without self-seeking,
and to carry with us

336
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,986
those whom the burden of the past years

337
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,198
has disheartened or overborne.

338
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,754
To all, to each,
I wish a happy Christmas.

339
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,876
God bless you.

340
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,379
And off air.

341
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,134
Easy when you know how.

342
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,181
Sir?

343
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,767
Have a go yourself.

344
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,069
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.

345
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,648
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.

346
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,985
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.

347
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,490
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.

348
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,572
Sit up. Straight back.

349
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,784
Face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,

350
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,996
as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.

351
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,673
Papa, I don't... think I can read this.

352
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,174
This devilish device will change
everything if you don't.

353
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,677
In the past, all a king had to do
was look respectable in uniform

354
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,633
and not fall off his horse.

355
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,346
Now, we must invade people's homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

356
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:51,025
This family's been reduced to those
lowest, basest of all creatures.

357
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,851
We've become actors.

358
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,983
We're not a family, We're a firm.

359
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,033
Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.

360
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,031
Your darling brother and future king,

361
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,831
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another.

362
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,877
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.

363
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,376
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.

364
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,005
No divorced person
can ever be received at court.

365
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:22,056
He said it made him
sublimely happy.

366
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,851
I imagine that was
because she was sleeping with him.

367
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,724
"I give you my word,"
this is what he said.

368
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:32,354
"I give you my word,
we've never had immoral relations."

369
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,528
Stared square into
his father's face and lied.

370
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,856
When I'm dead,
that boy will ruin himself,

371
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,237
this family and this nation
within 12 months.

372
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,742
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.

373
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,074
Marshal Stalin the other half.

374
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,454
Who will stand between us,

375
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,584
the jackboots
and the proletarian abyss?

376
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,127
You?

377
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,591
Well?

378
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,264
With your older brother
shirking his duties,

379
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,842
you're going to have to do
a lot more of this.

380
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,723
Have a go yourself.

381
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,444
Through the...

382
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,397
- ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.

383
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,858
...one of the...

384
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,693
...marvels of...

385
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:31,413
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.

386
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,243
...science...

387
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,921
...I am enabled...

388
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,715
Relax.

389
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,260
Just try it!

390
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,213
...this Christmas Day...

391
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,844
...to speak to all my...

392
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,186
Do it!

393
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,061
Who 's Been Polishing the Sun ?

394
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,572
Lying... bastard.

395
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,226
- You're playing music.
- I know.

396
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,225
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?

397
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,558
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth 's doing.

398
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:41,612
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

399
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,825
”To be or not be,
that is the question.

400
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,878
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer

401
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,378
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

402
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,335
or to take arms
against a sea of troubles,

403
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,717
and by opposing end them ?

404
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,925
To die, to sleep no more,

405
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,886
and by a sleep to say the end

406
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,064
is the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks

407
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:22,770
the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless. "

408
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,738
Hopeless!

409
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,238
Strictly business. No...

410
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,284
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear

411
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,082
- in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?

412
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,661
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.

413
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,418
Besides, you... you tricked me.

414
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,091
Physical exercises
and tricks are important,

415
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,420
but what you're asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.

416
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,597
Is that sufficient? Uh, no.

417
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:56,520
As far as I see it, my husband has
mechanical difficulties with his speech.

418
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,439
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.

419
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,651


420
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:07,197
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.

421
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,948
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?

422
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,290
All right. You want mechanics?

423
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,539
We need to relax your jaw muscles,
strengthen your tongue,

424
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,340
by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.

425
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,293
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

426
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,798
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.

427
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,973
And you do have a flabby tummy,
so we'll need to spend some time

428
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,767
strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.

429
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,061
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.

430
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,480
Forget about the blessed shilling!

431
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,909
Perhaps, upon occasions...

432
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,411
...you might be requested to assist...

433
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,169
...in coping with...

434
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,797
...with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?

435
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,844
Of course.

436
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,595
Yes, and that would be the full extent
of your services.

437
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,679
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.

438
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,605
Feel the looseness of the jaw.

439
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,739
Good. Little bounces. Bounces.

440
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,692
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.

441
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,949
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.

442
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,377
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.

443
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,454
Put your hands onto your ribs.

444
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,670
Deeper. Good.

445
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,798
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.

446
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,255
Isn't that what
public speakings all about?

447
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:00,845
My wife and I are glad
to visit this important...

448
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,807
Take a good deep breath,
and up comes Your Royal Highness.

449
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,235
And slowly exhale,
and down comes Your Royal Highness.

450
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,529
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.

451
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,151
It's actually quite good fun.

452
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,949
Mmm... Mother.

453
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,651
Shorten
the humming each time.

454
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,908
Mother. Mmm...

455
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:22,412
- ...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.

456
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,084
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.

457
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,003
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.

458
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,751
Now, just sway.

459
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,250
Perfect.

460
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,132
- ...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.

461
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,589
Ding dong bell,
pussy's in the well.

462
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,347
Who put her in? Little Tommy Tin.

463
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,224
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.

464
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,279
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.

465
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,446
A... a king...

466
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,990
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open
window can learn to deliver a speech.

467
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,204
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good. Deep breath, and...

468
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,459
It is...

469
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,291
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.

470
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,298
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.

471
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,630
A sieve of thisted siphles.

472
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,559
Gah! Mah! Bah!

473
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,604
Father.

474
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,939
- Father.
- Father.

475
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,740
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.

476
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,194
- Father.
- Father.

477
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,405
Father. Father.

478
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,193
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.

479
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,025
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.

480
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,487
You been waiting long?

481
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,540
Christ, bloody freezing.

482
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,706
Where have you been?

483
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,631
- I've been busy.
- So have I.

484
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,260
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

485
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,555
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.

486
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,430
I'll drive.

487
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,019
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

488
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:56,194
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.

489
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,113
To... To complicate matters with Wallis.

490
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,985
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.

491
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,323
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever
about these things.

492
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,835
Whereas my letters patent
under the Great Seal

493
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,666
bearing date of Westminster
the 11th day of June 1912,

494
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,423
His Majesty King George the Fifth
did constitute order

495
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,219
and declare that there
should be a Guardian...

496
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,844
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...

497
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,769
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...

498
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,767
it's the Order
of the Council of State, sir.

499
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:36,067
So that we may act on your behalf...

500
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,110
...much clearer to me, I'm afraid...

501
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,739
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.

502
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,444
Thank you.

503
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,840
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...

504
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,051
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

505
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,683
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.

506
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,063
I feel dreadful. Ah...

507
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,737
Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?

508
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,565
No. No, George.

509
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,294
Yes. Yes, all right, of course.

510
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,217
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk

511
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,263
is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy.

512
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,263
Nor making our own drowsies either,
as we've had to do too often lately.

513
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,186
- David. Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.

514
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,980
It's Bertie.

515
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,435
No. No, it's not important.

516
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,067
I don't want to.

517
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,401
No. Telephone me later?

518
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,702
All right, goodbye.

519
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,493
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.

520
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,965
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks
are all half an hour fast.

521
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,567
How's the King?
I... I hope he's not in pain.

522
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,444
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.

523
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,156
Thank you.

524
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,623
David, if your father were here,
tardiness would not be tolerated.

525
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,670
None of this unpleasantness
would be tolerated.

526
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,343
You know, sir, I appreciate
that you are different from your father,

527
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,394
both in outlook and... temperament.

528
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:20,975
I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,

529
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,856
I tried, in your interest,

530
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:27,064
to present it
in the most favorable light.

531
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,652
Mmm. I can always trust you
to have my best interests at heart.

532
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,712
I fear our vigil will not be
of long duration. Please continue.

533
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,279
Let us commend our brother George
to the mercy of God,

534
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,948
our Maker and Redeemer.

535
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,291
Long live the King.

536
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,563
I hope I will make good
as he has made good.

537
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,097
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.

538
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,183
Now, I'm trapped.

539
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,072
And in these last 25
crowded, troubled, glorious years,

540
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,955
if there is one thing
that King George has taught,

541
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,914
it is the art of the leader who
is also e brother to his followers.

542
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,586
As long as he lived, he was
the guiding star of a great nation.

543
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,262
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

544
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,681
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?

545
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,804
...the little children
cried in the streets.

546
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,386
- You sure?
- Go on.

547
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,322
Put your thinking caps on.

548
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:21,033
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. it's always Othello.

549
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,792
Art thou afeard?

550
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,252
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.

551
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:40,427
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.

552
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,055
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

553
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,764
The isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs

554
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,099
that give delight, and hurt not.

555
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:53,186
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

556
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,365
and sometimes voices, that,
if then I had waked after long sleep,

557
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,161
will make me sleep again. All right,
clever clogs, so what comes next?

558
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,205
And then, in dreaming,
methought the clouds would...

559
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,954
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open,

560
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,206
and show riches ready to drop upon me,

561
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,583
that when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

562
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,164
That's such a sad thought.

563
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,591
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.

564
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,552
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

565
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,470
Bertie?

566
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,350
They told me not to expect you.

567
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,608
I'm sorry about your father.

568
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,451
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all. Please, come in. Come in.

569
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,419
I've been practicing. An hour a day.

570
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,592
In spite of everything.

571
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,543
What's going on there?

572
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,723
Oh, I was... Sorry.

573
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,017
Mucking around with my kids.

574
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,606
Do you feel like working today?

575
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,401
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.

576
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,232
Logue.Logue.

577
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,034
I'd kill for something stronger.

578
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,413
I wasn't there
for my father's death.

579
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:35,668
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.

580
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,752
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.

581
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,803
At least there was free beer.

582
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,549
Here's to the memory of your father.

583
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,941
I was informed, after the fact,

584
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,609
that my father's...

585
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,733
My father's last words were...

586
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:06,991
..."Bertie has more guts than the
rest of his brothers put together."

587
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,038
Couldn't say that to my face.

588
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,169
My brother.

589
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,960
What about him?

590
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,173
Try singing it.

591
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,722
- I'm sorry?
- What songs do you know?

592
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,645
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.

593
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,598
- Swanee Riven
- I love that song.

594
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,230
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.

595
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,403
No. Certainly not.

596
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,450
You know...
I always wanted to build models.

597
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,284
But... Father wouldn't allow it.

598
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:57,041
He... collected stamps,
so we had to collect stamps.

599
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,082

00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,020
"B-B-B-Bertie."

631
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,486
Father encouraged it.

632
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,820
Said, "Get it out, boy!"
Said it would make me stop.

633
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,998
He said, "l was afraid of my father

634
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:44,000
and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"

635
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,797
Are you naturally right-handed?

636
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,841
Left.

637
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,471
I was... punished,
and now I use the right.

638
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,769
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

639
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:08,311
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.

640
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:12,695
Metal splints were made.

641
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,777
Worn... worn day and night.

642
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,536
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.

643
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,958
Straight legs now.

644
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,083
Who were you closest to in your family?

645
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,377
Nannies.

646
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,709
Not my first nanny. She...

647
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:35,638
She loved David. Hated me.

648
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,181
When we were...

649
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,725
...presented to my parents
for the daily viewing,

650
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:45,773
she would... she'd pinch me

651
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:50,445
so that I'd cry and be handed back
to her immediately.

652
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,153
And then she would...

653
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,822
Sing it.

654
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:05,000
♪ Then she wouldn't feed me

655
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,205
Far, far away ♪

656
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:16,380
Took my parents...
three years to notice.

657
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:22,185
As you... as you can imagine,
caused some stomach problems.

658
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,770
Still.

659
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,735
What about your brother, Johnnie?

660
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,447
Were you close to him?

661
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:39,868
Johnnie... sweet boy.

662
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,951
Had...

663
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,208
...epilepsy.

664
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:56,051
And he was... different.

665
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,344
He died at... 13.

666
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,431
Hidden from view.

667
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:12,268
I'm... I'm told it's not... catching.

668
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,065
Do you want a top-up?

669
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,942
Please.

670
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,282
You know...

671
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,118
...Lionel, you're...

672
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,078
...you're the first
ordinary Englishman...

673
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,758
- Australian.
- ...I've ever really spoken to.

674
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,846
When I'm... driven through the streets

675
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,802
and I see the, you know,
the common man staring at me, I...

676
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,597
...I'm struck by how little
I know of his life

677
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,650
and how little he knows of mine.

678
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,149
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?

679
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,191
I wouldn't know.

680
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,203
I sifted seven...

681
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:13,580
...thick-stalked thistles
through a strong, thick sieve.

682
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:17,257
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.

683
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:21,007
Listen, I have to keep doing this,
it's awful. I sifted seven...

684
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,430
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...

685
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:30,688
One-hundred-year-old spruces
removed to improve the view?

686
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,730
Who does she think she is?

687
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,231
Nonetheless, we must try
to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.

688
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,655
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.

689
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,153
I'm getting plump.

690
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,785
Well, you seldom cook.

691
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,203
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.

692
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:53,752
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...

693
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,675
Three, two, one and...

694
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,253
Their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York.

695
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:06,307
Oh, how lovely to see you both.

696
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,183
Welcome to our little country shack.

697
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,523
I came at the invitation of the King.

698
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,862
Your Majesty.

699
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,612
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.

700
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,787
Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.

701
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,959
Very nice.

702
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,589
Hello, David. Making some...

703
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,133
...changes to the garden, I see.

704
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,965
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.

705
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,438
Don't tell me I behaved badly,
Mr. Churchill.

706
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,891
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.

707
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,228
Etiquette decrees that royalty
should be greeted by the official host,

708
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,109
in this case, the King. Not a commoner.

709
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,407
Thank you.

710
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:11,409
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.

711
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:17,161
Apparently, she has certain skills

712
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,794
acquired in an establishment
in Shanghai.

713
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,385
David.

714
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,423
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?

715
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:44,442
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.

716
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,024
- Doing what?
- Kinging.

717
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,783
Really? Kinging is a...

718
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,741
...a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?

719
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,544
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.

720
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:03,795
Ls kinging laying off 80... staff
and buying more pearls for Wallis,

721
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,627
while people are marching across Europe
singing The Red Flag?

722
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,554
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?

723
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,303
Where's the bloody 23?

724
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,225
And you put that woman
in our mother's suite!

725
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,430
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.

726
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,891
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.

727
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,523
I don't care what woman
you carry on with at night,

728
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,401
as long as you... show up
for duty in the morning.

729
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,609
Wallis is not just some woman
I'm carrying on with.

730
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,443
We intend to marry.

731
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:37,241
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.

732
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,951
Good God.

733
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,338
Can't you just give her
a nice house and a title?

734
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,292
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

735
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,504
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?

736
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,806
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.

737
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,434
Your beloved common man
may marry for love. Why not me?

738
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,229
If you were... a common man,

739
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,433
on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?

740
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,143
Sounds like you've
studied our wretched Constitution.

741
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,820
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.

742
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,525
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.

743
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,487
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...

744
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,955
Yearning for a larger audience,
are we, B-B-Bertie?

745
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,002
Don't. ..

746
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,049
What's that?

747
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,969
I'm sorry, I...

748
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,514
Younger brother trying to push
older brother off the throne.

749
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,887
P-P-Positively mediaeval.

750
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,974
Wallis.

751
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,478
Ah. Where have you been all this time?

752
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,310
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.

753
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:53,367
What a very complicated
little King you are.

754
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,660
I try to be.

755
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,911
All that work... down the drain.

756
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,709
My own brother.

757
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,129
I couldn't say a single word
to him in reply.

758
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,333
Why do you stammer so much more
with David than you ever do with me?

759
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,635
Because you're bloody well
paid to listen.

760
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,681
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.

761
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,100
What is it about David
that stops you speaking?

762
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,100
What is it about you that bloody
well makes you want to go on about him

763
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,023
-the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.

764
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,851
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!

765
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,814
- ls that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody...

766
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,367
...bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

767
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,821
Oh, a public school prig
could do better than that.

768
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,538
Shit.

769
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,407
Shit, Shit, Shit.

770
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,710
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!

771
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,665
Yes, defecation flows
trippingly from the tongue.

772
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,796
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?

773
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:57,514
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.

774
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,183
Fuck. Fuck!

775
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,387
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!

776
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,518
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!

777
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,894
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!

778
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,647
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see? Not a hesitation.

779
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,400
Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.

780
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,200
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.

781
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,776
Just finish your homework.

782
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,572
Well, that's a side of you
we don't get to see all that often.

783
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,452
No.

784
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,785
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.

785
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,965
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

786
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:37,763
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

787
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,592
Logue, you have no idea.

788
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,770
My... my brother

789
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,189
is infatuated with a...

790
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,767
...woman who's been married twice.

791
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,945
She's asking for a divorce,
and he's determined to marry her.

792
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,571
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson

793
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,620
- of Baltimore.
- That's not right.

794
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,949
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.

795
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,786
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.

796
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,998
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.

797
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,711
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.

798
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,847
Where does this leave you?

799
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,427
I know my place. I...

800
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,810
I... I will do anything...

801
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,812
...in my power to keep
my brother on the throne.

802
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,857
Is it that serious?

803
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:40,234
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.

804
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,070
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!

805
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,661
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.

806
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,617
- You could do it.
- That is treason.

807
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,668
I'm trying to get you to realize
you needn't be governed by fear.

808
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,496
I've had enough of this.

809
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,045
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!

810
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,843
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker

811
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,841
who wants elocution lessons
so you can chitchat...

812
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,220
Don't attempt to instruct me
on my duties!

813
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,475
I am the son of a... King.

814
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,306
And the brother of... of a King.

815
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,643
You're the disappointing son
of a brewer.

816
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,026
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.

817
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,234
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.

818
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,898
Through here, sir.

819
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:09,202
It's not because she's an
American. That is the least of it.

820
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,252
It's because she's a soon
to be twice divorced American.

821
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:18,503
And the King,
as head of the Church of England,

822
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,006
cannot marry a divorced woman.

823
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,006
And, sir, I apologize
for the nature of this.

824
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,678
According to Scotland Yard,

825
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,857
the King has not always
possessed exclusive rights

826
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:41,029
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections...

827
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,279
...sharing them with a
married used car salesman,

828
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,282
a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.

829
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,375
In addition, it is also
rumored Hitler's ambassador,

830
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:59,127
Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.

831
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,469
Should His Majesty continue to ignore
the advice of his government,

832
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,296
he must abdicate.

833
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,849
Otherwise, his government
has no choice but to resign.

834
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,019
Prime Minister,
you'd leave a country without a...

835
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,389
...a government?

836
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,565
Does the King do what he wants?

837
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,736
Or does he do what
the people expect him to do?

838
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,408
As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go,

839
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,909
can a king separate his personal life

840
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,456
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?

841
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,330
I'm just having trouble with a patient.

842
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,338
That isn't like you.

843
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,302
- Why?
- He's scared.

844
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,138
He's afraid of his own shadow.

845
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,098
Isn't that why they come to you?

846
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,187
This fellow could
really be somebody great.

847
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,640
He's fighting me.

848
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,272
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.

849
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,364
Perhaps that's what you want.

850
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,821
I might have overstepped the mark.

851
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,784
Apologize. Do you both good.

852
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,349
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue,
the Duke is busy.

853
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,678
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.

854
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,265
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

855
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,484
Thank you.

856
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,823
Thank you.

857
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,670
Parliament will not support
the marriage.

858
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,089
But there are other reasons for concern.

859
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,516
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve,

860
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,220
and there are those who are
worried about where he will stand

861
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,681
when war comes with Germany.

862
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,778
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.

863
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:32,030
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

864
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,782
War with Germany will come.

865
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:39,207
And we will need a King
whom we can all stand behind, united.

866
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,001
I fear my...

867
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,459
...brother is not of sound mind...

868
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,421
...at this time.

869
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:52,379
Have you thought
what you will call yourself? Hmm?

870
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:04,062
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.

871
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:13,901
What about George?
After your father?

872
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:19,824
George the Sixth
has a rather nice continuity to it.

873
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:20,998
Don't you think?

874
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,831
David. Thank God.

875
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,292
You look exhausted.

876
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,587
How are you bearing up?

877
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,174
Bertie, the decision's been made. I...

878
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,930
I'm going.

879
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,768
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.

880
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,480
I must marry her.

881
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,111
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

882
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,454
That's a terrible thing to hear.

883
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,284
Nobody wants that.

884
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,794
I, least of all.

885
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,878
At long last,

886
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,682
I am able to say a few words of my own.

887
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,679
I have never wanted
to withhold anything,

888
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,015
but until now it has not been
constitutionally possible

889
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,395
for me to speak.

890
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:33,688
A few hours ago,
I discharged my last duty

891
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,571
as King and Emperor,

892
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:42,076
and now that I have been succeeded
by my brothel;

893
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,998
the Duke of York,

894
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,919
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.

895
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,749
This I do with all my heart.

896
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:59,340
You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne,

897
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,347
but you must believe me when I tell you

898
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,600
that I have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burden

899
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:10,809
of responsibility
and to discharge my duties as King,

900
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:13,270
as I would wish to do

901
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:18,199
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

902
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,110
And I want you to know,

903
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:26,121
this decision has been
made less difficult to me

904
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,043
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

905
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,292
with his long training
in the public affairs of this country,

906
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,467
and with his fine qualities,

907
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,216
will be able to take my place forthwith

908
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,892
without interruption or injury

909
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,891
to the life and progress of the Empire.

910
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,132
I meet you today...

911
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,803
...in...

912
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,900
...in circumstances which are...

913
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,915
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.

914
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,996
Thank you, darling.
Saddles. Margaret.

915
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,424
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.

916
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:44,345
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you. Oops.

917
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,549
- Don't worry, Sally. We'll get you...
- Mama?

918
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,384
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses

919
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,935
- in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.

920
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,478
We'll have a palace of rooms.

921
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,236
Curtsey.

922
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,701
Your Majesty.

923
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,170
How was it?

924
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:42,354
I was trying to...
familiarize myself

925
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,066
with... what a state paper looks like.

926
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,534
It's a...

927
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:55,078
...dispatch from Mr. Baldwin,
which I don't understand a word of.

928
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,162
David's finances.

929
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:08,722
Christmas... broadcast.

930
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,100
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.

931
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,052
Oh.

932
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,154
Plans for the Coronation.

933
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,109
Think that would be
an even bigger mistake.

934
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,993
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.

935
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,338
I'm a Naval officer. That's all I know.

936
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,586
I'm not a King. I'm not a King.

937
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,880
- I'm sorry.
- No.

938
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,807
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly. Please.

939
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,638
Oh, my dear.

940
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,270
My dear, dear man.

941
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,854
- I'm sorry.
- You know,

942
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,736
I refused your first
two marriage proposals,

943
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,409
not because I didn't love you,

944
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,580
but because I couldn't bear
the idea of a Royal life.

945
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:20,376
Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours, public duty, of...

946
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:24,672
Well, a life that no longer
was really to be my own.

947
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:31,088
But then I thought, he stammers
so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.

948
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:02,460
Waiting for a King to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.

949
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,417
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

950
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,133
This is home.

951
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,137
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.

952
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,641
It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.

953
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,269
- Oh! May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

954
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,617
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.

955
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,912
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?

956
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,282
Here's your shilling.

957
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,628


958
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,174
I understand...

959
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,428
...what you were trying to say, Logue.

960
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,434
I went about it the wrong way.

961
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,804
I'm sorry.

962
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,353
So, here I am.

963
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:12,155
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?

964
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,824
Every stammerer always fears
going back to square one.

965
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,698
I don't let that happen.

966
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,155
If I fail in my duty,

967
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,835
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.

968
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:30,211
"God save our... King."

969
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,087
They don't mean me.

970
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,888
Every monarch in history

971
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,637
has succeeded someone who's dead

972
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,435
or just about to be.

973
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:51,152
My predecessor is not only alive,
but very much so.

974
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,903
It's a bloody mess.

975
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,486
Couldn't even give them
a Christmas speech.

976
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,573
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.

977
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,284
He's not here anymore.

978
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,421
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.

979
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,627
Easy enough to give away.

980
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,758
You don't have to carry him
around in your pocket.

981
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,339
Or your brother.

982
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,177
You don't need to be afraid
of the things you were afraid of

983
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,763
when you were five.

984
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,774
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

985
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,865
Am I?

986
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,864
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!

987
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:46,949
Myrtle.

988
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,582
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.

989
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,214
Bertie. Come here.

990
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,214
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.

991
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,469
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.

992
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,641
- What is it?
- Oh!

993
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,223
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.

994
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,650
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."

995
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,398
Not "malm" as in "palm."

996
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,981
I haven't told her about us.

997
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,861
Sit down, relax.

998
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:24,446
I'm told your husband
calls my husband Bertie.

999
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,872
And my husband calls
your husband Lionel.

1000
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,449
I trust you won't call me Liz.

1001
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,462
Your Majesty, you may
call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.

1002
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,414
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.

1003
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,044
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.

1004
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,300
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.

1005
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,223
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.

1006
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,139
Get out there, man.

1007
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,894
Hello, Myrtle, darling.

1008
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,025
You're early.

1009
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,150
I believe you two have met,
but I don't think you know...

1010
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,993
- ...King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1011
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,079
Will Their Majesties
be staying to dinner?

1012
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:16,209
We'd love to, such a treat,
but alas a...

1013
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,041
...previous engagement. What a pity.

1014
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,769
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.

1015
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,689
What a glorious transformation, sir.

1016
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:45,151
I hope you'll forgive us
if we continue our preparations?

1017
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:51,954
Now, allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.

1018
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:01,258
We begin, of course,
at the West door into the nave.

1019
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:06,759
I see all your pronouncements
are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1020
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,308
Ah, yes. Wireless.

1021
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,761
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,

1022
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,065
and I'm afraid I've also had
to permit the newsreel cameras.

1023
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,770
The product of which
I shall personally edit.

1024
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,355
Without momentary hesitations.

1025
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:26,159
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.

1026
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:30,033
He's... my speech therapist.

1027
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,871
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty

1028
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,953
was seeking assistance, I should
have made my own recommendation.

1029
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,458
Dr. Logue will...

1030
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,424
...will be attending the Coronation.

1031
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:47,300
Of course I'll speak to the Dean,
but it will be extremely difficult.

1032
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,222
I should like the...

1033
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:54,352
...doctor to be seated in the...

1034
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,645
...King's Box.

1035
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,733
But members of your family
will be seated there, sir.

1036
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,606
That is why it is suitable.

1037
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,856
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,
we need the premises.

1038
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,488
My dear fellow,
this is Westminster Abbey.

1039
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,615
The Church must prepare His Majesty.

1040
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,618
My preparations are equally
as important.

1041
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,587
With complete privacy,
if you don't mind.

1042
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,584
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1043
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:29,797
I will place the Abbey
at Your Majesty's disposal,

1044
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,430
this evening. Your Majesty.

1045
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,927
I can't believe I'm walking
on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1046
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,515
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.

1047
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,396
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.

1048
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,980
Call me Lionel.

1049
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:29,153
True, you... never...

1050
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:32,576
...called yourself Doctor. I did that...

1051
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,113
...for you.

1052
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,909
No training.

1053
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,837
No diploma, no...

1054
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,383
...qualifications

1055
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:52,304
Just... a great deal of nerve.

1056
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,716
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?

1057
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,722
You asked for trust.

1058
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:02,272
And... total equality.

1059
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:05,772
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.

1060
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,526
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?"

1061
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:13,075
- What, as a failed actor?
- it's true.

1062
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:18,828
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.

1063
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,369
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.

1064
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,045
When the Great War came,

1065
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,669
all our soldiers were returning
to Australia from the front,

1066
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:31,378
a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak.

1067
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,883
Somebody said, Lionel,
"You're very good at this speech stuff.

1068
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,636
Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers?"

1069
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,435
I did muscle therapy,
exercises, relaxation,

1070
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,763
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1071
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,771
Those poor young blokes
had cried out in fear.

1072
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,103
No one was listening to them.

1073
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,741
My job was to give them faith
in their own voice,

1074
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,445
and let them know that
a friend was listening.

1075
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,874
That must ring
a few bells with you, Bertie.

1076
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,463
You give a very noble
account of yourself.

1077
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:12,509
- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.

1078
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:16,339
You have no idea who I have
breathing down my neck.

1079
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,100
I vouched for you, and you have no...

1080
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,601
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.

1081
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,026
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.

1082
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,944
Everything I know,
I know from experience.

1083
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,649
And that war was some experience.

1084
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,362
My plaque says,
"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1085
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,448
Not "Doctor."
There are no letters after my name.

1086
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,872
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.

1087
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,628
- On what charge?
- Fraud.

1088
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:55,382
With war looming, you've saddled
this nation with a voiceless...

1089
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,715
...King. You've destroyed
the happiness of my family,

1090
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:05,020
all for the sake of ensnaring
a star... patient you couldn't...

1091
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,598
...possibly hope to assist.

1092
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,642
It'll be like mad...

1093
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,567
...King George the Third.

1094
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,989
I'll be... Mad King...

1095
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,279
...George the Stammerer...

1096
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,831
...who let his people down
so badly in their hour of need.

1097
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,421
What are you doing? Get up!
You can't sit there! Get up!

1098
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,420
- Why not? it's a chair.
- No, it... That is not a chair!

1099
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,501
That is... That...

1100
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,260
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.

1101
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,931
That chair is the seat
on which every King...

1102
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:45,557
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!

1103
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,266
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes

1104
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,350
- have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

1105
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,732
- Listen to you? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.

1106
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,937
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.

1107
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,319
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.

1108
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,695
Why should I waste my time
listening to you?

1109
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,904
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!

1110
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,868
Yes, you do.

1111
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,474
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.

1112
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,846
You'll make a bloody good King.

1113
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:37,404
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1114
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,152
Mr. Logue, you must know that

1115
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:43,031
I've found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable credentials.

1116
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,659
Hence, your services
will no longer be required.

1117
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,706
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function

1118
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,752
is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,

1119
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:57,129
- but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.

1120
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:03,135
In this personal matter,
I will make my own decision.

1121
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:07,972
My concern is for the head
on which I must place the crown.

1122
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:10,179
I appreciate that, Archbishop.

1123
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,773
But it's my head.

1124
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,984
Your humble servant.

1125
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,785
Thank you, Bertie.

1126
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,624
Shall we rehearse? Come on.
Up on your perch.

1127
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,214
Now, when you and Elizabeth
enter through the West door,

1128
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:46,424
you will be greeted by the hymn
"I was glad when they said unto me."

1129
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:49,806
Actually, you won't be that glad because
they do sing it for a very long time.

1130
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:56,691
Then your friend, the Archbishop,
will ponce up the stairs towards you,

1131
01:29:56,766 --> 01:30:02,068
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take the oath?"

1132
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,651
- "l am willing."
- Well, of course you are.

1133
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,907
I'm gonna see what this sounds like
in the cheap seats,

1134
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,409
so even your old nanny can hear.

1135
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:15,244
"Will you govern your peoples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1136
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:18,251
Australia and New Zealand,

1137
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:22,301
according to their lands and customs?"

1138
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,719
- "l solemnly promise to do so."
- Louder.

1139
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:28,594
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."

1140
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,768
Very good. "And will you, to your power,

1141
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:36,940
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be
executed in all your judgments?"

1142
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,892
"I will. I will!"

1143
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,024
Then there's a very long bit
about upholding the faith. It goes on,

1144
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,856
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,
to which you finally say...

1145
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:50,868
"The things which I have...
here before promised,

1146
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,746
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."

1147
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:58,204
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.

1148
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,711
Kiss the book, sign the oath,
and you're King.

1149
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,458
Easy.

1150
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,729
You nearly crowned him backwards,
Archbishop.

1151
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:25,322
Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown, sir.

1152
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,650
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.

1153
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:31,240
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1154
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:37,042
- God save the King.
- Very good.

1155
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,293
Very good, Archbishop.

1156
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,790
Well, I hope Your Majesties
are thrilled with the result.

1157
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:49,004
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait. Keep going.

1158
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,465
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.

1159
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,767
Masses of uniformed men,
stupefying to the eye,

1160
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:57,346
and incredible to the imagination
have stood in spellbound audience

1161
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,978
of the Fuhrer.

1162
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:14,033
- Papa? Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?

1163
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:18,288
I don't know, but he seems
to be saying it rather well.

1164
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:42,608
Sir... I have asked to see you today

1165
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,812
in order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.

1166
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:51,616
I'm so sorry to hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.

1167
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:55,366
Neville Chamberlain will
take my place as Prime Minister.

1168
01:32:55,445 --> 01:33:00,042
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.

1169
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,666
I have found it impossible to believe

1170
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,090
that there is any man in the world

1171
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:12,262
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1172
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:16,888
that the world may be hurled
for a second time

1173
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,266
into the abyss of destructive war.

1174
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,690
Churchill was right all along.

1175
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,315
This was always Hitler's intention.

1176
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:33,192
I'm only very sorry to leave you
at this great time of crisis.

1177
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:41,826
I'm very much afraid, sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1178
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,424
I am speaking to you...

1179
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:54,630
...from the Cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street.

1180
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:58,967
This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin

1181
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,055
handed the German government
a final note

1182
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:08,816
stating that unless
we heard from them by 11:00,

1183
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:14,024
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1184
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:17,452
a state of war would exist between us.

1185
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:25,165
I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received,

1186
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:30,795
and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.

1187
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,890
At last, sir, here is your speech.

1188
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,976
You are on air at six.

1189
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:46,602
I have timed it
to just under nine minutes.

1190
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,309
The wording is fully approved.

1191
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:52,111
The Prime Minister
will be joining you for the broadcast,

1192
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,906
which will go outlive
across the nation, the Empire

1193
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:58,326
- and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.

1194
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:15,627
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.

1195
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:20,052
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.

1196
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,363
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no. Go straight there.

1197
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:36,860
We'll be all right.

1198
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,452
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.

1199
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,708
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.

1200
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,681
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.

1201
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,514
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.

1202
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,441
We have about 40 minutes
to the broadcast.

1203
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,856
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1204
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:21,694
There may be dark days ahead...

1205
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,492
- ...and...
- Try again.

1206
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:33,668
There may be dark days ahead, and...

1207
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,293
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself, "God save the King."

1208
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:42,051
I say that continuously,
but apparently no one's listening.

1209
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,134
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.

1210
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:48,265
Then I'm the solemnest king
who ever lived.

1211
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,895
You know, if I'm a king,
where's my power?

1212
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,817
Can I... can I form a government?

1213
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,271
Can I... can I... levy a tax?

1214
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,823
Declare a... a war? No.

1215
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:04,118
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why? Because...

1216
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:07,994
...the nation believes
that when I... I speak,

1217
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,325
I speak for them. But I can't speak.

1218
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:15,039
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."

1219
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:31,313
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1244
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:25,632
-from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.

1245
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:29,301
Congrat... Congratulations.

1246
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,010
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.

1247
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:39,979
The long... walk.

1248
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,986
Good luck, sir.

1249
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:48,692
I, too, dread this apparatus.

1250
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,911
Had a speech impediment myself,
you know.

1251
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:56,833
- I didn't.
- Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1252
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,536
An operation was considered
to be too dangerous.

1253
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:03,340
I eventually made an asset of it.

1254
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,969
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.

1255
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,513
Darling.

1256
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:13,762
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.

1257
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:46,666
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

1258
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,087
Mr. Wood.

1259
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:55,550
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.

1260
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:00,555
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.

1261
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,895
I'm a thistle-sifter.

1262
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:10,073
I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1263
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,777
A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1264
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:15,987
- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.

1265
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,198
Make sure it's not switched on.

1266
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:20,158
Remember, the red light
will blink four times,

1267
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,993
then I've asked them to turn it off.

1268
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,125
'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

1269
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,507
One minute, sir.

1270
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,671
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

1271
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:46,275
Forty seconds, sir.

1272
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,779
Logue.

1273
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,859
However this turns out...

1274
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,659
...I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.

1275
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:03,125
Knighthood?

1276
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,253
Twenty seconds.

1277
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:19,308
Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.

1278
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:23,350
Say it to me as a friend.

1279
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:06,932
In this grave...

1280
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:09,896
..hour..

1281
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:21,788
...perhaps the most fateful
in our history...

1282
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:26,493
...I send...

1283
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:29,124
...to every household of my...

1284
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:33,757
...a-peoples...

1285
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,212
...both at home...

1286
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:44,431
...and overseas...

1287
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,984
...this message...

1288
01:43:56,981 --> 01:44:01,703
...spoken with the same
depth of feeling...

1289
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,488
...for each one of you...

1290
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:10,086
...as if I were able
to cross your threshold

1291
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:14,382
and speak to you... myself.

1292
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:22,803
For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1293
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:25,431
...we are... at...

1294
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,852
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1295
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,179
...at war.

1296
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,606
Very good.

1297
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:36,438
Over and over again...

1298
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,900
...we have tried to find...

1299
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:48,708
...a peaceful way out
of the differences...

1300
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,370
...between ourselves...

1301
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,000
...and those...

1302
01:44:54,705 --> 01:45:00,053
...who are now our... enemies.

1303
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:06,051
But it has been... in vain.

1304
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:11,936
We have been forced into a conflict,

1305
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:16,941
for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,

1306
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:21,240
which, if it were to prevail,

1307
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:25,866
would be fatal to any civilized order

1308
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,993
in the world.

1309
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:31,580
Such a principle,

1310
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:37,587
stripped of all disguise,

1311
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:40,794
is surely the mere...

1312
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:47,892
...primitive doctrine that might...

1313
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,019
...is right.

1314
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:57,819
For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dean

1315
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,488
it is unthinkable

1316
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:06,240
that we should refuse to meet...

1317
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:07,991
...the challenge.

1318
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:15,287
It is to this high purpose

1319
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,043
that I now call

1320
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:22,093
my people at home,

1321
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:26,673
and my peoples across the seas,

1322
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:31,511
who will make our cause their own.

1323
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:36,600
I ask them to stand calm

1324
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:39,856
and firm and united

1325
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:43,985
in this time of trial.

1326
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,817
The task will be hard.

1327
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:51,747
There may be dark days ahead,

1328
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:57,670
and war can no longer be confined

1329
01:46:57,745 --> 01:47:00,043
to the battlefield.

1330
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:03,126
But we can only do the right

1331
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,802
as we see the right,

1332
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:09,849
and reverently commit

1333
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:14,395
our cause to God.

1334
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,938
If one and all we keep

1335
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:24,944
resolutely faithful to it,

1336
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:30,950
then, with God's help,

1337
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:34,908
we shall... prevail.

1338
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,632
It was very good, Bertie.

1339
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,233
You still stammered on the

1340
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:14,075
Well, I had to throw in a few,
so they knew it was me.

1341
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:21,962
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.

1342
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,755
Thank you, Mr. Wood.

1343
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,136
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.

1344
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:33,091
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

1345
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:44,811
Ready.

1346
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:48,109
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.

1347
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:52,573
Your first wartime speech.

1348
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:54,528
Congratulations.

1349
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:59,708
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.

1350
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:04,789
Thank you, Logue.

1351
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:15,675
Well done.

1352
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,640
My friend.

1353
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:22,056
Thank you...

1354
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,312
...Your Majesty.

1355
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,535
I knew you'd be good.

1356
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,918
Thank you... Lionel.

1357
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:55,430
Onwards.

1358
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:59,560
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.

1359
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,603
Couldn't have
said it better myself, sir.

1360
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:04,682
Your Majesty, I am speechless.

1361
01:50:04,765 --> 01:50:08,144
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1362
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:14,860
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,

1363
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:19,698
- but you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.

1364
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:24,293
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.

1365
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,791
Of course I was.

1366
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,965
Are we all ready?

1367
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,542
Come on, girls.

1367
01:51:30,040 --> 01:52:00,542
