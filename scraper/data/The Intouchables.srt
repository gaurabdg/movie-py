1
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,191
Outta the way!

2
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,627
Here they come.

3
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:13,672
Philippe, 100 euros
says I can lose them.

4
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,633
- Philippe.
- You're on.

5
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,301
Here we go.

6
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,584
You're in shape. God!

7
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,672
Shit!

8
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,307
Fuck!

9
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,467
So you lost them?

10
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,183
Get out! Hands on the hood!

11
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,895
- Get out!
- Two hundred says I get an escort.

12
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,684
You'll lose again.

13
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:09,398
- Two hundred, an escort!
- You're on.

14
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:11,108
Let's see your hands!

15
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:12,818
Your goddamn hands!

16
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,942
Let me explain.

17
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,157
Shut your mouth
and put your hands on the hood!

18
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,320
Hold on.

19
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,662
- Let go!
- I said get out!

20
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,327
He can't get out!

21
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,961
He can't even open the door!

22
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,213
- What?
- Look at the sticker!

23
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,841
There's a wheelchair in the trunk!

24
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,377
Go and check!

25
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:34,965
T ake a look.

26
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,596
Let go of me.

27
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,095
Yeah.

28
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,806
Well?

29
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,345
What is this?

30
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,481
You think I drive that fast
for the hell of it?

31
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,482
We're heading for the hospital.

32
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,609
He's having a fit, OK.

33
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,065
It's an emergency!

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,231
He can't move! I'm his caregiver.

35
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,945
We have a problem.

36
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,818
Look.

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,822
What do we do?

38
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,413
Know what? Think it over.
T ake your time.

39
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:08,954
Then call his kid and say
you killed her dad!

40
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,418
In five minutes, he'll be a goner,

41
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,129
dead as a dodo.

42
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,509
So take your time.

43
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:19,555
Go on, think it over!
While he croaks.

44
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:21,883
OK, get going.

45
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:38,316
- Where are you heading?
- The ER.

46
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,451
We'll escort you, it's safer.

47
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,954
We're escorting them. Let's go!

48
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,247
It's OK, they're splitting.

49
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,580
This is really gross, Philippe.

50
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,000
Freaks me out.
How do you produce this stuff?

51
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:58,420
Maybe you should take
that driving test now.

52
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, but for now,
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

53
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,474
An escort at 200 euros.

54
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,931
I never wager such large sums.

55
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,521
This calls for a change of mood.

56
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,349
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

57
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,645
Come on, I helped you out.

58
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,568
Philippe, the escort.

59
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,158
The escort, it's safer.

60
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,492
We'll escort you, it's safer!

61
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,670
Here he comes.

62
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:04,379
They're bringing a stretcher.
You'll be OK?

63
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,172
- Yes, fine.
- Good luck.

64
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,340
Goodbye.

65
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,899
What do we do now?

66
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,493
You let me handle it now.

67
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,765
Any references?

68
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,976
Yes, I have a DAHC,

69
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,101
a Diploma in Advanced Home Care.

70
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,364
I backed it up with training
at the Bayer Institute in 2001.

71
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,490
I studied social work at school,

72
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,074
then did a course
in social and family economics.

73
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,705
Actually, the thing is...

74
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:57,288
I've done more studying
than working.

75
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,002
What is your key motivation?

76
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,004
Money.

77
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:04,124
The man.

78
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,376
I'm totally into that.

79
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,135
That's nice.

80
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,342
Helping others, I think.

81
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,723
Is that OK? Did I get it right?

82
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:14,638
The neighborhood.

83
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,677
I like crippled people,

84
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,346
since I was little.

85
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:22,184
Working to make the handicapped
independent,

86
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,522
on a social level.

87
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,187
Sport too. You need to move.

88
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,985
To fit in with life.

89
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,526
These people can't do a thing.

90
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,321
I had
my first professional experience...

91
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,573
That was Mrs. Dupont-Moretti...

92
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,958
A very old lady...

93
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,036
...really very old...

94
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:46,675
...whom I cared for until the end.

95
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:49,711
There were fun times
in the geriatric unit

96
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,345
at Halloween and so on.

97
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm also an expert
with bureaucracy.

98
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:58,640
Housing grants, for instance.

99
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,396
I don't know. Maybe...

100
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:02,891
...you get one?

101
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,061
Check, Magalie,
but somehow I doubt it.

102
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,037
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

103
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,196
Enough.

104
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,949
- I'm Laprade.
- I'm sick of waiting.

105
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,206
Hello.

106
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,712
I need a signature.

107
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,836
Have a seat.

108
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:38,893
Any references?

109
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,021
- I have plenty.
- All right.

110
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,855
We're listening.

111
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,813
Kool and the Gang,
Earth, Wind & Fire.

112
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,527
Good references?

113
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,814
I don't know them. Sit down.

114
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,568
You know nothing about music.

115
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm no ignoramus
when it comes to music

116
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:59,868
even if I don't know Cruel...

117
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,033
- Kool and the Gang.
- And you?

118
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,793
Do you know Chopin,
Schubert or Berlioz?

119
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,045
Do I know Berlioz?

120
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,215
I bet you don't!

121
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,505
I'm a specialist.

122
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,668
Oh yeah?

123
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,088
Who do you know there?

124
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,756
Which building?

125
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,763
What do you mean?

126
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,553
Before becoming a housing project,

127
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:26,520
Berlioz was a 19th century composer,
writer and critic.

128
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:30,778
Bullshit. I know who Berlioz is.
Humor's like music for you.

129
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,072
You suck at both.

130
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,911
You need a signature?

131
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,998
Yeah, to say
I applied for the job...

132
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,293
...but that despite
my obvious qualities...

133
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:52,880
Just put the usual spiel
about not being interested.

134
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,712
I need three refusals
to get the benefit.

135
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,972
I see, your benefit.

136
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:59,678
Any other motivations?

137
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,841
Yes, plenty.

138
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:03,936
One right here.

139
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,972
Very motivating in fact.

140
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:11,026
OK, I'm having a blast,
but what do we do?

141
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,277
Sign or not?

142
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,730
I can't sign right now.

143
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,066
- Why not?
- Why not?

144
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,163
That's a bummer.

145
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,170
I'm already late handing it in.

146
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,922
That's a bummer as you say.

147
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:41,511
- Can't Ms. Motivation sign for you?
- Magalie isn't authorized.

148
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,727
T oo bad, she could have added
her cell number.

149
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,604
Pick it up tomorrow at nine.

150
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,235
I'd hate to deprive you
of your benefit.

151
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:54,778
I won't see you out.

152
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,564
No, don't get up.

153
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,199
I mean, stay seated.

154
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,573
I'll come back tomorrow.

155
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,161
Mina, is she here?

156
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,826
No, she'll be back late.

157
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,917
No!

158
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:01,755
Turn the tap off
or I don't have any water!

159
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,089
Turn the tap off!

160
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:04,882
Get out of here!

161
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,392
I'm taking a shower!

162
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:08,177
- Leave me be!
- Out!

163
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,145
Get them out.

164
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,305
Go on.

165
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,315
Bintou, I'm serious!

166
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,475
Mina!

167
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,352
Get them out!

168
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,236
Get out with your big belly.

169
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,738
Let go!

170
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:21,319
Get out!

171
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,654
Out, you lot!

172
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,113
Get it?

173
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,244
- Hey, Bintou.
- Let go!

174
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,076
Bintou, what the hell?

175
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,915
Sit down, you!

176
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,353
- Where were you?
- At school.

177
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,234
Where are you going?

178
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:58,815
Horse-riding.

179
00:14:58,989 --> 00:14:59,978
Wise guy.

180
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,027
Here, it's for you.

181
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,106
Where were you?

182
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,242
On vacation.

183
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,408
People talk around here.

184
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,489
You think I'm a dumb bitch?

185
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,541
Six months without seeing you.

186
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,577
Not one phone call.
Nothing!

187
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,372
And now you turn up
with a Kinder egg?

188
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:02,876
You think your scams
will pay for the rent,

189
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,133
for food?

190
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:10,136
You think this is a hotel?

191
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,435
Look at me when I talk to you!

192
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,022
Idiot!

193
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,975
There's no talking to you!

194
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,268
Want to talk?

195
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:26,656
I'm listening.

196
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,198
I'm listening.

197
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,086
You know, Driss,

198
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,588
I've done a lot of praying for you.

199
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,584
But, God forgive me,

200
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:45,968
I have other children.

201
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,717
I still have hope for them.

202
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,643
I don't want you coming back here.

203
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,436
Just pack up your bags
and get the hell out.

204
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,816
Is that clear?

205
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,860
Get out.

206
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:06,772
Get out!

207
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,397
That was a good one, right?

208
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:29,780
Know what? I'm going.

209
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,656
- It wasn't funny?
- Forget it.

210
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,363
It wasn't funny?

211
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,216
- Yes?
- It's for my paper.

212
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,343
- I was expecting you.
- About...

213
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,096
- Come in.
-...my benefit.

214
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,355
T ell Philippe he's here.

215
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:50,903
Right away.

216
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,359
Well?

217
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,075
No beetroot,
but the radishes are nearly ready.

218
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,204
Good.

219
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,364
Hello.

220
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:10,923
Come along.

221
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,381
I'm warning you, he had a bad night.

222
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,884
Like you apparently.

223
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:22,268
His day begins at 7:00 a.m.
with the nurse.

224
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:25,350
He needs two to three hours of care
each morning.

225
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,142
Many applicants throw in the towel
after a week.

226
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,730
We see a lot of them.

227
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,028
I like the decor,
the music and all the rest,

228
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,113
but I'm not buying
and I have stuff to do.

229
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:42,780
I was told to show you around.

230
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,414
Anyhow, it's nearly over.

231
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,831
T o communicate,
you have a baby monitor.

232
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,961
It's like a walkie-talkie.

233
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,424
Under the terms of the contract,
you have your own quarters.

234
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,176
This is the toilet.

235
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,849
And you have a separate bathroom.

236
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,221
This way.

237
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,155
He's expecting you.

238
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:26,449
Just a minute.

239
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,050
I had your paper signed.

240
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,465
It's on the table over there.

241
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:51,474
So you like being assisted?

242
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,354
What?

243
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,770
You don't mind
living off others' backs?

244
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,939
It's not a problem for you?

245
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,573
No. How about you?

246
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:08,037
Do you think you're capable of working?
With constraints, regular hours,

247
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,370
responsibilities...

248
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,206
A sense of humor after all.

249
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:15,046
And I'm ready to try you out
for a month.

250
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,499
You have a day to think it over.

251
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,511
I bet you won't last two weeks.

252
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,121
What?

253
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:53,536
No bone,

254
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:56,581
no muscle should be ignored.
Move them all.

255
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,841
Keep the skin and joints
in good condition.

256
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:04,255
T o do that,
you need to be meticulous,

257
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,675
and strict.
All right? Is that clear?

258
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,559
Wake up!

259
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,186
You sleep at night!

260
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,436
I'm not asleep.

261
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:13,643
Help me.

262
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,733
Let's put Philippe in his chair...

263
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,607
...and get him to the shower.

264
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,568
I know...

265
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:25,192
Try it on your own. Show me.

266
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,451
Don't be scared. Go on.

267
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,040
I'm not scared.

268
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:49,591
Happy now?

269
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,725
Never let him go
until he's strapped in.

270
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,606
Yes, I'm kinky that way.

271
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,608
No one told me.

272
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,525
I'm in training.

273
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:07,485
Do you want white gloves or what?
Scrub away!

274
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,530
The shampoo's weird,
it won't lather.

275
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:13,323
- How's it going?
- It won't lather.

276
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,162
What?

277
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,623
I don't believe it.

278
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,004
That's his foot cream.

279
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,631
Hold on.

280
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:24,877
Don't tell me you can't read, Driss!

281
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,215
Sure I can, but...

282
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,429
You seem pretty gifted.

283
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,512
Usually it's one for the whole body.

284
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:32,847
This guy has 20.

285
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,891
I'm not spending all day here.

286
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:37,181
This one then?

287
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,020
The one marked shampoo.

288
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,527
Will you manage?

289
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,279
Of course he will.

290
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,073
My feet are beautifully coiffed.

291
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,652
Go and have lunch, Marcelle.

292
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:53,659
Where's the skirt?

293
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:58,286
They're support stockings.
They help the blood to flow properly

294
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,669
so I don't faint.

295
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:04,963
I'm not doing that.

296
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,510
There's a problem here.

297
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,009
Seeing as how I won't be doing it,

298
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:13,550
we need to see if...
Marcelle!

299
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:17,438
Maybe Marcelle could come back
to put them on you.

300
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:21,566
She knows how to do it,
being a chick and all that...

301
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:24,069
I'm just not doing it, OK.

302
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,945
You're better off fainting.

303
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:27,697
I mean, sometimes...

304
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:30,693
We just refuse to put them on.
We're men.

305
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,077
No way, Marcelle!

306
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,589
You're good with stockings.

307
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,593
Only natural with that cute earring.

308
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,045
Can we cut the joking?

309
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,598
You're a natural at this.

310
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,010
Haven't you ever considered work...

311
00:25:57,314 --> 00:25:58,895
...as a beautician?

312
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,601
OK, that's done.

313
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,236
What are the gloves for?

314
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,741
Let's wait a while.
You're not quite ready for that yet.

315
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:13,239
No, he's not quite ready.

316
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,201
What do you mean,
not ready for what?

317
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,619
- What is this?
- We'll explain.

318
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:22,707
We need to talk, Marcelle!
This training's not working.

319
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,629
Ready or not,

320
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,758
I'm not emptying the ass
of a guy I don't know.

321
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:30,377
Or even of a guy I do know.

322
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,342
I don't empty anyone's ass,
on principle.

323
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,804
Can I finish eating first?

324
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:43,765
No.

325
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:46,268
Let's just leave it at this.

326
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,903
I don't go for this sick stuff.

327
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,032
The stockings were bad enough.

328
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:54,067
But I met you part way.

329
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,613
Your turn.
Drop the ass emptying.

330
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,156
- I get the message.
- It's wrong.

331
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,665
Just drop it.

332
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:01,996
Enjoy your lunch.

333
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:10,257
Beautiful, huh?

334
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,635
I love it.

335
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:18,680
Don't mind me.

336
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:22,396
You're not at the movies,
I'm eating here.

337
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,891
Hi. Where can I find a beer?

338
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,776
Maybe in your wig.

339
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,105
You took both packs?

340
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,568
No idea. I don't care.

341
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,357
Take your mop-head for a walk.

342
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,030
Let's go.

343
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,570
He's the guy my dad hired.

344
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,079
Oh, right.

345
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,831
The guy has a name.

346
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:10,902
- What?
- Sorry.

347
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:12,687
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

348
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:14,447
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

349
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,821
Just massaging away.

350
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,667
Fucking weird.

351
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,584
Have you finished playing?

352
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,387
You can't feel a thing?

353
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,098
Have you gone mad?!

354
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:41,758
He's experimenting.

355
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,393
He can't feel a thing.

356
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:44,932
You'll burn him!

357
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,190
Lawyer.

358
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,066
Lawyer.

359
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,784
That's personal.
I'll read it later.

360
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,199
The "personal" file?

361
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,039
Trash.

362
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:15,921
She's not bad.

363
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:18,962
How about a "hooker" file?

364
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:26,928
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:28,596
Thank you.

366
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:34,894
Do you mind?

367
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,407
Sorry.

368
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,163
Shit, I keep forgetting.

369
00:29:55,802 --> 00:29:57,008
Shit, sorry.

370
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,226
That feels good.

371
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:10,221
Driss, come here, please.

372
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:12,978
Can you hear me?

373
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,357
Come here, please.

374
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:28,698
What?

375
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,331
It's nearly nine. Philippe's waiting.

376
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:35,463
Nine already? This bath gel
takes ages to foam.

377
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,623
What a pigsty.

378
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,837
Can you make my coffee?

379
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:40,001
The baby monitor!

380
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,719
Always with you!

381
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:43,887
And Nutella!

382
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,675
Not that jam made with weird fruit!

383
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,617
I'm not getting in this.

384
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,042
And I'm not loading you
into the back like a horse.

385
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,296
What's this?

386
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:19,378
That one's less suitable.

387
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,840
Meaning?

388
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,051
Unfortunately,
we need to be pragmatic.

389
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:29,050
Pragmatic?

390
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:34,188
Holy fuck.

391
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:36,771
Listen to that.

392
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,643
- It feels so good.
- It's great.

393
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:40,062
This is good.

394
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,606
She's nervy.

395
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:44,319
Let's go!

396
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:56,915
The neighbor keeps parking there.

397
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,043
He thinks it's his space.

398
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:04,002
Not for much longer.

399
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:08,594
How's it going?

400
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:12,101
Am I bothering you, Blondie?
Want a coffee?

401
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:16,431
Come on.

402
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,692
- Go on, read this!
- "Keep free at all times."

403
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:20,852
Louder!

404
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:22,820
That's the way.

405
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,777
- Read it all.
- "Reserved parking."

406
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:27,109
Get that into your thick skull
and move!

407
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,195
Go on, Blondie, piss off!

408
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,129
We open Tuesday.
It'll be sold by then.

409
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:44,421
Can we go?

410
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,963
You've been there an hour.
Time to switch channels.

411
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:52,926
There's a lot of serenity in it.
A certain violence too.

412
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,310
It's very touching.

413
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,139
T ouching? Red splashes on white?

414
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:58,897
How much is it?

415
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,148
Thirty thousand euros, I think,
but I'll check.

416
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:03,853
Yeah, check.

417
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,440
That price seems way high to me.

418
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,617
You can't buy this crap!
It's not possible!

419
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,159
It is possible.

420
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:17,041
The guy wants 30 grand
for a nosebleed!

421
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,043
Tell me, Driss,

422
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,170
why are people interested in art?

423
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:24,958
- It's all business, I guess.
- No.

424
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,678
It's the trace
of our passage on this earth.

425
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:30,463
Bullshit.

426
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,509
For 50 euros,
I'll do you a trace of my passage.

427
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,142
I'll even add some blue!

428
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,895
Enough. Give me a chocolate.

429
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:40,352
No.

430
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:42,934
Give me a chocolate.

431
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:45,945
No handy, no candy.

432
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:50,779
It's a joke.

433
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:52,652
I'm kidding.

434
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:55,238
- It's a joke?
- Yes.

435
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,532
- A joke.
- It's a good one.

436
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,621
A very good joke.

437
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,211
That's the punch line, see.

438
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:04,122
But in your case...

439
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,415
Come on.

440
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,217
- It's wicked.
- It's a good joke.

441
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,296
You got no hands, Philippe.

442
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,300
I'll tell it to Marge Simpson.

443
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,811
I was wrong about the price.

444
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:25,147
It's 41,500 euros.

445
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,228
I'll take it.

446
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:29,146
You will?

447
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,534
Hi, Philippe.

448
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,243
How are you doing?

449
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,463
You summoned me, so here I am.

450
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:46,835
I'm listening.

451
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:49,800
What's so urgent?

452
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,261
I didn't summon you.

453
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:59,394
You must have some idea
why I'm here.

454
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:03,355
Who is this fellow?

455
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,642
Everyone's worried.

456
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,146
Yvonne tells me
he's reckless, violent...

457
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,564
He hit a neighbor?

458
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,239
I don't need to tell you
you have to be vigilant.

459
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,246
Don't let just anyone
into your home,

460
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,077
especially not in your state.

461
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:26,292
I'm not really sure
you know whom you're dealing with.

462
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,669
Carry on.

463
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,586
I called Sivot
at the Justice Ministry.

464
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,756
The boy isn't Al Capone,

465
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,050
but young Driss has a record.

466
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,310
He just did six months for robbery.

467
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,268
On top of the rest...

468
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:48,192
...I'm told he's useless.

469
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,523
Be careful.

470
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,904
These street guys have no pity.

471
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,323
That's it exactly.

472
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,782
That's what I want. No pity.

473
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:02,115
He often hands me the phone
because he forgets.

474
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,040
T rue, he isn't compassionate.

475
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,417
But he's strong, with arms and legs.

476
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,458
His brain works, he's healthy.

477
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:15,220
So, all the rest,
given my state, as you call it,

478
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,052
his background and so on,
I don't give a shit.

479
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,050
As you wish.

480
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,684
Will that be all?

481
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,393
Magalie...

482
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,066
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

483
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,357
I want to show you something.

484
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,233
What is it?

485
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,573
Chill, you can always say no.

486
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,954
One minute then.

487
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,245
So?

488
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:50,709
So I have a bathtub.

489
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:52,916
That's all.

490
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:55,377
Very interesting.

491
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:01,011
- And...
- We could take a bath.

492
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:02,759
There's plenty of room.

493
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,265
I have bath salts and foam.

494
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,686
Why not?

495
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,519
Yeah. Why not?

496
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,022
Go on then, get undressed.

497
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,189
Look at you!

498
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,404
The saucy kind. I like it.

499
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,865
OK, I'll get undressed.

500
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,749
What?

501
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,410
Where are you going?

502
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:30,874
You said yes!

503
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,251
Just a quick rinse!

504
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:38,586
What's with you?

505
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:41,723
I'm always tense
when the mail arrives.

506
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:45,138
As Apollinaire said:

507
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:51,183
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter from you..."

508
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,191
Slower, you're losing me.

509
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:56,445
I'm at "As Apollinaire said:"

510
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,902
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter..."

511
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,534
You may not realize,
but this is private.

512
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,957
No, I didn't realize.

513
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:09,207
Give me that.

514
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:11,164
Only if you explain.

515
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,330
There's nothing to explain.

516
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,464
He writes letters.

517
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,212
Letters?

518
00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:18,341
Who to?

519
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,219
Usually to women.

520
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:21,469
Come on, who?

521
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,054
One in particular. Eléonore.

522
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,515
Who? We've never seen her.

523
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:30,145
How come?

524
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:32,022
It's an epistolary relationship.

525
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:39,940
Meaning they write to each other.
They correspond solely by mail.

526
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,733
No need to spell it out.

527
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,696
The blue envelopes?

528
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:51,367
He's hot stuff.

529
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,082
He epistoles.

530
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:56,038
How about you?

531
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:57,916
No lover in sight?

532
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,385
Albert the gardener, say?

533
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:02,796
Certainly not!

534
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,512
I've seen the longing looks
he gives you.

535
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,052
Am I wrong? Yes or no?

536
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,642
Stop it, it's ridiculous.

537
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:14,102
Has he slipped it to you?

538
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:16,017
- What?
- His little cucumber.

539
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,025
What?

540
00:39:21,784 --> 00:39:23,115
I must be dreaming.

541
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:24,492
Albert, Albert.

542
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,946
He will soon.

543
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,300
Shit!

544
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,148
Are you OK?

545
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:03,982
Want some music?

546
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,135
It's all right.

547
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:31,638
Calm down.

548
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:51,282
Take it easy.

549
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:52,822
Try to breathe slowly.

550
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,619
You're with me.

551
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,665
Take it easy.

552
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:09,638
Try to breathe slowly.

553
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:15,519
It's all right.

554
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,711
I need air!

555
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:43,631
I need air!

556
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,660
Shit!

557
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,880
It's good to breathe.

558
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,376
What time is it?

559
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:30,465
I don't know. Around 4:00 a.m.

560
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:35,175
It's ages
since I saw Paris by night.

561
00:42:36,312 --> 00:42:38,052
What happened?

562
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,845
The medication has its limits.

563
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,728
Doctors call them phantom pains.

564
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,069
I feel like a frozen steak
tossed onto a red-hot griddle.

565
00:42:51,952 --> 00:42:54,489
I feel nothing but suffer anyway.

566
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,787
Surely something could help.

567
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,958
That could.

568
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:12,508
We're all sick for that,
me worse than you probably.

569
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:18,810
I wanted to ask you...
With women...

570
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,015
How do you manage?

571
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,148
You adapt.

572
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,650
So can you do it or not?

573
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,482
You may not realize,

574
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:32,194
but I feel nothing
from my neck to my toes.

575
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,491
So you can't.

576
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,662
It's not that simple.

577
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,666
I can, but it's not my decision.

578
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,997
And you can find pleasure elsewhere.

579
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:45,160
Yeah?

580
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:46,579
You've no idea.

581
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,840
You're right. How, for example?

582
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:52,084
For example, the ears.

583
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,175
The ears?

584
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,683
The ears are a highly sensitive
erogenous zone.

585
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,810
You get your ears licked?

586
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,890
I'd never have guessed.

587
00:44:09,738 --> 00:44:10,727
Philippe?

588
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:28,245
- Try this. It'll help.
- What is this crap?

589
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,339
It can't hurt you.

590
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:32,799
Drag on it.

591
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,176
Go on, drag on it.

592
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:37,634
Take it easy. Share it.

593
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:40,883
Again.

594
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:45,683
One more time.

595
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,223
That's enough for now.

596
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,107
Sorry, but you really get off
with your ears?

597
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:56,240
If your ears are red,
that means you're turned on?

598
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,866
Exactly.

599
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:00,870
Sometimes they're hard when I wake.

600
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:04,745
- Both of them?
- Yes!

601
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:11,540
I met my wife Alice
when we were students.

602
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:14,671
She was tall, very elegant,

603
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,130
with laughing eyes.

604
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,547
Is she the blond in the photos?

605
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,177
She's not bad.

606
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,684
What we had was incredible.

607
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,266
I hope you experience that one day.

608
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,187
Fuck, I loved her so much!
I loved her so much.

609
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,740
Then she got pregnant.

610
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:45,657
Five successive miscarriages.

611
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:52,922
Then the verdict came in.
An incurable, terminal illness.

612
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:55,921
We decided to adopt.

613
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,056
Waiter!

614
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:12,937
Excuse me!

615
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,066
Excuse me!

616
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:22,484
Yes?

617
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:26,655
A tarte tatin, please.

618
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:31,623
Cooked.
The chocolate cake was raw.

619
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:35,836
It was all squashy and gooey.
Weird.

620
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,047
That's what molten cake is.

621
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:40,961
- So that's why.
- Yes.

622
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,051
I'll have a tarte tatin anyway.

623
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:45,557
I've always loved competition,

624
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:47,844
extreme sports, speed.

625
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:50,058
Going faster, higher.

626
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:53,523
A paraglider gave me that.

627
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:57,107
I was high in the sky,
looking down at things, breathing.

628
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,114
I was raised to think
we pissed on the world.

629
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,234
Some water. My mouth's dry.

630
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,202
The joint does that.

631
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,501
And what else?

632
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:13,660
Makes you hungry

633
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,955
and chatty.

634
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,008
But bad weather can be fatal
when paragliding.

635
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,890
And you flew anyway?

636
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:31,020
Yes, maybe to suffer like Alice.
I knew she'd never recover.

637
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:37,022
I broke the third and fourth vertebrae.
Now only fly in my mind.

638
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,859
When the pain eases,
I have my thoughts.

639
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,026
My real handicap
isn't being in a chair.

640
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,952
It's living without her.

641
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:56,329
What do the doctors say?

642
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:00,091
With the advances in medicine,
they'll keep me going to 70

643
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,922
with massages and pick-me-ups.

644
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:06,055
It's expensive,
but I'm a rich invalid.

645
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:11,059
I'd have shot myself.

646
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,972
That's not easy in my condition.

647
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,061
True.

648
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:18,437
That sucks.

649
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,320
What's the date today?

650
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:23,901
The eighth or the ninth.

651
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:25,486
It's official then.

652
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,030
What is?

653
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,569
You've won your bet.

654
00:48:29,123 --> 00:48:31,079
Your trial period's over.

655
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,160
I'm hired then?

656
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,074
Yes, you're hired.

657
00:48:34,503 --> 00:48:36,243
Can I count on you now?

658
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:38,287
- Yes.
- Good.

659
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:41,081
Start by giving my Fabergé egg back.

660
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,552
Alice gave me one each year.

661
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:48,510
I have 25, one for each year
we were together.

662
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:50,599
I cherish it.

663
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:55,104
I don't know why you...
Wasn't me.

664
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,106
What did you lose again?

665
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:12,571
Mina!

666
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,780
Mina!

667
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:19,127
- What's up?
- Get in.

668
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:22,209
Buckle up.

669
00:49:33,645 --> 00:49:35,010
How's it going?

670
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:42,605
How's school?

671
00:49:45,157 --> 00:49:46,818
Why don't you text me back?

672
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:50,067
I was busy.

673
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:55,573
Let's hear it.
Who called?

674
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:58,914
A cop, to talk to Mom.
I put on a deep voice

675
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:00,623
and said we'd go.

676
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:04,457
Found my egg?

677
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:09,712
Have you found it?

678
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,927
Screw your stone egg.
I haven't found it.

679
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:23,775
What did you say?

680
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:25,686
What could I say?

681
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:28,196
I only had 30 grams on me.

682
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:31,609
For that you get a spell in custody,
then it's bye-bye.

683
00:50:31,787 --> 00:50:33,323
Let's get a kebab.

684
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,909
I'm not getting in that!

685
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,072
Let go of me.

686
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:38,161
Where are you going?

687
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,826
Who's driving you?

688
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,084
Get lost!

689
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:43,792
It's not your business.

690
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:45,418
Piss off!

691
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,186
Fuck!

692
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:03,270
"Her shining eyes
are made of charming minerals

693
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:06,230
and in this strange,
symbolic world..."

694
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,779
"And in this strange...

695
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,865
...symbolic...

696
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,029
...world..."

697
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,903
Fucking boring!

698
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:21,037
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

699
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,752
Is that with an "i" or a "y"?

700
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:26,254
This is killing my mind.

701
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:29,462
"Sphinx" is with an "i."

702
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:31,627
Why bother with this crap?

703
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:34,547
Sphinxes, daisies, angels...

704
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:37,011
You'd go for this stuff?

705
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,143
True, one could be more direct.

706
00:51:42,274 --> 00:51:44,606
"And ancient sphinx..." Go on.

707
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:46,437
What's she look like?

708
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:49,228
I don't know.
That's not what matters.

709
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:53,741
It's intellectual and emotional,
not physical.

710
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,742
I want a mind-to-mind relationship.

711
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:59,701
If she's a troll,
it'll be mind-to-troll!

712
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,041
Very subtle. Really.

713
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:05,827
What can I say?

714
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:07,542
Bravo.

715
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,627
How long's it been going on?

716
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:17,214
Please.

717
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:19,971
Six months.

718
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,601
Six months?

719
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:24,013
And you've never seen her?

720
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,604
Maybe she's fat and ugly.
Or handicapped.

721
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:31,111
At the end of the poem
put "How's your weight?"

722
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,862
Thank you very much
for your sound advice, Driss.

723
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,735
Let's carry on. Where was I?

724
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:43,036
A sphinx was eating daisies
with an angel,

725
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,121
then running and doing stuff.

726
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:47,248
Let me see...

727
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:50,209
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

728
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:54,385
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

729
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:55,543
Call her!

730
00:52:56,014 --> 00:53:00,178
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

731
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,633
Call her, OK!

732
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,013
I can get more across
with the written word, OK?

733
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:07,977
He's incredible.

734
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,860
I'm going to find her number.
This is stressing me out.

735
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,986
Dunkirk. That's bad.

736
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:18,571
Put that down.

737
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:20,360
No beauty queens there.

738
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:22,449
Only trolls.

739
00:53:22,624 --> 00:53:24,239
Put that down right now.

740
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:25,828
Her number's here.

741
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:28,210
That means she wants you to call!

742
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,245
Put it down, please!

743
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:32,289
She wrote her number here.

744
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:35,300
That means:
"Call me, I'll lick your ear."

745
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,128
What's he doing?
Don't call her.

746
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:40,672
Enough poetry after six months.

747
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,799
He's totally crazy!

748
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:44,722
I won't speak to her.

749
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:47,729
I bet she has an accent.
They talk weird up there.

750
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:49,264
Hang up!

751
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:50,979
"I want my Philippe."

752
00:53:51,153 --> 00:53:52,518
She's gonna get him.

753
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:55,399
The voice sounds OK.

754
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,453
Improvise, talk about the daisies...

755
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:06,073
Eléonore? It's Philippe.

756
00:54:06,918 --> 00:54:11,787
I'm calling because I really wanted
to hear the sound of your voice

757
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:15,298
and with that first "hello,"

758
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:17,926
- I'm fulfilled.
- I'll put her on.

759
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,423
T oo wordy.
Try simpler sentences.

760
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:25,308
Eléonore, it's Philippe.

761
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,386
Philippe?

762
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,646
I was writing you a letter and...

763
00:54:30,942 --> 00:54:34,355
...it just hit me,
"Why don't I call her?"

764
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,361
Ask her weight!

765
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:39,777
- I'm sorry?
- No, nothing.

766
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:41,317
"I'm in mourning,

767
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,451
I weep, I'm afraid.

768
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,282
Lord, fresh air..."

769
00:54:45,457 --> 00:54:47,823
Yes, "The Foolish Virgin."
You're unbeatable.

770
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:49,332
I love Rimbaud too.

771
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:51,414
Sorry, I was here first.

772
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,954
Eléonore, I'm so happy.

773
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:56,919
What a chatterbox!

774
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,210
There's no stopping you now.

775
00:54:59,387 --> 00:55:00,718
T ake care.

776
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,006
Let's all take care,
let's all lick our ears.

777
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:05,264
Excellent.

778
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,925
Well?

779
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:10,470
Good news and not so good news.

780
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:12,055
The good news?

781
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:13,349
Fifty-three kilos.

782
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,358
Fifty-three kilos, that's good.

783
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,860
Unless she's one meter tall.

784
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:21,736
The bad news is, she wants a photo.

785
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,401
- So?
- Very funny.

786
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:26,820
Your tickets, please.

787
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:27,908
Good evening.

788
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,072
Right here.

789
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:30,866
- OK.
- Have a good evening.

790
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:33,535
If you want us,
we won't move from there.

791
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:35,249
Especially him.

792
00:55:37,843 --> 00:55:40,630
What do you think women want?

793
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,044
I don't know.

794
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:44,797
Beauty, charm, elegance...

795
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:48,676
Bullshit!
They want dough and security.

796
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:51,678
Just ask him.

797
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,265
And you have what it takes.

798
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,480
I'm naïve.

799
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:01,272
I hope to charm with more
than just my bank account.

800
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:06,569
After six months reading
your lame poems, she's hot for you.

801
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,409
She's an original all right.
The chair won't bother her.

802
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:12,700
That's true.

803
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:15,914
Up north,
guys drink and beat women.

804
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:17,704
She'll be safe with you.

805
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,293
Bastard.

806
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,417
Pragmatic, right?

807
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,587
I don't know.

808
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:29,554
If she sends her photo,
it means she wants to go further.

809
00:56:30,729 --> 00:56:33,812
Send a photo of you
without the chair really showing.

810
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:36,473
It doesn't have to be
a telethon one

811
00:56:36,651 --> 00:56:38,687
with you drooling

812
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,353
and looking like shit.

813
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,362
OK, I get the message.

814
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,246
This guy's not well.
He's not at all well.

815
00:57:00,342 --> 00:57:01,377
What?

816
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:06,511
He's a tree?

817
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:08,589
A singing tree.

818
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,271
That's German!

819
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,599
What?

820
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:21,985
It's in German.

821
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:23,361
In German.

822
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:26,068
You're a nutcase.

823
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,192
What a drag.

824
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,985
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

825
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:31,243
Fuck!

826
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,284
Good-looking back then.

827
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,161
Which one?

828
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:44,090
This one.

829
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:50,388
Or maybe this one.

830
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:55,556
Sure, there's a problem,
but you look good.

831
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:57,896
Wanna try it?

832
00:57:58,066 --> 00:57:59,101
I don't know.

833
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:02,526
- Wasn't it a blast talking to her?
- Yes, it was.

834
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:03,685
That's all?

835
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,979
- A fucking blast.
- So?

836
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:09,448
Put the damn photo in an envelope!

837
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,907
There.
The very words I wanted to hear.

838
00:58:17,419 --> 00:58:18,659
Gimme a cig.

839
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:20,835
Don't you ever knock?

840
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,620
You're painting?

841
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,252
- Get out.
- Seriously? You're painting?

842
00:58:25,427 --> 00:58:26,963
Learned to read too?

843
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:29,423
What do you want?
Get lost!

844
00:58:29,597 --> 00:58:31,383
Going to hit a woman?

845
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:32,923
You do that in your country?

846
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:34,841
You're whacked! Get out.

847
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,635
- Get out now!
- I'll go when I want.

848
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,269
Get the hell out!

849
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,476
- I've decided to go now.
- Get out!

850
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:42,189
Shit.

851
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,692
Replace that photo with the other.

852
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:50,240
Make sure to post it yourself.
And be discreet.

853
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:52,280
As you wish.

854
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:55,570
Put the other photo in the trash.

855
00:58:55,957 --> 00:58:57,117
I'm blowing a fuse!

856
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,624
HOOKERS

857
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,838
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter!

858
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:06,664
I was painting.

859
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:09,042
You were painting?

860
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,710
I'm telling you,

861
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,512
set her straight
or I'll demolish her!

862
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,140
- Calm down.
- No, I won't calm down!

863
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,350
I'm your arms and legs here?

864
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:21,605
- That's right.
- I want to be your hands

865
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:25,393
to give her a slap
'cause all you can do is run her down!

866
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,733
Aren't you overdoing it?
Yvonne?

867
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:37,370
She could do
with being set straight a bit.

868
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,575
A bit?

869
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,661
At 1 6, she dresses like a tramp!

870
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,451
She keeps making out
with mop-head.

871
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,412
But that's not my problem.

872
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,629
What bothers me
are her high and mighty airs,

873
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:51,714
the way she talks to you and me.

874
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,755
No respect.
She treats us like dogs.

875
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,429
Say the word and I'll set her straight.

876
00:59:58,603 --> 00:59:59,763
I get the message.

877
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:01,769
Let me talk to her.

878
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:06,774
So talk to her, and fast.

879
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,986
Do something.
Set her straight.

880
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,780
He paints? What does he paint?

881
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:14,691
No idea.

882
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:36,884
Wake up.

883
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:38,798
Rise and shine.

884
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:45,810
Here we go.
Power-hose time.

885
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:32,318
Respect the people
I need around me.

886
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,945
It's intolerable.

887
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:35,446
Is that clear?

888
01:01:35,617 --> 01:01:37,323
Be tougher on her!

889
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,860
I don't want that mop-head around.

890
01:01:40,038 --> 01:01:42,450
- Give me a break.
- I'm not through!

891
01:01:42,624 --> 01:01:45,457
I have to run you down
to get you to obey?

892
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,868
There, he's done it!

893
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,498
You painted this?

894
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:54,665
Yeah.

895
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:56,792
I love it.

896
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:01,056
I'm not saying
I'd necessarily hang it

897
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:02,591
in my place, but...

898
01:02:04,062 --> 01:02:05,643
What can we get for it?

899
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,181
We'll see.

900
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,774
See more or see less?

901
01:02:12,946 --> 01:02:14,152
It's...

902
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:16,687
Are you nuts?

903
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,697
C'mon! No tongues, OK.

904
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:19,983
You're sick in the head!

905
01:02:20,995 --> 01:02:23,077
I don't believe this.

906
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:24,779
Speed it up a bit.

907
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,164
I'm flat-out.

908
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:29,791
You're way too slow!

909
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,169
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool?

910
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,420
That's cool.

911
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:34,710
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool,
right?

912
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:37,171
No faster?

913
01:02:37,345 --> 01:02:38,926
- That's the top speed.
- OK.

914
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:14,587
Stick to the ears.

915
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,900
Yes, Yvonne.

916
01:03:37,071 --> 01:03:39,357
No, he can't hear.
He's nowhere near me.

917
01:03:40,074 --> 01:03:41,814
He can't hear me, Yvonne.

918
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:46,240
We'll be there at 8:30 sharp.

919
01:03:46,414 --> 01:03:47,449
We'll push it back.

920
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,285
Goodbye, Yvonne.

921
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:51,374
She's stressed out?

922
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:55,036
Yes, your birthday surprise
will be half an hour later.

923
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:58,752
She gets into a terrible state
every year.

924
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:02,214
She invites my whole family.
It all goes like clockwork.

925
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:06,806
They come to see
if I'm still alive.

926
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:08,766
The annual check-up.

927
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:13,387
I pretend to be surprised.

928
01:04:14,025 --> 01:04:15,686
We all make an effort,

929
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,021
but, to be honest,
we all get bored shitless.

930
01:04:57,735 --> 01:04:58,724
Excuse me...

931
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:00,772
Excuse me...

932
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,905
Do you mind moving along?

933
01:05:08,788 --> 01:05:10,528
Yes, I do mind.

934
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:11,662
All right.

935
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,869
Thank you. Move along.

936
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,084
Move just one seat along.

937
01:05:18,506 --> 01:05:19,791
Very kind.

938
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,100
A suit changes a man.

939
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:35,762
You look good.

940
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:39,357
You look like Obama.

941
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:42,143
Yeah?

942
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:46,985
She's hot for me, I can tell.

943
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,525
Barack Obama.

944
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:49,818
Classy.

945
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,949
That's like comparing you...

946
01:05:56,961 --> 01:05:58,121
...to George Bush...

947
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:00,412
...or Nixon.

948
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:12,549
What's up? You'll miss the concert.

949
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:13,933
Leave me alone!

950
01:06:15,354 --> 01:06:16,343
Got your period?

951
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:17,894
Piss off!

952
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:19,100
What's wrong?

953
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:21,228
Elisa...

954
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:25,187
- Leave me be!
- What did you take?

955
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:28,151
What did you do?

956
01:06:31,245 --> 01:06:32,234
Where's this from?

957
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,032
Yvonne's purse.

958
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,196
Imodium?

959
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,664
What was this for?

960
01:06:37,835 --> 01:06:39,245
To kill yourself?

961
01:06:40,004 --> 01:06:41,665
You won't shit for months now!

962
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:43,162
Leave me alone.

963
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,546
Hold on...

964
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,963
You took Tylenol too?
You're dying.

965
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,210
This is bad!

966
01:06:51,182 --> 01:06:53,138
Shall I call an ambulance?

967
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:54,840
Why did you do it?

968
01:06:56,354 --> 01:06:57,343
Because of Bastien.

969
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,057
What about him?

970
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:01,564
He dumped me,
he doesn't give a shit.

971
01:07:01,734 --> 01:07:03,599
He even called me a slut.

972
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,150
That's bad.

973
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:07,732
It'd suit everyone if I died.

974
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:10,068
Stop talking crap. Come downstairs.

975
01:07:10,243 --> 01:07:12,950
Go to see him for me.
Talk to him.

976
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,030
Who?

977
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:16,116
Bastien. I'll pay you.

978
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:18,531
Pay me? Are you out of your mind?

979
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,825
Spare me this childish shit.

980
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,083
Please!

981
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:24,746
I talk to Bastien
and you pay me.

982
01:07:25,716 --> 01:07:27,206
Who do you think I am?

983
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:30,752
Driss, please!

984
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,049
How much?

985
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:36,216
Jerk.

986
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:42,229
It has style.
There's a certain touch.

987
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,604
But 11,000 for an unknown artist...

988
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:54,609
But if I say no
and the value triples, I'll regret it

989
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,698
and you'll say, "I told you so."

990
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:01,874
He has a show in London?

991
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,329
And Berlin soon.

992
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,331
Berlin too.

993
01:08:08,426 --> 01:08:10,257
I don't know.

994
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:13,844
Eleven thousand euros
is quite a sum.

995
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,965
Come on, fill me in here.

996
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:18,553
Is she with someone?

997
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,560
All right. Yes. Fred.

998
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,720
Fred?

999
01:08:23,858 --> 01:08:25,314
They've been together two years...

1000
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,275
...but with ups and downs.

1001
01:08:28,863 --> 01:08:30,273
Things are often tense.

1002
01:08:31,324 --> 01:08:33,280
They're pretty rocky now.

1003
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:35,783
Maybe because of me?

1004
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,285
- Has she mentioned me?
- No.

1005
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,744
Of course. A little.

1006
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:44,204
Fuck! She's hot for me.

1007
01:08:47,632 --> 01:08:48,667
You're bullshitting me?

1008
01:08:49,216 --> 01:08:50,922
- No.
- Bullshit away!

1009
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,958
I'll bed Magalie one day.

1010
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,885
Hope keeps us going.

1011
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:58,681
Easy on those
if you have stomach trouble.

1012
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:01,009
I'm no doctor,

1013
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:03,599
but Imodium means there's a problem.

1014
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:15,196
Excuse me.

1015
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:18,155
Can I ask a favor of you?

1016
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,612
One more piece just for me?

1017
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:23,160
No, we were cool.

1018
01:09:25,378 --> 01:09:26,743
Vivaldi's Four Seasons:

1019
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,665
"L'Estate."

1020
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:29,954
You'll like this.

1021
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:31,498
Shit.

1022
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:50,308
Come on,
don't tell me you feel nothing.

1023
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,149
Not a thing.
It doesn't do a thing for me.

1024
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,405
Music's something you dance to.

1025
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,862
Let's try something else.

1026
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,741
I know that one.

1027
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:08,368
That's an ad.

1028
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:10,411
For coffee.

1029
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,256
Oyez, by mandate,

1030
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:21,093
I'm expected at the chateau...

1031
01:10:21,934 --> 01:10:24,425
...to bring the minstrels there.

1032
01:10:26,063 --> 01:10:27,178
I'm a good knight.

1033
01:10:28,899 --> 01:10:30,764
That one's fishy.

1034
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:33,480
I see people without clothes.

1035
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:38,281
They're running.
I see them running naked.

1036
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:39,565
And giggling.

1037
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,359
All right.

1038
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:43,573
Bach was hot.

1039
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,999
Women went for him.
The Barry White of his day.

1040
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,082
I know this one!

1041
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:54,338
I know it. Everyone knows it.

1042
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,832
Sure!

1043
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:58,959
"This is the Paris Benefit Office.

1044
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,421
All our lines are currently busy.

1045
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,596
Waiting time: two years."

1046
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,391
"T om and Jerry," right?

1047
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:22,107
"T om and Jerry."

1048
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:25,118
What a jerk.

1049
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,454
Someone help me.
A masterpiece.

1050
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,912
OK, after your classics,

1051
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:32,452
Iet's listen to mine.

1052
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:34,419
Earth, Wind & Fire.

1053
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,579
It's a killer.

1054
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:40,543
Something else, huh?

1055
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:43,053
Definitely something else.

1056
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:46,466
Call my name, I won't answer.

1057
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,057
- Driss!
- I'm not answering.

1058
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:51,470
Here we go.

1059
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,047
It's a birthday party!

1060
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:27,715
Let's dance!
Come on, move!

1061
01:12:28,602 --> 01:12:29,591
It's his birthday!

1062
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:32,094
Yeah, Yvonne.

1063
01:12:32,273 --> 01:12:33,353
Ace, Albert.

1064
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,533
Spin! Spin!

1065
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:24,105
All right.

1066
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:26,570
Time for my little gift.

1067
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:29,868
I didn't want to spoil things

1068
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:32,621
if she turned out to be ugly.
You never know.

1069
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,577
She answered anyhow.

1070
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:36,450
Good night.

1071
01:13:38,672 --> 01:13:41,129
I'll open it. You'll take ages.

1072
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:45,292
Well?

1073
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:49,254
- She's not a troll.
- Really?

1074
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:51,678
Shit.

1075
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,351
The only one in Dunkirk
with all her teeth!

1076
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:56,474
There's a note too.

1077
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:59,231
"I'll be in Paris next week.

1078
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,687
I'll be expecting your call."
And three dots!

1079
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:04,987
Meaning what?

1080
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,898
- Any idea?
- It's a good sign?

1081
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:09,942
You bet. She wants nooky.

1082
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,827
Three dots. One, two and three dots.

1083
01:14:12,998 --> 01:14:14,238
"She wants nooky."

1084
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,372
I'm getting nooky.

1085
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,035
It's looking good.

1086
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:20,498
How can I sleep now?

1087
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:22,584
You'll manage.

1088
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,339
I'll put her here.

1089
01:14:25,469 --> 01:14:26,709
She'll watch you sleep.

1090
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:29,966
Good night, Philippe.

1091
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:32,344
Sweet dreams.

1092
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,103
Try the cap again.

1093
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,069
Not bad.

1094
01:14:50,244 --> 01:14:53,077
No way!
He looks like a farmer.

1095
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:55,659
- Go for traditional.
- That's what I said.

1096
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,415
- How's this?
- No good. Too traditional.

1097
01:14:58,585 --> 01:15:01,668
Forget the caps and hats,
find something.

1098
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:04,622
Traditional or trendy?

1099
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:06,548
That's it.

1100
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:07,959
This works.

1101
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,843
The angler look?

1102
01:15:10,723 --> 01:15:11,929
We're off to Dunkirk.

1103
01:15:13,726 --> 01:15:15,933
I'll go with Yvonne. We'll be fine.

1104
01:15:16,103 --> 01:15:17,092
You sure?

1105
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:21,684
Yes, I'll manage.

1106
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:22,939
Fine.

1107
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,774
I'm a bit stressed out.

1108
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:31,698
It doesn't show. You look great.

1109
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,537
4ac minus b2.

1110
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:37,913
- Minus b2?
- Yeah.

1111
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,573
I got 20 instead.

1112
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:40,832
Come here, you.

1113
01:15:41,962 --> 01:15:43,793
Take a hike, Justin Bieber.

1114
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:45,959
Recognize me, Bastien?

1115
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:47,623
Yeah. What's up?

1116
01:15:47,801 --> 01:15:49,792
You said a bad thing to Elisa.

1117
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,460
- I said nothing.
- Shut up!

1118
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,130
Act like a man and apologize.

1119
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:55,423
OK, I'm sorry.

1120
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:56,590
Hands off.

1121
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,760
- Not to me, to her.
- Right.

1122
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:01,303
Bring her croissants each day.

1123
01:16:01,482 --> 01:16:03,143
- Plain or chocolate?
- What?

1124
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,557
Plain or chocolate?

1125
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,850
Whatever.

1126
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,609
Just do it right.

1127
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,316
You're nice to her.

1128
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:10,605
Now piss off.

1129
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:12,148
Go on, get lost.

1130
01:16:12,326 --> 01:16:14,157
And try using a barrette!

1131
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,450
What time is it?

1132
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:22,658
It's 4:45.

1133
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,713
Let's take the cap off.

1134
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:34,503
Good idea.

1135
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:44,688
Now what time is it?

1136
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:48,476
Forty-six or 47.
Time doesn't move very fast.

1137
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,986
I'd like a whisky.

1138
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:32,687
Another.

1139
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:34,401
Is that a good idea?

1140
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:35,902
A double!

1141
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:41,161
Waiter, a double whisky, please.

1142
01:18:12,446 --> 01:18:13,526
Driss?

1143
01:18:13,697 --> 01:18:15,562
Am I disturbing you?

1144
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:17,732
I'm at the gym. Well?

1145
01:18:17,951 --> 01:18:20,363
Do you feel like getting away?

1146
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:22,611
No questions asked?

1147
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:23,869
No questions, no.

1148
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,703
- You want to split?
- Exactly.

1149
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:28,700
And go where?

1150
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:31,537
T o breathe a little.

1151
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,671
Breathe a little?

1152
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,050
I'll shower and be right there.

1153
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,593
We're leaving. The cap...

1154
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,219
It's only just six...

1155
01:18:43,393 --> 01:18:44,428
We're leaving!

1156
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,301
Good evening.

1157
01:19:30,274 --> 01:19:33,266
Give him some champagne
to help him relax.

1158
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,940
I'm not tense.

1159
01:19:35,112 --> 01:19:36,318
- You're not?
- No.

1160
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:55,704
It's just us?

1161
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:58,590
No other people on board?

1162
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,966
Just us?

1163
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:21,772
I don't like this.

1164
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:22,939
Why not?

1165
01:20:23,994 --> 01:20:25,074
I don't know.

1166
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:28,863
Because you seem kind of jinxed.

1167
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,824
The accident, the wheelchair,

1168
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:32,991
your wife...

1169
01:20:33,587 --> 01:20:35,578
Sounds like the Kennedys.

1170
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:38,873
Miss?

1171
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:42,210
Could we have the package please?

1172
01:20:42,387 --> 01:20:43,376
Thank you.

1173
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:49,215
Thank you.

1174
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,514
Why?

1175
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:01,144
What the hell?

1176
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:05,191
Your value on the art market.
I managed to get 1 1,000 euros.

1177
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:08,911
Keep at it. You have talent.

1178
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:11,663
That's a great deal.
I sensed something.

1179
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,449
It all came about instinctively.

1180
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:18,496
With the music playing,
it made for a really good blend.

1181
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:22,504
It was a sort of revelation,
like I saw the light.

1182
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:23,834
Don't get carried away.

1183
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:26,674
Eleven thousand
for my first painting!

1184
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:28,718
What was that?

1185
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:31,808
Just a hole in the fuselage.

1186
01:21:31,978 --> 01:21:33,218
We won't make it.

1187
01:21:33,397 --> 01:21:35,388
T ell me what's up!

1188
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,312
- Glad to have known you.
- Not funny.

1189
01:21:39,486 --> 01:21:43,695
I know you're used to tragedy,
but I'm not.

1190
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,938
You gotta be nuts to do that.

1191
01:22:18,108 --> 01:22:19,143
A little.

1192
01:22:25,365 --> 01:22:26,821
I have to say something.

1193
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:29,658
You're a total headcase.

1194
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,201
Really?

1195
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,413
Now get Driss ready.

1196
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:40,002
Sure. No way I'm doing that.

1197
01:22:40,338 --> 01:22:42,750
I'll be over there taking photos.

1198
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,289
"Get Driss ready!"

1199
01:22:44,468 --> 01:22:46,629
How will you take photos?

1200
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,131
Laugh. I'm not doing it.

1201
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,606
Holy shit.

1202
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:04,059
I'm not going.

1203
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:06,068
- Hold on.
- How do I get this off?

1204
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,981
I don't have to do it.

1205
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:18,873
I'm not doing this!

1206
01:23:19,044 --> 01:23:21,205
I lost my fucking shoe!

1207
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:22,869
My shoe's down there.

1208
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:27,754
Motherfucker!
We're heading up!

1209
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:40,269
What the fuck!

1210
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,681
- What's going on?
- Hey, Driss.

1211
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:46,726
Relax, pal.

1212
01:23:47,447 --> 01:23:50,154
I'm relaxed,
but I want to be down there.

1213
01:23:54,704 --> 01:23:56,695
Fucking hell!

1214
01:24:01,378 --> 01:24:03,994
I'm having a blast!

1215
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,614
Where do you find an invalid?

1216
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:43,705
- I don't know.
- Where you leave him.

1217
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:46,503
That's a good one.

1218
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:49,209
Bastard.

1219
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,714
Someone for you, Driss.

1220
01:24:56,766 --> 01:24:58,597
What are you doing here?

1221
01:24:58,768 --> 01:25:01,384
I should ask you that.
You kept this quiet.

1222
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:02,803
How did you know?

1223
01:25:03,148 --> 01:25:05,514
Benefit sent this, with the address.

1224
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,599
What's that?

1225
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,146
Forget it.

1226
01:25:09,321 --> 01:25:11,277
- What happened?
- I fell off a scooter.

1227
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:12,938
You fell off a scooter?

1228
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:15,361
Get up.

1229
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:17,279
You fell... Come here.

1230
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:22,746
Shit!

1231
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:27,790
You sleep here?

1232
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:31,164
- So what happened?
- Nothing.

1233
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:32,583
Come on, tell me.

1234
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,342
Not your problem.

1235
01:25:34,512 --> 01:25:36,798
You're here, it's my problem!

1236
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:39,680
We got screwed.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

1237
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:41,011
No fucking way!

1238
01:25:41,186 --> 01:25:42,301
Does the old lady know?

1239
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:44,015
No, I'm handling it.

1240
01:25:44,189 --> 01:25:46,521
You're handling fuck all!
Quit busting my balls!

1241
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:49,057
Don't touch anything. Wait here!

1242
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:50,771
Can I lie down?

1243
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:52,777
Don't touch a thing!

1244
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,529
OK, I get it!

1245
01:25:55,075 --> 01:25:56,281
Watch it, OK!

1246
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,115
No, he's with me.

1247
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:04,330
Quit crying, Mina.

1248
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:06,620
It's just a scratch.

1249
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,376
No, he's fine.

1250
01:26:08,546 --> 01:26:10,707
Calm down, no one's killing no one.

1251
01:26:10,924 --> 01:26:13,336
That's all just empty threats.

1252
01:26:14,094 --> 01:26:16,881
I can't take care of him.
I gotta work.

1253
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,967
No, you don't tell her about it.

1254
01:26:20,183 --> 01:26:22,970
Stay in your room
if you want to cry.

1255
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:32,893
Time for bed?

1256
01:26:33,405 --> 01:26:35,441
I'll stay up a while longer.

1257
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:37,739
Sit down.

1258
01:26:39,786 --> 01:26:41,026
Sit down here.

1259
01:26:49,462 --> 01:26:51,168
What do you think of her?

1260
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:56,250
- She looks hot.
- OK. And what else?

1261
01:26:57,637 --> 01:27:00,174
Let's go up.
I need to do something.

1262
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,384
I imagine her standing up,

1263
01:27:02,559 --> 01:27:06,393
turning around
and I discover her face at last.

1264
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:13,228
The boy looks like you.
Adama, is that right?

1265
01:27:13,403 --> 01:27:14,392
That's right.

1266
01:27:14,988 --> 01:27:16,728
I spotted him earlier.

1267
01:27:16,906 --> 01:27:18,988
If I passed him on the street,

1268
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:21,241
I'd know he was your brother.

1269
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,280
That's funny.

1270
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,361
Why?

1271
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,121
He's not my brother.

1272
01:27:28,501 --> 01:27:29,832
He isn't?

1273
01:27:30,462 --> 01:27:32,043
It's complicated.

1274
01:27:33,506 --> 01:27:35,713
Is he your brother or not?

1275
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,338
OK, I get the message.

1276
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,598
Come on, let's go.

1277
01:27:53,193 --> 01:27:54,558
My parents...

1278
01:27:56,154 --> 01:27:57,769
...aren't my parents.

1279
01:27:58,782 --> 01:28:00,397
They're my uncle and aunt.

1280
01:28:01,326 --> 01:28:03,863
They fetched me from Senegal
when I was eight.

1281
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:08,455
They couldn't have kids
but a brother had loads.

1282
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,456
They picked the oldest.

1283
01:28:11,503 --> 01:28:12,583
Me.

1284
01:28:15,715 --> 01:28:17,455
My name's Bakary.

1285
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,966
That's my real name.

1286
01:28:20,845 --> 01:28:23,336
But other kids had that name
so they called me Idriss

1287
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:25,380
and that became Driss.

1288
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,346
And afterwards?

1289
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,762
Out of the blue,
my mother... my aunt

1290
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,352
got pregnant once
and then twice.

1291
01:28:35,193 --> 01:28:36,353
Then my uncle died.

1292
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:38,234
Other men, other kids.

1293
01:28:38,571 --> 01:28:40,482
Like I said, complicated.

1294
01:28:42,492 --> 01:28:45,484
Young Adama...
doesn't he need setting straight?

1295
01:28:54,546 --> 01:28:56,537
He came to get you, right?

1296
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:01,541
Driss...

1297
01:29:05,056 --> 01:29:06,887
I think we'll call it quits.

1298
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:11,017
You can't be pushing an invalid
for the rest of your life.

1299
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:15,513
After all your hard work,
you've earned your benefit.

1300
01:29:21,072 --> 01:29:23,529
Come on, let's go.

1301
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:26,691
Right.

1302
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:31,947
Bassari Bakary,

1303
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,410
Bakary Bassari.

1304
01:29:33,585 --> 01:29:36,418
It's beautiful.
It sounds like poetry.

1305
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:40,459
Almost like alliteration.
You know what alliteration is?

1306
01:29:40,633 --> 01:29:41,622
No.

1307
01:29:45,597 --> 01:29:48,009
Hello, Bastien.
See you tomorrow.

1308
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:50,970
We'll need a few more for brunch.

1309
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,726
OK. Goodbye, Yvonne.

1310
01:29:53,897 --> 01:29:55,808
- You got my sugar puffs?
- Yes.

1311
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,392
Thank you.

1312
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:59,558
- Say hi to Elisa.
- See you tomorrow.

1313
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:01,601
Hey, Bastien, pal, what's up?

1314
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:02,768
Come here!

1315
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:11,535
You're leaving then?

1316
01:30:12,665 --> 01:30:16,078
It's OK, I have your number.
We'll stay in touch.

1317
01:30:16,836 --> 01:30:19,077
It won't be easy, but be strong.

1318
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:23,127
T oo bad, I'm getting your room.
Water damage in mine.

1319
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:26,005
Maybe I'll stay then.

1320
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:28,044
We'll have to squeeze up.

1321
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,473
It'll be a bit cramped.
I don't live alone.

1322
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,388
Here.

1323
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:36,681
Meet Frédérique.

1324
01:30:40,151 --> 01:30:41,140
Hey.

1325
01:30:45,657 --> 01:30:46,612
All right.

1326
01:30:46,783 --> 01:30:47,898
What?

1327
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:49,236
I get it.

1328
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:51,739
So that's it. You're...

1329
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,368
Yes.

1330
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,117
I won't kiss you goodbye then.

1331
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:06,295
I'm not against a threesome.

1332
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,507
I'm up for it.
Not now, since I have to go.

1333
01:31:13,685 --> 01:31:16,051
But I can come back tonight.

1334
01:31:16,896 --> 01:31:18,136
I have to go now.

1335
01:31:18,314 --> 01:31:19,679
I'm kidding.

1336
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:26,360
Bye, guys.

1337
01:31:29,701 --> 01:31:31,487
Mr. Michel Sabourdi.

1338
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,624
Keep it on, channel two.

1339
01:31:40,712 --> 01:31:42,794
You're not angry about Magalie?

1340
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:45,671
No, you had me fooled.

1341
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,834
I couldn't figure out
why she kept resisting.

1342
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:55,093
A goodbye kiss?

1343
01:31:57,395 --> 01:31:58,555
All right.

1344
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:02,680
Yvonne.

1345
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,692
Always bullshitting me.

1346
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:08,774
See you.

1347
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:13,692
Just a second.

1348
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,703
We won't be needing this.

1349
01:32:24,297 --> 01:32:25,457
OK, bye.

1350
01:32:29,552 --> 01:32:30,962
Get your foot off there.

1351
01:32:31,137 --> 01:32:32,126
Come on.

1352
01:32:51,324 --> 01:32:52,689
Which bank?

1353
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:59,617
Could you move your car, please?
You're not allowed to park here.

1354
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:00,780
There's a sign.

1355
01:33:01,084 --> 01:33:02,199
I'll move it.

1356
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,540
I'll call you back.

1357
01:33:07,131 --> 01:33:08,621
Stop busting his balls.

1358
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,085
We're not driving.

1359
01:33:10,259 --> 01:33:11,669
Matter of principle.

1360
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:17,547
Wait over there for me.

1361
01:33:29,862 --> 01:33:31,272
What's going on?

1362
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:33,187
I'm coming.

1363
01:35:11,589 --> 01:35:13,580
I can cancel my date if you want.

1364
01:35:13,758 --> 01:35:15,749
No, certainly not. Why?

1365
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:18,543
Go out and have fun.

1366
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:21,796
OK, Yvonne. I'm ready.

1367
01:35:21,974 --> 01:35:23,510
Yes, just a second.

1368
01:35:24,143 --> 01:35:27,761
It's all ready.
You just have to serve it.

1369
01:35:27,939 --> 01:35:30,476
If there's a problem, call me.

1370
01:35:35,154 --> 01:35:36,894
You'll call me?

1371
01:35:39,116 --> 01:35:41,949
If you agree,
I'll serve you your dinner.

1372
01:35:43,454 --> 01:35:46,446
Take the coat off.
It's like being in a madhouse.

1373
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,989
All right.

1374
01:35:49,168 --> 01:35:50,829
Got a cigarette?

1375
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:52,751
No, I don't smoke.

1376
01:35:52,922 --> 01:35:53,911
Well, I used to.

1377
01:35:54,549 --> 01:35:57,962
I gave up a short while ago
and, to be honest,

1378
01:35:58,135 --> 01:35:59,841
it would be bad for you,

1379
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:04,847
even if you don't practice a sport,
for your lungs, your breathing...

1380
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,925
...and so on.

1381
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:10,394
You're not eating?

1382
01:37:15,379 --> 01:37:17,586
Watch what you're doing!

1383
01:37:17,757 --> 01:37:18,997
I'm so sorry.

1384
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:21,002
What is it?

1385
01:37:22,094 --> 01:37:25,803
You wanted a cranial massage.
Here's Mr. Jacquet.

1386
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:27,546
Hello, sir.

1387
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,512
Get out.
Leave me alone.

1388
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:33,431
- Get out!
- Is it me?

1389
01:37:33,606 --> 01:37:34,721
Not at all.

1390
01:37:35,358 --> 01:37:37,599
He got up in a bad mood.
Well, got up...

1391
01:37:39,904 --> 01:37:41,064
"He got up..."

1392
01:37:41,238 --> 01:37:43,524
What a prick. Asshole.

1393
01:37:45,076 --> 01:37:46,316
Driss Bassari.

1394
01:37:47,036 --> 01:37:48,025
Your turn.

1395
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,801
You got your license a month ago?

1396
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:07,552
I'd driven before.

1397
01:38:08,432 --> 01:38:11,595
Mostly on private roads, tracks,

1398
01:38:11,769 --> 01:38:15,057
estates, parking lots.
I'm a good driver.

1399
01:38:18,109 --> 01:38:20,316
I read your application.

1400
01:38:20,486 --> 01:38:23,978
You used one word
to describe yourself: pragmatic.

1401
01:38:24,281 --> 01:38:25,270
Yes.

1402
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:27,773
That's important.

1403
01:38:27,952 --> 01:38:31,319
There's another idea here
that you forgot to mention.

1404
01:38:31,497 --> 01:38:32,703
Really?

1405
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:36,658
Maybe you should consider
reading our slogan.

1406
01:38:36,836 --> 01:38:38,372
That's an alexandrine.

1407
01:38:39,088 --> 01:38:39,998
I'm sorry?

1408
01:38:40,172 --> 01:38:42,083
May-be you should

1409
01:38:42,258 --> 01:38:45,546
con-si-der read-ing our slo-gan.
Twelve feet.

1410
01:38:47,138 --> 01:38:48,127
It wasn't deliberate.

1411
01:38:48,723 --> 01:38:50,588
"In time and on time."

1412
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:54,726
And you have Dali's melting clocks
for the artistic side.

1413
01:38:56,021 --> 01:38:57,101
Maybe, yes.

1414
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:00,560
Do you like art?

1415
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:01,941
Yes.

1416
01:39:02,111 --> 01:39:04,102
- I like Michelangelo.
- Not bad.

1417
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,441
But I prefer the other Turtles.

1418
01:39:19,044 --> 01:39:20,033
I'm coming!

1419
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:22,453
Just a second!

1420
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:27,624
Are you OK?

1421
01:39:29,138 --> 01:39:30,469
Get the hell out.

1422
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:33,130
Some water? A compress?

1423
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:36,800
Get out.

1424
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,558
Get out!

1425
01:39:49,033 --> 01:39:50,022
Thanks, Bruno.

1426
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:51,691
Have a good weekend.

1427
01:39:51,869 --> 01:39:53,154
See you on Monday.

1428
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:55,031
What's wrong?

1429
01:39:55,206 --> 01:39:56,446
He's in a bad way.

1430
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:00,328
- Where is he?
- Just now, he was in the garden.

1431
01:40:15,184 --> 01:40:17,175
Hey, what's up, bro?

1432
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:20,177
What's with the beard?

1433
01:40:22,191 --> 01:40:23,101
Serpico?

1434
01:40:23,275 --> 01:40:24,310
Jean Jaurès?

1435
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:26,100
A metro station anyhow.

1436
01:40:26,278 --> 01:40:27,267
Victor Hugo?

1437
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:30,905
You've let yourself go.

1438
01:40:31,075 --> 01:40:32,656
Good thing I'm back.

1439
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:33,907
I'll be right in.

1440
01:41:28,173 --> 01:41:29,504
What do we do now?

1441
01:41:30,301 --> 01:41:32,041
You let me handle it now.

1442
01:43:17,324 --> 01:43:18,734
Not bad, huh?

1443
01:43:41,432 --> 01:43:43,468
A quick cut would settle it.

1444
01:43:44,852 --> 01:43:47,389
You're in great shape. I love it.

1445
01:43:50,983 --> 01:43:53,895
OK, you can open your eyes now.

1446
01:43:54,486 --> 01:43:55,601
That's hideous.

1447
01:43:56,113 --> 01:43:57,148
It's hideous!

1448
01:43:57,698 --> 01:43:59,234
- Horrible.
- It suits you.

1449
01:43:59,408 --> 01:44:00,397
No.

1450
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,902
Look! Sleeveless leather vest,

1451
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,037
spiked bracelet,
Village People style cap.

1452
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:09,619
Got it! Freddie Mercury!

1453
01:44:09,793 --> 01:44:11,829
You look just like him!

1454
01:44:12,004 --> 01:44:14,916
That's wicked.
You look like an orthodox priest.

1455
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:16,079
Or a Cossack!

1456
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:20,334
Come on!

1457
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:23,545
He's crazy.

1458
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:25,430
What are you doing?

1459
01:44:27,019 --> 01:44:28,225
I expect the worst.

1460
01:44:28,437 --> 01:44:29,722
No, this one's good. Look.

1461
01:44:33,358 --> 01:44:34,723
My grandfather.

1462
01:44:34,902 --> 01:44:35,982
Really?

1463
01:44:36,361 --> 01:44:39,068
Philippe, this mustache of yours,

1464
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:41,150
it really turns me on.

1465
01:44:41,325 --> 01:44:42,690
I'll shave it all off.

1466
01:44:42,868 --> 01:44:44,278
- Thank you.
- All right.

1467
01:44:45,996 --> 01:44:48,112
No, that's not funny.

1468
01:44:51,126 --> 01:44:52,332
Nein!

1469
01:44:52,503 --> 01:44:53,709
That's what you mean.

1470
01:44:54,129 --> 01:44:55,460
No, I don't agree.

1471
01:44:56,381 --> 01:44:59,088
Philippe, very angry.

1472
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:01,466
I'm just your plaything now.

1473
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:04,632
You'll end up in the loony bin.

1474
01:45:04,807 --> 01:45:07,139
Don't you feel like starting a war?

1475
01:45:07,309 --> 01:45:11,473
I think it's time
to shave all this off now.

1476
01:45:12,064 --> 01:45:13,600
You're having fun?

1477
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:16,356
You bet. How about Nazi invalids?

1478
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:19,234
It must have been weird
saluting like this.

1479
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:24,857
You've had your fun now.
Get rid of it.

1480
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:39,375
A booking in the name of Bassari.

1481
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,086
Table number eight.

1482
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:42,249
Follow me, please.

1483
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:49,173
This way.

1484
01:46:11,582 --> 01:46:14,540
I'm not staying for lunch, Philippe.

1485
01:46:16,712 --> 01:46:18,668
- Why not?
- But you won't be alone.

1486
01:46:19,882 --> 01:46:23,170
Actually, you have a date.

1487
01:46:23,552 --> 01:46:25,042
A date?

1488
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,300
What's going on?

1489
01:46:27,598 --> 01:46:29,429
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

1490
01:46:30,601 --> 01:46:32,637
Only this time, you can't split.

1491
01:46:34,897 --> 01:46:36,012
By the way...

1492
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:39,272
...it took me a while,

1493
01:46:39,443 --> 01:46:40,683
but I found it.

1494
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:43,234
Give her a kiss for me.

1495
01:46:44,573 --> 01:46:45,562
Driss!

1496
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:48,523
Driss!

1497
01:46:51,496 --> 01:46:53,862
What's this all about?

1498
01:47:13,727 --> 01:47:14,842
Hello, Philippe.

1499
01:47:55,686 --> 01:47:58,553
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo
now lives in Morocco.

1500
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:02,143
He has remarried
and has two young daughters.

1501
01:48:05,696 --> 01:48:11,282
Abdel Sellou has his own firm.
He is married, with three children.
