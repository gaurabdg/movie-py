00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:50,400
The Reader

2
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,030
You didn't wake me.

3
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,070
You were sleeping.

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,365
You can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,630
I've boiled you an egg. See?
I'd hardly have boiled you an egg

6
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,460
if I didn't want to see you.
Um, tea or coffee?

7
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,585
Does any woman
ever stay long enough

8
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,210
to find out what the hell
goes on in your head?

9
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,920
What are you doing tonight?

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,925
I'm seeing my daughter.

11
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,680
Your daughter?
You've kept very quiet about her.

12
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,890
Have I?

13
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:42,350
Well, she's been abroad for a year.

14
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
Did you say tea?

15
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,730
I'm going.

16
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,610
Have fun with your daughter.

17
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,145
Tickets, please.

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,940
Tickets. Excuse me.

19
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,240
Tickets.

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,620
Tickets, please.

21
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,306
Oh!

22
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,766
Hey. Hey, you!

23
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,546
Your feet. Your feet.

24
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,067
Hey, kid.

25
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,903
Up.

26
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,366
It's all right.

27
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,212
There. Where do you live?

28
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,596
It's just up here.
I'll be fine now. Thank you.

29
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,683
Goodbye.

30
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,318
Look after yourself.

31
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,161
I'm worried about him.
He looks terrible.

32
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,664
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

33
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,666
- He does.
- I don't need a doctor.

34
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,043
- Good, then.
- Peter.

35
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,505
We're not going to argue about this.

36
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,010
Remind me.
How old are you, now?

37
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,761
Michael's 15.

38
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,681
[doctor] It's scarlet fever.

39
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,684
He'll be in bed
for several months, at least.

40
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,311
Complete isolation.

41
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,606
Emily, keep away. He's contagious.

42
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,277
Emily!

43
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,962
How are you feeling?

44
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,506
Better.

45
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,259
I meant to tell you...

46
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,137
...the day I got ill, a woman helped me.

47
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,056
She helped you?

48
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,558
Yes. She brought me home.

49
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,894
Do you have her address?

50
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,225
- [Michael] Hello?
- [woman] Yes?

51
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,295
I brought you these flowers
to say thank you.

52
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,589
Put them over there in the sink.

53
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,655
I would have come earlier,
I've been in bed three months.

54
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,951
- You are better now?
- Yes. Thank you.

55
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:19,498
- Have you always been weak?
- Oh, no. I've never been sick before.

56
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,794
It's incredibly boring.
There's nothing to do.

57
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,213
I couldn't even be bothered to read.

58
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,345
Well, thank you again.

59
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,016
Wait.

60
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,393
I'll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

61
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,691
Wait in the hall while I change.

62
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,528
There are two more buckets downstairs.

63
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,947
You can fill them and bring them up.

64
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,478
You look ridiculous.
Look at you, kid.

65
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,858
You can't go home like that.

66
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,324
Take off your clothes.
I'll run you a bath.

67
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,848
Do you always take
a bath in your trousers?

68
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,655
It's all right. I won't look.

69
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,182
I'll get you a towel.

70
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,996
So that's
why you came back.

71
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,640
You're so beautiful.

72
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,853
What are you talking about?

73
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,239
Look at me, kid.

74
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,951
Mm! Mm!

75
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,120
Slowly.

76
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,414
Slowly...

77
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,291
Shh.

78
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,495
You've inconvenienced your mother.

79
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,624
How many more times?
I've said I'm sorry.

80
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,918
- You scared her.
- I got lost, that's all.

81
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,337
That's why I was late.
Can I have some more?

82
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,839
How can anyone get lost
in their own hometown?

83
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,926
I meant to head for the castle,
I ended up at the field.

84
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,969
- Opposite directions.
- None of your business.

85
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,848
- He's lying.
- He's not lying.

86
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,600
Michael never lies.

87
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,856
I've decided I want
to go back to school tomorrow.

88
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,151
- The doctor says you need three weeks.
- Well, I'm going.

89
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,737
Peter?

90
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,711
- Hey!
- Ooh!

91
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,407
Like this?

92
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,492
That's right.

93
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,666
No, not so fast.

94
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,762
Ah!

95
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,058
It's all right.

96
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,102
Do it again.

97
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,982
Mm...

98
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,985
Oh!

99
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,878
What's your name?

100
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,756
- What?
- Your name.

101
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,053
- Why do you want to know?
- I've been here three times.

102
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:03,016
I want to know your name.
What's wrong with that?

103
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,227
Nothing, kid.

104
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,355
There's nothing wrong with that.

105
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,358
- It's Hanna.
- You look so suspicious.

106
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,614
- What's yours, kid?
- Michael.

107
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,159
Michael. Hmm.

108
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,495
So I'm with a Michael.

109
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,832
Hanna.

110
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,837
The notion of secrecy
is central to Western literature.

111
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,508
You may say the whole idea of character

112
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,845
is defined by people

113
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,681
holding specific information,

114
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,433
which, for various reasons,

115
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,396
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

116
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,899
they are determined not to disclose.

117
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,249
You never tell me
what you've been studying.

118
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,001
Studying?

119
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,462
At school.

120
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,970
- Do you learn languages?
- Yes.

121
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,975
- What languages?
- Latin.

122
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,900
Say something in Latin.

123
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,074
It's Horace.

124
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,535
It's wonderful.

125
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,663
Do you want some Greek?

126
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,893
It's beautiful.

127
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,479
How can you tell?

128
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,941
How do you know,
when you've no idea what it means?

129
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,363
What are you studying in German?

130
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,781
I'm studying a play.

131
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,536
By a writer called Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing. You heard of him?

132
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:33,208
The play's called Emilia Galotti.
You can read it.

133
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,877
I'd rather listen to you.

134
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,712
All right.

135
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,975
"Act One. Scene One.

136
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,269
one of the prince's chambers.

137
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,897
The Prince..."

138
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm not very good.

139
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,068
Go on.

140
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,907
"Complaints, nothing but complaints.

141
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:10,954
For goodness sake,
is there anything left but work?

142
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,290
Just imagine that
people actually envy us."

143
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,336
You're good at it, aren't you?

144
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,924
Good at what?

145
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,721
Reading.

146
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,435
What's funny?

147
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,981
I didn't think I was good at anything.

148
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,454
Whoo!

149
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,155
What are you doing?
What is this?

150
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,449
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

151
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,495
You didn't want to know me! You could
see I was in the first carriage!

152
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,998
- So why did you sit in the second?
- What did you think I was doing?

153
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,709
- Why did you think I was there?
- How should I know?

154
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,505
Now, I've been working.
I need a bath.

155
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,882
And I'd like to be by myself.

156
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,551
Would you please leave?!

157
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,350
I... I didn't mean to upset you.

158
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,856
You don't have the power to upset me.

159
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,066
You don't matter enough to upset me.

160
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,729
I don't know what to say.

161
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,317
I've never been with a woman before.

162
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,324
We've been together four weeks,

163
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,910
and I can't live without you.

164
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,371
I can't.

165
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,706
Even the thought of it kills me.

166
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,216
I sat in the second carriage
because I thought you might kiss me.

167
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,553
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

168
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,895
Is it true what you said?

169
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,772
That I don't matter to you?

170
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,246
Do you forgive me?

171
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,545
Do you love me?

172
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,525
- Do you have a book?
- Yes, I have.

173
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,402
I took one with me this morning.

174
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,282
- What is it?
- The Odyssey, by Homer.

175
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,200
It's my homework.

176
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,456
We're changing the order we do things.

177
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,376
Read to me first, kid.
Then we make love.

178
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,844
- [Michael] The Odyssey, by Homer.
- What's an odyssey?

179
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,763
A journey.
He sets out on a journey.

180
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:03,765
Good.

181
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,981
"Sing to me of the man, Muse
The man of twists and turns

182
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,318
Driven time and again off course
Once he had plundered

183
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,363
- The hallowed heights of Troy"
- Come here.

184
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,373
"He pressed
her hand to his lips.

185
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,043
She was dead.

186
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,505
Past all help, or need of it."

187
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,849
"I poked into the place a
ways, encountered a little open patch

188
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,395
as big as a bedroom,
all hung around with vines,

189
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,397
and found a man lying there asleep.

190
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:56,818
And, by jings, it was my old Jim.

191
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,363
'When you landed,
I reckoned I could catch up with you

192
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,242
on the land without having to shout
at you. But when I see that house,

193
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,077
I begin to go slow."' [laughs]

194
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,915
"Lady Chatterley
felt his naked flesh against her

195
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,210
as he came into her.

196
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,546
For a moment,
he was still inside her..."

197
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,631
This is disgusting.

198
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,385
Where did you get this?

199
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,304
- I borrowed it from someone at school.
- Oh...

200
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,223
You should be ashamed.

201
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,395
Go on.

202
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:37,608
"'Billions of bilious blue blistering
barnacles in a thundering typhoon!

203
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,279
It is water!' 'But what on earth
did you expect it to be?"'

204
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,616
- Whiskey.
- "'Whiskey, by thunder, whiskey!'

205
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,120
'Whiskey? Come now, captain,
you can't be serious."'

206
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,331
That's enough for today, kid.

207
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:56,169
I was wondering, do you think
you could get some time off?

208
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,796
Maybe we could go on a trip.

209
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:02,049
- What sort of trip?
- A cycling holiday.

210
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,093
Just two days.

211
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,100
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route.

212
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,770
Look. What do you think?

213
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,651
I think you like planning, don't you?

214
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,670
"I'm not frightened.

215
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,672
I'm not frightened of anything.

216
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,429
The more I suffer, the more I love.

217
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,265
Danger will only increase my love.

218
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,852
It will sharpen it.
It will give it spice.

219
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,397
I'll be the only angel you need.

220
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,277
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

221
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,031
Heaven will take you back
and look at you and say,

222
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,954
'Only one thing can make a soul
complete, and that thing is love."'

223
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,274
- Hello.
- Hello.

224
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,157
- [woman] Excuse me.
- Hello.

225
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,327
Do you know what you'd like?

226
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,916
- Um...
- What are you having?

227
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,878
- You order. I'll have what you have.
- OK.

228
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,589
Um...

229
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:09,594
Two frankfurters, two potato salads
and two beers, please.

230
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

231
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,108
- I hope your mother was happy.
- Thank you.

232
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,360
She enjoyed her meal very much.

233
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,377
Come on.

234
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,481
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

235
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,359
It's OK, kid.

236
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,028
I don't want to know.

237
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:03,184
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing a poem. About you.

238
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,106
- Can I hear it?
- It's not ready.

239
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,650
I'll read it to you one day.

240
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,646
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

241
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,023
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

242
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,942
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

243
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,028
- Hurry. You know what she's like.
- [Michael] See you later!

244
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,780
Good luck.

245
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,284
Please stand.

246
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,623
Please sit down.

247
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,213
The defendant, please.

248
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,434
They're coming.

249
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,401
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,237
- What did she say?
- [teacher] Good morning, ladies.

251
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:24,450
Welcome your new fellow-students.
Treat them with courtesy.

252
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,244
- Sit down.
- Hello.

253
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,916
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

254
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,918
The Odyssey.

255
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,836
Take our your books.

256
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,967
Everyone believes
Homer's subject is homecoming.

257
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,054
In fact, The Odyssey
is a book about a journey.

258
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,932
Home is a place you dream of.

259
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:52,102
Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but
we're meant to study Homer, not Sophie.

260
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,447
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

261
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,032
It's gonna be a great summer.

262
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,007
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

263
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,344
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

264
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,896
Sorry I'm late.

265
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,942
I got held up at school.

266
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,654
I have a new book.

267
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,907
The Lady with a Little Dog.

268
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,786
By Anton Chekhov.

269
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,164
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

270
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,417
a lady with a little dog."

271
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,598
Schmitz, one moment, please.

272
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:17,146
I read the reports on you.
Every single one. Excellent work.

273
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,815
You'll be working in the office.

274
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,277
You got promoted. Congratulations.

275
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:34,413
- [boy] Yee-haw!
- Ah! [laughs]

276
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,707
Let's get out of here!

277
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,085
Come on! Michael, we're leaving.
Let's go!

278
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,295
Come on, Michael!

279
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,423
It's meant to be a surprise
for your birthday.

280
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,179
- [boy] Come on!
- [boy 2] What's the matter?

281
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,390
- I'm sorry. Really.
- [Sophie] We thought you'd like it.

282
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,684
We've got beer!
We're gonna dance!

283
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,770
I promised someone.

284
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,898
Michael, please!

285
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,656
"Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights,

286
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,117
on the bank quivered and trembled."

287
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,912
- [Hanna] Oh, kid, kid.
- What?

288
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,873
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

289
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,501
Nothing's wrong.

290
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,838
It's nothing.

291
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,344
You know, you never ask.

292
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,972
You never bother to ask how I am!

293
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,724
You never say.

294
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,852
It just happens to be my birthday.

295
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,440
It's my birthday, that's all!

296
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,400
You've never
even asked when it is.

297
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,153
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight!

298
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,824
- What's wrong with you?!
- What business is it of yours?!

299
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,285
It's always on your terms.
Everything.

300
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,080
We do what you want.
It's always what you want.

301
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,958
- My friends were giving me a party.
- Why are you here?

302
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,711
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

303
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,216
Mm! Mm!

304
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,322
It's always me
that has to apologize.

305
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,702
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

306
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,129
War and Peace, kid.

307
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,736
Now, you must go
back to your friends.

308
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Are you all right?

309
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,429
It's him.

310
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,519
Good.

311
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,896
Get the boy something to eat.

312
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,492
I think we all knew you'd
come back to us eventually.

313
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,731
Mr. Berg? It is 8:00.

314
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,566
Your daughter.

315
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,321
Thank you.

316
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,825
Julia.

317
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,997
- I've not kept you waiting?
- I was early.

318
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,291
Welcome back. [laughs]

319
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,172
So how will you decide?

320
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,050
I don't know.

321
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,010
I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

322
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,262
- You've seen your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,973
I wanted to get away. That's all.

324
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,476
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

325
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,020
Away from your parents?

326
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,316
I'm aware I was difficult.

327
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,986
I wasn't always open with you.

328
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,825
I'm not open with anyone.

329
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,917
I knew you were distant.

330
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:05,715
You know...
I always assumed it was my fault.

331
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,553
Julia.

332
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,388
How wrong can you be?

333
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,027
- [Julia] I'll see you very soon.
- [Michael] See you soon.

334
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,324
- [Julia] Good night, Dad.
- [Michael] Good night.

335
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,710
Those of you
for the special seminar group,

336
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,086
please stay on in this room.

337
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:43,920
please stay on in this room.

338
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,756
Professor Rohl will
be here in a moment.

339
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:22,292
Well, we seem
to be quite a small group.

340
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:26,087
A small group and a select one.

341
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,466
Clearly, this is going
to be a unique seminar.

342
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:34,095
We are going to start
with a reading list, gentlemen.

343
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,681
Karl Jaspers...

344
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:41,061
- And ladies.
- ...The Question of German Guilt.

345
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,622
So this is where you are.

346
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,248
Yes.

347
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,502
Come in.

348
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,341
- You take work seriously.
- I don't know.

349
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,843
You're rather a serious boy.

350
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,012
It's how I was brought up.

351
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,684
What about you? Are you serious?

352
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,022
You're sure you want to work tonight?

353
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,733
Yeah.

354
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,112
But I won't work every night.

355
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,823
See you tomorrow.

356
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,915
- Yes. Exactly
- That's right.

357
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,547
You need a hand.

358
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,576
- Why all the police?
- They're worried about demonstrators.

359
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,495
- For or against?
- Both.

360
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,461
Wow. It's a circus.

361
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,632
All rise.

362
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,596
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

363
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,808
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

364
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,814
First thing I'm going to do
is hear motions

365
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,108
from each of the defendants' lawyers.

366
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,987
They're arguing that there's
no reason to keep the defendants in jail

367
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,782
until the outcome
of the forthcoming trial.

368
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,493
- I'll take these cases one by one.
- Want a pen?

369
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,871
- I got a pen.
- [judge] Hanna Schmitz.

370
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,293
- Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
- [Hanna] Yes.

371
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,754
Can you speak louder please?

372
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,882
- [Hanna] My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- [judge] Thank you.

373
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:21,805
- You were born on October 21st, 1922?
- [Hanna] Yes.

374
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,681
At Hermannstadt.

375
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:28,102
- And you're now 43 years old?
- [Hanna] Yes.

376
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:33,274
- [judge] You joined the SS in 1943?
- Yes.

377
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,902
What was your
reason for joining?

378
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,740
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

379
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:41,908
Yes.

380
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,577
You'd recently
been offered a promotion.

381
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,496
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

382
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,833
- Objection.
- [judge] I'll re-phrase my question.

383
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,502
I'm trying to ascertain

384
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,672
if she joined the SS freely, hmm?

385
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,173
Of her own free will.

386
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,345
- I heard there were jobs.
- [judge] Go on.

387
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,223
I was working at Siemens

388
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,560
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

389
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:12,522
Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

390
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,192
They were looking for guards.

391
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:20,530
- I applied for a job.
- [judge] You worked first at Auschwitz?

392
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,867
- [Hanna] Yes.
- [judge] Until 1944.

393
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:28,538
Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Kraków?

394
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,206
- [Hanna] Yes.
- Are you OK?

395
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,042
- [judge] You helped move prisoners...
- I'm fine.

396
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,588
...west in the winter of 1944
in the so-called death marches?

397
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:01,529
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

398
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,741
It wasn't quite what I was expecting.

399
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:09,078
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

400
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,497
I thought it was exciting.

401
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,083
Exciting? Why?

402
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,586
Why did you think it was exciting?

403
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,421
Because it's justice.

404
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:53,164
Societies think they operate
by something called morality,

405
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,749
but they don't.

406
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,170
They operate by something called law.

407
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:04,884
You're not guilty of anything
merely by working at Auschwitz.

408
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,221
Eight thousand people
worked at Auschwitz.

409
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:13,810
Precisely 19 have been convicted,
and only six for murder.

410
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:18,815
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

411
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,733
That's the law.

412
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,529
The question is never was it wrong,

413
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,490
but was it legal.

414
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:32,328
And not by our laws, no.

415
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:36,499
- By the laws at the time.
- But isn't that...

416
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,085
- [Rohl] What?
- ...narrow?

417
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,047
Oh, yes. The law is narrow.

418
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,175
On the other hand,

419
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,721
I suspect people who kill other people

420
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:53,433
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

421
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,268
Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

422
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,938
Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

423
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,317
- Yes.
- Parts of it

424
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,862
have already been
read out in court.

425
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,531
It's by a survivor,

426
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,533
a prisoner who survived.

427
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,327
Ilana Mather.

428
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:16,039
She was in the camp
when she was a child, wasn't she?

429
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,833
- She was with her mother.
- [Hanna] Yes.

430
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:23,212
In the book,
she describes a selection process.

431
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:26,340
At the end of the month's labor,
every month,

432
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,469
sixty inmates were selected.

433
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:33,056
Picked out to be sent from
the satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

434
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,058
That's right, isn't it?

435
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,644
Yes, that's right.

436
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,106
And, so far,
each of your fellow defendants

437
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,984
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

438
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:49,030
Now, I'm going to ask you.

439
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,490
Were you part of it?

440
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,035
Yes.

441
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:01,209
So you helped make the selection?

442
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,295
- Yes.
- [judge] You admit that?

443
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,929
Then tell me,

444
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,431
how did that selection happen?

445
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:18,184
There were six guards,

446
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,897
so we decided we'd
choose ten people each.

447
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,110
That's how we did it every month.

448
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,445
We'd all choose ten.

449
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,240
Your fellow defendants
took part in the process?

450
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,076
We all did.

451
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,787
Even though they've denied it?

452
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,624
Saying "we," "we all"
is easier than saying "I," "I alone,"

453
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,376
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

454
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,047
Did you not realize

455
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,967
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

456
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:54,679
But they were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time.

457
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:59,475
So... the old ones had to make room
for the new ones.

458
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,230
- I'm not sure you understand...
- We couldn't keep everyone.

459
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,732
- There wasn't room.
- [judge] No.

460
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,735
But what I'm saying...

461
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,572
Let me rephrase.

462
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,491
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

463
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:20,163
"You, you and you have
to be sent back to be killed."

464
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,707
Well, what would you have done?

465
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,720
Should I never
have signed up at Siemens?

466
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:51,777
Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

467
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,782
Go, go. Go, go, go.

468
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,963
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

469
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:16,886
In your book, you describe
the process of selection.

470
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,554
Yes.

471
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,558
You were made to work and then,
when you were no longer any use to them,

472
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:26,062
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be killed.

473
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,023
Are there people here
who made that selection?

474
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,942
Yes.

475
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:36,489
I need you to identify them.
Can you please point them out?

476
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,878
Her.

477
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:55,758
And her.

478
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,762
Her.

479
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,141
And her.

480
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,062
Her.

481
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,857
And her.

482
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,362
Thank you. Please continue.

483
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,991
Each of the guards would choose
a certain number of women.

484
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,243
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

485
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,870
In what way differently?

486
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,711
She had favorites.

487
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,089
Girls, mostly young.

488
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,967
We all remarked on it.

489
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,262
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

490
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:45,933
In the evening,
she... she asked them to join her.

491
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,601
And we all thought...

492
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,688
Well, you can imagine
what we thought.

493
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:56,402
And then we found out she was making
these women read aloud to her.

494
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,240
They were reading to her.

495
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:06,996
At first, we thought this guard,
this guard is...

496
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,876
...more sensitive,
she's more human, she's kinder.

497
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:16,172
Often, she chose the weak, the sick.

498
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:21,218
She picked them out.
She seemed to be protecting them almost.

499
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,888
But then she dispatched them.

500
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,934
Is that kinder?

501
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:40,905
I want to
move on now to the march.

502
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:45,034
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

503
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:49,288
In the winter of 1944,
our camp was closed down.

504
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:54,377
We were told we had to move on.
But the plan kept changing every day.

505
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:58,214
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

506
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:02,885
Half of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

507
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,263
"Less a death march,
more a death gallop."

508
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:12,019
Please tell us about
the night in the church.

509
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:24,490
That night, we thought we were lucky
because we had a roof over our heads.

510
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,410
Go on.

511
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,579
We'd arrived in a village.

512
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:35,126
As always, the guards took the best
quarters. They took the priest's house.

513
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,671
But they let us sleep in a church.

514
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,258
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

515
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,510
The church was hit.

516
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,890
At first, we could only hear the fire.
It was in the steeple.

517
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,728
Then we could see burning beams...

518
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,899
...and they began to crash to the floor.

519
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,696
Everyone rushed...

520
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,075
...rushed to the doors.

521
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,956
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

522
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,377
The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

523
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,380
Is that right?

524
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,424
Nobody.

525
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,719
Even though you
were all burning to death?

526
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,932
How many people were killed?

527
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,060
Everyone was killed.

528
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,440
But you survived?

529
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,033
Thank you.

530
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,830
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

531
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,082
today to testify.

532
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,508
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

533
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,927
Don't you?

534
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,929
You tell us to think like lawyers,

535
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:14,058
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

536
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,519
- How so?
- This didn't happen to the Germans.

537
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,771
It happened to the Jews.

538
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,942
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

539
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,028
Six women locked 300 Jews in a church
and let them burn.

540
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,322
What is there to understand?

541
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:34,453
Tell me! I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

542
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,876
I started out believing in this trial.
I thought it was great.

543
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:44,296
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

544
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,216
Yes? Diversion from what?

545
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,302
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

546
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,639
you say, "They were the evil ones,
they were the guilty ones."

547
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,225
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

548
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,395
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else!

549
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,731
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

550
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,234
People go on about
how much did everyone know?

551
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:09,196
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew!

552
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:13,909
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question!

553
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,078
The question is,
"How'd you let this happen?"

554
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,290
Better, "Why didn't you
kill yourself when you found out?"

555
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:25,462
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

556
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,464
Everyone knew.

557
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,349
Look at that woman.

558
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:42,855
- Which woman?
- The woman you're always staring at.

559
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,398
I'm sorry, but you are.

560
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,326
I don't know which woman you mean.

561
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,662
You know what I'd do?

562
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,793
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myself.

563
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,007
Shoot them all!

564
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,893
Why did you
not unlock the doors?

565
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:10,103
Why did you not unlock the doors?

566
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,731
Why did you not unlock the doors?

567
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,946
I've asked all of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

568
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,492
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

569
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,290
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

570
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:35,337
The report which was written,
approved and signed by all of you

571
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,966
immediately after the event.
In the written report,

572
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:43,762
you all claim you didn't even know
about the fire until after it happened.

573
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:46,139
But that isn't true, is it?

574
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,934
Well?

575
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,603
It's not true.

576
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:59,736
- I don't know what you're asking.
- The first thing I'm asking

577
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,615
- is why didn't you unlock the doors?
- Obviously.

578
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,701
For the obvious reason.

579
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,996
- We couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

580
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,915
We were guards.

581
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,502
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

582
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:17,880
We couldn't just let them escape.

583
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,216
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be blamed,

584
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,719
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

585
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,888
- [Hanna] No!
- Well, then?

586
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:29,224
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

587
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,060
How could we have restored order?

588
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,272
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

589
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,525
The flames... There were flames
all over the village.

590
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,737
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

591
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:45,240
If they'd all come rushing out,
we couldn't just let them escape.

592
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:49,494
We couldn't.
We were responsible for them!

593
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:56,752
So you did know what was happening?
You did know? You made a choice.

594
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,546
You let them die,

595
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:02,299
rather than risk letting them escape.

596
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,597
The other defendants have made
an allegation against you.

597
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,432
Have you heard this allegation?

598
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,770
They say you were in charge.

599
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,856
It isn't true.
I was... I was just one of the guards.

600
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,400
- She was in charge.
- [woman] She was!

601
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,945
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

602
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:27,824
No. No. We all discussed what to say.
We all wrote it together.

603
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,160
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

604
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,620
- [judge] Is that true?
- No.

605
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,455
- Yes, you did!
- Does it matter?

606
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,666
- She wrote it.
- [judge] I need a sample

607
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,878
- of your handwriting.
- My...

608
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,297
- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to establish

609
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:45,550
- who wrote the report.
- I don't see how that's appropriate.

610
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,804
- 20 years have gone by.
- Take her paper. Approach the bench.

611
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,391
- Compare handwriting of 20 years...?
- [judge] Approach the bench.

612
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,898
I will not be overruled
in my own court.

613
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,192
I'm sorry...

614
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,535
I'd rather listen to you.

615
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:33,432
There's no need.

616
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,187
I wrote the report.

617
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:55,537
Silence, please.

618
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,956
Order!

619
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,180
You've been skipping seminars.

620
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:39,164
I have a piece of information.

621
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,125
Concerning one of the defendants.

622
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,212
- Something they're not admitting.
- What information?

623
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,014
You don't need me to tell you.

624
01:13:56,099 --> 01:14:01,186
It's perfectly clear. You have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the court.

625
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,023
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

626
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,442
It can help her case.

627
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:11,279
It may even affect the outcome,
certainly the sentencing.

628
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,784
- So?
- There's a problem.

629
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:19,871
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

630
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,794
- [Rohl] A moment, please.
- Sorry.

631
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,388
What are her reasons?

632
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,934
Because she's ashamed.

633
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,396
Ashamed of what?

634
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:53,530
- Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

635
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,992
Why "of course not?"

636
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,577
I can't.

637
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,831
I can't do that.

638
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,791
I can't talk to her.

639
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:09,838
What we feel isn't important.
It's utterly unimportant.

640
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,299
The only question is what we do.

641
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,972
If people like you don't learn
from what happened to people like me,

642
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:22,350
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

643
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:33,028
Schmitz?

644
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:35,322
You have a visitor.

645
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,503
Quiet, please!

646
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:53,715
Gertrud Ballow.

647
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,178
Andreas Michael Springer.

648
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,141
Michael Berg.

649
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,980
Walter Sherman.

650
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,993
Time's up.

651
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,181
Are you coming in?

652
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,234
You took your time.

653
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,800
What is it?

654
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,950
Where are you going?

655
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,577
I'm sorry.

656
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,538
I need to sleep by myself.

657
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,210
I'll just be a minute.

658
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,783
- Nazi!
- Nazi whore!

659
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:33,703
Nazi!

660
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:46,674
Silence in the court.
Silence in the court.

661
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,760
All rise.

662
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,019
The court
finds guilty the defendants

663
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,772
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

664
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,316
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva

665
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,652
and Andrea Lumen

666
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:10,657
of jointly aiding and abetting murder
in 300 cases.

667
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,576
The court finds guilty the defendant

668
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:18,331
Hanna Schmitz of murder in 300 cases.

669
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,713
The court sentences

670
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,883
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

671
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:33,721
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva
and Andrea Lumen

672
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:39,143
to each serve a total sentence in prison
of four years and three months.

673
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,521
Hanna Schmitz,

674
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,316
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

675
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,403
you're in a different category.

676
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:53,700
The court sentences the accused,
Schmitz, to imprisonment for life.

677
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,484
Where are we going?

678
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,487
I said I'll tell you when we get there.

679
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:36,200
- You told me you liked surprises.
- I like surprises.

680
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,179
She's grown, hasn't she?

681
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:01,726
I don't know. It's so long since
I saw her, Michael. How can I tell?

682
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:08,274
It's my fault.
We shouldn't have come unannounced.

683
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:11,527
Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

684
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,909
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

685
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,995
Julia knows.
We've already told her.

686
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,247
Gertrud and I,
we are getting a divorce.

687
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:27,377
You don't come for your father's
funeral, but you come for this?

688
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:31,839
It's not easy
for me to visit this town.

689
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:35,051
- Were you really so unhappy?
- That's not what I'm saying.

690
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,595
- It's not what I meant.
- Well, then?

691
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:44,310
You mustn't worry about Gertrud.
I'm going to look after her.

692
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:48,690
She's already a state prosecutor,
so she earns far more than I do.

693
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,400
Michael...

694
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:55,029
...I'm not worried about Gertrud.

695
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,739
I'm worried about you.

696
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:45,663
"Sing to me of the Man, Muse

697

Number?

704
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,187
Open it.

705
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,916
Testing, testing.
One, two, three. Testing, testing.

The Odyssey by Homer.

01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,954
The Odyssey by Homer.

01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:07,597
"...to the house of death.
But they held fast in place,

713
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,765
hoping that others might still come.

714
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:13,269
Shades of famous heroes,
men who died in the old days

715
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,939
and ghosts of an even older age,
I long to see."

716
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:21,068
"Come, sheathe your sword,
let's go to bed together.

717
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:24,572
Mount my bed and mix
in the magic work of love.

718
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,241
We'll breed deep trust between us."

719
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:33,748
"Not for all the world, not until
you consent to swear, goddess,

720
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:38,920
a blinding oath you'll never
plot some new intrigue to harm me."

721
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:42,757
"Straightaway, she began
to swear the oath that I required.

722
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,926
Never, she would never do me harm.

723
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,428
And when she'd finished then, at last,

724
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:51,098
I mounted Circes' gorgeous bed."

725
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:56,187
"When young Dawn, with her
rose-red fingers shone once more,

726
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,022
they yoked their pair again,

727
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,733
and out through the gates
and echoing colonnade,

728
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,986
they whipped the team
to a run and on they flew,

729
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:08,616
holding nothing back, and the princes
reached the wheatlands..."

"...those purebred stallions...

731
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:14,789
...as the sun sank..."

01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,291
"...is my beginning."

"Truly, and I have to confess,
I am jealous.

"Perfectly astonishing.
I've always said it was all tricks,

sleep under my very eyes."

"He lifted a large newspaper
from the table

738
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:35,476
and began stamping his feet
and flourishing the newspaper

01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,188
to drive Gregor back into his room."
"Zhivago... even a cake,

01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:43,109
rather like a Baba au Rhum
known as a Zhivago bun.

741
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:46,445
At one time you only had to say
to your sleigh driver in Moscow,

742
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,156
'Zhivago's.' And,
rather as if you had said..."

01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:59,208
"The Lady with the Little Dog
by Anton Chekhov."

745
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:04,797
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

746
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,466
a lady with a little dog.

747
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,845
Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov
had already spent two weeks in Yalta,

748
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:14,515
so he was bored with it
and always looking for fresh faces."

749
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,393
Sitting in the pavilion at Vernet,

750
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,187
he saw a young woman
walking on the seafront.

751
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:24,108
A fair-haired young lady
of medium height, wearing a beret..."

752

I want to take out a book.

753
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,415
Which book?

754
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,594
Do you have
The Lady with the Little Dog?

755
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,638
What's your name?

756
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,185
Hanna Schmitz.

757
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,510
The Lady with the Little Dog.

758
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,806
The Lady with the Little Dog.

01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,018
...Dog.

One, two, three, four, five, six.

761
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:57,118
The Lady with the Little Dog.

762
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:58,869
The...

763
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,333
The.

764
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,546
The. The. The.

765
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,756
The.

766
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:18,264
The.

767
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,625
- No letter?
- No letter. Sign.

768
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:59,800
- [woman on phone] You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

769
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,430
Thank you for calling me.
You got my letter?

770
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:06,056
I have it here.

771
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:10,060
As I say, Hanna Schmitz
is coming up for release very soon.

772
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:14,189
Hanna has been in prison
for over 20 years.

773
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,316
She has no family.

774
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,277
She has no friends.

775
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,821
You're her only contact.

776
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,158
And I'm told you don't visit her.

777
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:25,951
No, I don't.

778
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:28,370
When she gets out,
she's going to need a job.

779
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:30,831
She's going to need somewhere to live.

780
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:35,210
You can't imagine how frightening
the modern world will seem to her.

781
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,715
Mm-hmm.

782
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,012
I have no one else to ask.

783
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:49,266
If you don't take
responsibility for her,

784
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:51,977
then Hanna has no future at all.

785
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,566
It's kind of you.

786
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,943
Thank you for letting me know.

787
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,489
- You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

788
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,533
I'm Louisa Brenner. Good morning.

789
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:51,036
- How do you do?
- We were expecting you earlier.

790
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:55,207
I should warn you, for a long time
Hanna held herself together.

791
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:59,294
She was very purposeful. In the
last few years, she's different.

792
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,588
She's let herself go.

793
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:07,678
I'm taking you straight to the canteen.

794
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,181
They've just finished their lunch.

795
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:25,195
Table four.

796
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,035
You've grown up, kid.

797
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,384
I've got a friend who's a tailor.

798
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:33,931
He'll give you a job.

799
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:39,269
And I've found you somewhere to live.
It's a nice place.

800
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:40,938
Quite small, but it's nice.

801
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:44,942
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

802
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:51,823
There are various social programs,
cultural stuff I can sign you up for.

803
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,618
And the public library is very close.

804
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:02,376
You read a lot?

805
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,965
I prefer being read to.

806
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,471
That's over now, isn't it?

807
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:26,233
Did you get married?

808
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:29,403
I did. Yes, I did.

809
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,572
We have a daughter.

810
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:35,075
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

811
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,661
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

812
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,999
The marriage didn't last.

813
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,891
Have you spent time
thinking about the past?

814
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:03,770
- You mean with you?
- No.

815
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:07,566
No, I didn't mean with me.

816
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:20,787
Before the trial,
I never thought about the past.

817
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:23,040
I never had to.

818
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:25,375
Now?

819
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,086
What do you feel now?

820
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,174
It doesn't matter what I feel.

821
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,302
It doesn't matter what I think.

822
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,222
The dead are still dead.

823
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,649
I wasn't sure what you'd learned.

824
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:52,569
Well, I have learned, kid.

825
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:55,072
I've learned to read.

826
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,545
I'll pick you up next week, OK?

827
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,890
That sounds a good plan.

828
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,188
We can do it quietly,
or we can make a fuss.

829
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,148
Quietly.

830
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,403
OK. Quietly.

831
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:38,990
Quietly.

832
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:51,628
- Take care, kid.
- You, too. See you next week.

833
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:06,847
I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

834
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:14,020
Please. Please, take a seat.

835
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:41,923
She didn't pack.

836
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:44,301
She never intended to leave.

837
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:53,518
"The talk was that a new face

838
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:57,188
had appeared on the promenade,

839
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,983
a lady with a little dog."

840
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:08,700
She left me a message.

841
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,495
A sort of will.

842
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:17,500
I'll read the bit that concerns you.

843
01:44:25,301 --> 01:44:28,261
"There is money in the old tea tin.

844
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:31,097
Give it to Michael Berg.

845
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:35,852
He should send it,
alongside the 7,000 Marks in the bank,

846
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:39,731
to the daughter who survived the fire.

847
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,942
It's for her.

848
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:45,070
She should decide what to do with it.

849
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:51,409
And tell Michael I said hello."

850
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:12,073
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

851
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:14,868
- You're Michael Berg.
- Yes.

852
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,870
I was expecting you.

853
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:21,916
- Please.
- Thank you.

854
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:26,463
So you must tell me, exactly what
brings you to the United States?

855
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:29,632
I was here already.
I was at a conference in Boston.

856
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:31,009
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

857
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:36,139
I was intrigued by your letter,
but I can't say I wholly understood it.

858
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:40,226
- You attended the trial?
- Yes. Almost 20 years ago.

859
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:46,149
I was a law student. I remember you.
I remember your mother very clearly.

860
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:50,070
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

861
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,573
I... I'm sorry.

862
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,575
Go on, please.

863
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:59,329
Perhaps you heard.

864
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:04,209
Hanna Schmitz recently died.
She killed herself.

865
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,003
She was a friend of yours?

866
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:09,964
A kind of friend.

867
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,510
It's as simple as this.

868
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:17,931
Hanna was illiterate
for the greater part of her life.

869
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:21,184
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

870
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:25,146
- No.
- Or an excuse?

871
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:27,357
No. No.

872
01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:34,114
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

873
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:36,866
I sent her tapes.

874
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:43,373
She had always liked...
being read to.

875
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,966
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

876
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,094
At least start that way.

877
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,805
What was the nature
of your friendship?

878
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,563
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

879
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,362
I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.

880
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:16,614
And...

881
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:18,825
...even if I could,
I'm not willing to.

882
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:21,536
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

883
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:24,873
The affair only lasted a summer.
But...

884
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:28,585
But what?

885
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,134
I see.

886
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:43,099
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge
the effect she'd had on your life?

887
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:48,188
She'd done much worse
to other people.

888
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:54,861
I've never told anyone.

889
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,493
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

890
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:05,288
But the camps weren't therapy.

891
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:10,126
What do you think these places were,
universities?

892
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:14,380
We didn't go there to learn.

893
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:18,509
One becomes very clear
about these things.

894
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:24,641
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

895
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:27,477
Or do you just want
to feel better yourself?

896
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:31,397
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. Please.

897
01:49:31,482 --> 01:49:33,358
Go to literature.

898
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:36,653
Don't go to the camps.

899
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:40,657
Nothing comes out of the camps.

900
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,203
Nothing.

901
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:00,343
What she wanted...

902
01:50:01,262 --> 01:50:05,682
What she wanted was
to leave you her money.

903
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,601
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

904
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,438
As you think fit.

905
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,034
Here.

906
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:38,381
When I was a little girl,
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

907
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:42,760
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

908
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:48,891
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stolen.

909
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:52,478
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

910
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:56,649
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas

911
01:50:56,734 --> 01:51:00,653
my father had taken me to.
It wasn't stolen for its contents.

912
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:04,615
It was the tin itself

913
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:07,327
that was valuable,

914
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:09,078
what you could do with it.

915
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:20,173
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

916
01:51:20,257 --> 01:51:23,676
I give it to anything associated
with extermination of Jews,

917
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:26,346
then to me it seems...

918
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,766
...like absolution, and that's
something I'm neither willing

919
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:33,561
- nor in a position to grant.
- I was thinking maybe

920
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:37,523
an organization to encourage literacy.

921
01:51:41,362 --> 01:51:43,863
Good. Good.

922
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:46,824
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

923
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:48,659
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

924
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:52,372
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

925
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:55,541
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

926
01:51:57,378 --> 01:52:00,630
Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.

927
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:18,815
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

928
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:22,318
As you think fit.

929
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:29,409
I'll keep the tin.

930
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:35,998
Thank you.

931
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:32,638
- Where are we going?
- I thought you liked surprises.

932
01:53:32,725 --> 01:53:35,850
I do. I do like surprises.

933
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:42,915
Hanna Schmitz.

934
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:48,340
Who was she?

935
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,300
That's what I wanted to tell you.

936
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,600
That's why we're here.

937
01:55:05,775 --> 01:55:07,360
So tell me.

938
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,495
I was 15.

939
01:55:24,085 --> 01:55:26,625
I was coming home from school.

940
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,500
I was feeling ill.

941
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,840
And a woman helped me.

941
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:18,000
