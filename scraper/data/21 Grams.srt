1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,970
Check, please.

2
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,260
Look, Daddy, a volcano.

3
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,470
It's very pretty.
Now drink up your volcano.

4
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,640
All right. We're going. Mommy's waiting.

5
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Daddy, please. Just one more minute.

6
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,980
- No. We're going.
- No.

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,270
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,860
No.

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,780
Until I ended up
flatlining at the hospital.

10
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,660
But I survived. And instead of
letting that scare me,

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,080
I kept on going.

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
Until...

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,460
my first daughter was born.

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,750
And now, I look at my girls...

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,960
and my husband,

16
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,180
who has been standing by me for so long.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,430
Think which one you're going to pull out.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,060
- I always think, man.
- No, you don't.

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,690
They didn't lock you up this time
because you're not 18 yet.

20
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,980
Next time, they're going to
lock you up, brother.

21
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,360
Come on.

22
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,370
Well, you're not thinking.

23
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,910
Stealing might get you money,

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,170
you can tap
some cheerleader's ass,

25
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,750
you can show off riding
in some pickle-colored Thunderbird,

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,170
but tell me what's going to happen
if you shoot a pregnant woman
or an old man, huh?

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,680
You know what'll happen?

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
The guilt will suck you down to the bone.

29
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Stealing isn't worth it.

30
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,530
Going to church, reading the Bible...

31
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,540
and believing in Jesus, brother,
that's your ticket.

32
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,080
Yeah.

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,090
You think it's a fantasy, right?

34
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,050
Huh?

35
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,180
Come here, man. Get up. Come here.

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,770
See that truck? Beauty, isn't it?

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,570
I won it at a friend's raffle.

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,030
- No shit.
- No shit. You know what?

39
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,780
It wasn't luck. It was Jesus who wanted
me to have that truck.

40
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,240
That's bullshit. I bet you stole it.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,580
Jesus gave me that truck.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,960
And as He who gives
and He who takes away.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,250
Yeah, right.
He doesn't give a shit about us.

44
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,880
Come back. Come back.

45
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,890
Take off the hat.

46
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,060
Take off that hat.

47
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,190
God even knows when a single hair moves
on your head.

48
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,150
You're wrong, Nick.

49
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,060
So, this is death's waiting room.

50
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,190
These ridiculous tubes.

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,530
These needles swelling my arms.

52
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,370
What am I doing in this pre-corpse club?

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,080
What do I have to do with them?

54
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,750
I don't know when
anything began anymore...

55
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,170
or when it's going to end.

56
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,390
Who will be the first to lose his life?

57
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,980
He, in the coma?

58
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Or me?

59
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,650
All right. You can get dressed now.

60
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,950
Your Fallopian tubes
are severely damaged.

61
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,370
It, uh, looks like you had
some kind of an infection...

62
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,420
that, uh, wasn't taken care of properly.

63
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,250
We can try surgery,
but I have to tell you, I think, uh,

64
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,880
the probabilities are pretty slim.

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,260
Look.

66
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,390
Excuse me for asking this, but it's
important that you tell me the truth.

67
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,640
Have you ever had an abortion?

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,480
- Yes.
- Any reason?

69
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,160
I had already separated from my husband
when I got pregnant,

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,910
- and I...
- No. I meant a medical reason.

71
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,790
- My husband's dying.
- I'm sorry?

72
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,960
Paul, my husband, he's dying,

73
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,380
and I want to have his baby.

74
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,550
We can operate then and hope you get
pregnant within three or four months.

75
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,890
He's got one month left, at most.

76
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,440
- How'd it go?
- Not good, Reverend.

77
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,650
In one ear, out the other.

78
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,280
- Be patient.
- All it takes is one sheep
in a thousand, Jack. Come on.

79
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,620
Afternoon, Reverend.
Hey, Wolf, you still having
that birthday party Wednesday?

80
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,080
- My place, brother.
- Cool.

81
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,580
I may be late, Jack.
I have Bible class on Wednesday.

82
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,750
- Let it go.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
Here, hold this.

84
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,590
- I will hurt you, boy.
- Paul. Paul!

85
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,880
- ... Motherfucking dead!
Back off. Back off.

86
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,930
- I told you to think.
- Fuck you!

87
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,680
- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me, eh?
- Jack! Jack! Jack! Hey! Hey!

88
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,770
Hey, hey, Jack!
Come on! Come on!

89
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,320
Leave it, Jack. He's a kid, Jack.

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,780
- He's a punk, Reverend.
- No, he's a kid.

91
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,570
You think, Jack. You think.

92
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,880
'For those who are making decisions
that affect our life,

93
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,760
... we must call out to God
to give them His wisdom...'

94
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Daddy's home. I'll see you tomorrow, Tam.

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,180
I'll pick the boys up after school
if you want me to.

96
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,060
Daddy!

97
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,270
- Hello.
- Hey, babe.

98
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,350
How's my queen?

99
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,850
- And Hercules?
- You don't have a queen.

100
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Freddy, help me out.

101
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
- I got the cooler
from the religious center.
- Good.

102
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,150
- Dad, are we going to go buy a dog now?
- Help me out.

103
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,860
Freddy, we agreed no dogs.
Grab the other handle. Lift it up.

104
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,870
You said if I got good grades,
you'd buy me one.

105
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,450
Your sister has allergies,
and dog hair is bad for her.

106
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,950
Bad for her, not me. Get me a dog.

107
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,670
- Freddy, leave it alone.
- Well, at least get me a hamster.

108
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,250
- Well, we'll see.
- We'll see.

109
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,460
You always say you promise.

110
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,450
Hey, Wolf. You back, motherfucker?

111
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,290
Lock down six!

112
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,880
Six down!

113
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,770
Whoo! I win.

114
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,270
Age before beauty.

115
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,650
You're such a sore loser.

116
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,450
- Do you want to go to the Jacuzzi
for a while?
- Shit.

117
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,370
No, I can't. Michael and the girls
are waiting for me already.

118
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,370
Okay.
Well, call me later.

119
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,460
I'll call you.

120
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,380
Cristina?

121
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,760
And you get away from leading
your family like a man of God...

122
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,470
ought to lead his family in prayer...

123
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,270
and reading the word of God
and the things of God...

124
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,690
- and bringing them to the house of God,
- Amen.

125
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,770
Then you're opening the door for the
devil to come in and slay your family.

126
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,570
- Amen.
- Jesus is our light.

127
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,320
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our hope.

128
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,570
- Jesus is our hope.
- Jesus is our forgiveness.

129
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,580
Jesus is our forgiveness.

130
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,290
Jesus is the water
that quenches my thirst.

131
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,080
Jesus is the water
that quenches my thirst.

132
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,880
If you're saved
and you know it, say "Amen."

133
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,460
- Amen.
- Everybody up on your feet.

134
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,760
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light.

135
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,610
Hey, honey, I'm home.

136
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,970
- Hi.
- Jesus, you scared me.

137
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,350
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great.

138
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,060
Have you been smoking again?

139
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,860
Oh, for fuck's sake, Paul.

140
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,230
You know if they find out
you're smoking, they'll take you
off the transplant list.

141
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,780
If I don't smoke, I'll go fucking nuts.

142
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,280
Better nuts than dead.

143
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,870
Is that necessary?

144
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,620
I don't know how the hell you get them.

145
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,750
Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!

146
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,760
Baby! Oh, God!

147
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Call an ambulance!

148
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,260
Baby!

149
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,560
Call a fucking ambulance! Goddamn it!

150
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,690
Please, do something.

151
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,780
Baby!

152
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,570
Come on, please.

153
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,820
Hey, Al, you want a Coke?

154
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,280
Jack, boss wants to talk to you.
He wants to see you now.

155
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,580
Come on. We both know
I'm not a caddie yet,

156
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,000
but I'm working at it.

157
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,750
And I'm learning, Brown.

158
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,460
Man, I swear to God,
I'm not going to let you down.

159
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,680
- No, Jack, that's not the problem.
- What's the problem?

160
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,970
The problem is some members have started
complaining about your tattoos.

161
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,350
- I got a long-sleeved shirt.
- No, man... No long-sleeved shirt...

162
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,680
- You can't see it.
- Is going to cover that one
on your neck right there.

163
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,270
You're going to start wearing a scarf.

164
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,610
Look, Jack. This club is for people
different from me and you.

165
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,360
No. You know, I don't drink.
I don't steal.

166
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,740
I'm clean. Tell me, why me?

167
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,700
Look, I know you're clean.
That's why I hired you.

168
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,830
But this decision
comes from the administration.

169
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,910
And if I don't follow through,
they're going to fuck me too.

170
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,840
Look, I cut you a hefty severance check,

171
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,550
and you can pick it up
on the way to the cashier's.

172
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,470
Try to understand.

173
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,390
Okay. Good. So, is there any pain?

174
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,390
My head hurts a little bit.

175
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,680
That's normal. That's because of the
blood pressure medicine.

176
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,850
We'll get you something else
to make you feel better.

177
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,480
- Thank you.
- I brought...

178
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,030
- ...what you asked for.
- Oh, my God.

179
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,780
Oh. Is that my heart?

180
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,790
The culprit.

181
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,720
Which one is he?

182
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,730
That's him with the brown vest.

183
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,360
He's putting the bag up on top right now.

184
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,790
You okay?

185
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,340
Come here.

186
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,980
I want to kill him.

187
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,520
We have to kill him.

188
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,610
Thank you, Lord, for keeping us together,

189
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,780
for filling us with love
and for giving us this meal.

190
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,570
- Amen.
- Amen.

191
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,170
I got fired from the club today.

192
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,920
Because of your good pal Brown, right?

193
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,550
- He had nothing to do with it.
- It's mine!

194
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,550
- You believe that, Jack?
- Yes, I do.

195
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,560
- Ow!
- Freddy, stop it.

196
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,350
- Mommy, Freddy hit me in the arm.
- Which arm, baby?

197
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
- This one.
- Jack, don't start.

198
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,480
Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.

199
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,240
- Give me it!
- Jack, no!

200
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,780
Hold it out.

201
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,660
Whoever slaps you on the right cheek,
turn the other to him also.

202
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,370
Hit her. Don't be afraid.

203
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,870
- Jack, no!
- Hit her!

204
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,590
Isn't that great. Wonderful.
Great parenting, Jack.

205
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,720
Good job. It's okay. Shh.

206
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,550
He didn't hurt her.

207
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
There's no hitting in this house.

208
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,110
You understand?

209
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
Get in the corner!

210
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,880
Do I put the chocolate chips
in now, Mommy?

211
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,090
That's right, honey, and then stir.

212
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,760
Stir really quick.

213
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,970
Laura, put that back. Come on.

214
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,890
- When is Daddy coming?
- Soon. Now let's
get this finished, honey.

215
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,270
- Mmm!
- None for you.

216
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,730
Mmm!

217
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,730
No, Laura, stop it now.

218
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,150
Next Friday, ask Lupe to stay the night.

219
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,070
I can't stay, because I invited the
company managers over for dinner.

220
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,450
I fired her.

221
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,580
What, you fired her? Why?

222
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,290
She made me feel like a cripple.

223
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,960
Oh, goddamn it, Paul.

224
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,170
So, now who's going to cook for you?

225
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,170
Who's going to clean up after you?
Who's going to take care of you?

226
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,130
Who?
I can do it for myself.

227
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh, you can do it by yourself?

228
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,680
I can't do it anymore, Paul.

229
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,770
Really, I can't.

230
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,450
What are you doing?

231
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,170
I'm just... What?
What does it feel like I'm doing?

232
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,380
Don't. Don't. You might hurt yourself.

233
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,170
I'm not going to hurt myself.
Besides, I need you to...

234
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,760
- Huh?
- I went to a fertility clinic.

235
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,260
Oh good, more doctors. Mary, I can't
have this discussion again.

236
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,770
No, this is a... this is a specialist.

237
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,350
He said that with surgery,
I might get pregnant.

238
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,850
- You need to donate sperm and then...
- Mary, no.

239
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,980
I could take care of him.

240
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,570
But I can't. So what's the point?

241
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,990
This is what I most want in the world.

242
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,660
Do it for me, please.

243
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,260
This'll be $58.95.

244
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,060
Thank you.

245
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,990
Did you find everything you need, sir?

246
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,370
I'll have, uh...

247
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,660
Oh, you know what? I left my wallet.

248
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,850
It's going to be hot.

249
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,190
Great.

250
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,570
When does my brother plan to show up?

251
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,280
He said he'll be back by six.

252
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,370
One hundred percent pure golden lager.

253
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,080
Are you out of your mind?

254
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,460
- Pretty much.
- Oh, it's warm.

255
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,790
- Okay, well, hey, if you want to
drink lemonade all night...
- No, no, no, no.

256
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,750
Just give it here. Give me...

257
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,390
Katie? Laura?

258
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,890
Where are you guys?

259
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,780
"To repeat the message, press one.
To delete it..."

260
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,290
Hi, sweetheart, it's Dad. I was hoping
we could have lunch one day next week.

261
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,290
Give me a call.

262
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,290
Hi, honey. I'm on my way home.

263
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,250
- If you need me to pick up
anything along the way...
- Look, Daddy, a pigeon!

264
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,760
Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.

265
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,260
Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

266
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,180
To send a message, press...

267
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,570
Hello.

268
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,860
Speaking.

269
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,670
What?

270
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Where?

271
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,980
Stay here. I'll be right back.

272
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,070
Now, Mary, you understand that even if
the operation is successful,

273
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,860
artificial insemination
doesn't always work.

274
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,160
It doesn't matter. We want to try.

275
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Paul?

276
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,170
Yeah.

277
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,670
Now, Paul, um...

278
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,680
This is about having a child

279
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,050
And with your condition,

280
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,270
you know you probably
won't ever meet him.

281
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,690
Mm-hmm. Well, life goes on, right?

282
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,690
Yeah, right.

283
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,780
I'd like you to put on one of these
gloves to avoid contaminating the sample.

284
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,160
And, uh, try to make it
all land in the receptacle.

285
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,790
When you're done, just leave it in here.

286
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,750
In case you need a little inspiration.

287
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,550
Hey, big boy, what are you doing?

288
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,680
- Oh, yeah, you ready to party?
- Yeah, well, I'm here now.

289
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,690
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

290
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,940
Oh, there you go!

291
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,280
Good, come on. Come on!

292
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,960
Dr. Swann, call the operator.

293
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,970
Excuse me. My husband and daughters
were in an accident,

294
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,970
- ...and I was told to come here.
- What were their names?

295
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,260
Michael, Catherine and Laura Peck.

296
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,260
Okay.

297
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Excuse me for a minute.

298
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,070
- Cris?
- What happened, sweetheart?

299
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,070
I don't know.
They haven't told me anything yet.

300
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,820
- It's going to be all right.
- Yeah, everything will be okay.
Don't worry.

301
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,250
Okay, what is the most important
question for safe sex?

302
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,670
What time does your husband get home?

303
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,970
That's good, huh? Yeah.

304
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,970
His Highness has arrived.

305
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,690
Let's see what he comes up with.

306
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Serve up that chili.

307
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,780
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

308
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,620
It's 7:00. What are you going
to make up this time... traffic?

309
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,960
You preaching the word? The entire
congregation has been waiting for you.

310
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,260
It's your party, remember?What's wrong?

311
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,260
Have you been drinking?

312
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,140
- No.
- You didn't drink again, did you?

313
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,850
I just ran over a man and two girls.

314
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,780
You're lying, right?

315
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,410
I was driving home...

316
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,870
Took a turn...

317
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
a little too quickly,

318
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
I didn't see them crossing.

319
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,370
Can't you go any faster?

320
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,880
Baby, hold on.

321
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,760
I love you.

322
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,850
Deep breath.

323
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,060
Good.

324
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,280
- Your lungs are clear.
- I got a question for you.

325
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,280
- Yeah.
- Whose heart do I have?

326
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,820
Uh, I can't tell you.
It's hospital regulations.

327
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,790
Just like the donor's family
doesn't know your name either.

328
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,080
- But you know.
- Yes.

329
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,880
This is your heart now. That's all that
should matter to you.

330
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
- I want to know who saved my life.
- If you want, you can write...

331
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,590
an anonymous letter to the family
through the donor's association.

332
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,050
Personally, I think it's better
that you don't know.

333
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,360
Mrs. Peck? I'm Dr. Jones.

334
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,360
- What happened to my family?
- Please, sit down.

335
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,160
No, I... I'm okay. What happened?

336
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,790
Well, your husband and your daughters
were hit by a car,...

337
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,080
... and we had to perform emergency
surgery on your husband.

338
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,960
Your husband suffered multiple
skull fractures,

339
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,590
and we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain.

340
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,760
He's in critical condition,
and we're concerned that he's
showing low brain activity.

341
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,260
What? Is he going to be all right?

342
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,390
We're doing the best we can.

343
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,350
And what about my daughters?

344
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,320
Your youngest daughter
was brought in with severe bleeding.

345
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,990
She just wasn't able to
get here in time.

346
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,410
I'm very sorry. They...
They both died in the accident.

347
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,380
No.

348
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,590
No. Oh, my... Oh! Oh! Oh!

349
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,380
Oh, my God!

350
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,060
No! Oh, my God!

351
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,770
Do... Oh!

352
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,270
Wh... Where are they?

353
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,280
Where... Where are they?

354
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,360
Mrs. Peck, your girls are here, and you
can see them if you like, but...

355
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,870
- I want to see them.
- Mrs. Peck, I wouldn't recommend it.

356
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,080
Oh, God, Daddy. Oh, Daddy!

357
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,750
I'm very sorry. If you'll excuse us,

358
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,460
we have to get back to Mr. Peck.

359
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Uh, I'm very sorry.

360
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,640
Oh, God! Oh!

361
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,190
We want dinner!

362
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,980
Marianne, we'd like some dinner in here!

363
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,820
Tell Reverend John to stay. Make sure no
one notices and get everyone to leave.

364
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,740
- What happened?
- Trish, just do what I tell you!

365
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,910
Okay, baby. It's going to be okay.

366
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,170
- It's going to be okay.
- Yeah.

367
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,880
Come on. Start the truck up.

368
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,380
Start the truck up.
Pull it in. Come on, baby.

369
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,250
Hey, Jack.

370
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,760
What are you doing here, man?

371
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,470
Just came to pick up my things, Brown.

372
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,980
Why don't you let me
buy you a couple of beers?

373
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,770
I don't drink, Brown.

374
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,980
How about a Diet Coke?

375
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,780
You know, I've been talking to a buddy
of mine about hooking you up with a job.

376
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,320
I've been telling him all about you.

377
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,870
So, what do you say, huh? I've been
feeling shitty about what went down.

378
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,870
- Come on.
- I understand.

379
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
So, what do you say?

380
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,460
As you know, the doctors did everything
they could to save your husband's life,

381
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,550
but he has shown no brain activity.

382
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,180
We're here to help you with some of the
final decisions that need to be made.

383
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,480
We have a patient...

384
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,560
...who is gravely ill.

385
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,270
I'm here to give you some information
on organ donation.

386
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,490
Are you willing for your husband to
donate his heart?

387
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,860
- Can we discuss this another time?
- I'm afraid not.

388
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,120
I can give you time to discuss it,
but this is a decision that needs to
be made soon.

389
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,080
Paul?

390
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,370
Paul, the beeper.

391
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,470
It's the hospital.

392
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,550
I think they've got a heart.

393
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,730
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on
behalf of Mr. Paul Rivers.

394
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,980
Yes.

395
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,650
Okay. Yes, I understand.

396
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,740
Where do I have to take him?

397
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,270
Good luck, my love.

398
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,380
Hello.

399
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,550
Hello.

400
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,270
Does your shoulder bother you?

401
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,480
- Why?
- Because I was watching you swim before,

402
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,940
and you have a wide stroke.

403
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,940
If you bring it in tighter,
you get a better glide.

404
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,570
Thanks for the advice.

405
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,450
Do you mind if I join you?

406
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,790
- Actually, I was just leaving.
- Here you go.

407
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,960
Maybe just until you finish?

408
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,880
No. Maybe next time.

409
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,980
Did you know that eating alone can cause
kidney damage? And that's bad.

410
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,490
Well... Okay, sorry.

411
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,310
Hello?

412
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,270
Hello, is Ana there?

413
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,270
What?

414
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,650
- Is Ana there?
- Hang on a sec.

415
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,360
Ana. Ana!

416
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,360
Telephone.

417
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,450
Hello.

418
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,870
Hello?

419
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,380
Who was that?

420
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,970
Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me know.

421
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,770
Look, Daddy, a pigeon!
Girls, no, don't touch!

422
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,060
Laura, stop it.
Give me a call on my cell.

423
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,480
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

424
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,760
Did you go?

425
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,980
Are they dead?

426
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,860
I'm going to turn myself in.

427
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,030
John says nobody saw you. Nobody.

428
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,450
They don't know the license plate
or what kind of car. Some asshole
even swears it was a cab.

429
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,080
Marianne, what would you do
if these were our children? Tell me.

430
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,080
But they're not. It didn't happen to us.

431
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,960
No, it didn't happen to us.

432
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,420
It happened to me.

433
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,820
What the fuck do you gain
by turning yourself in?

434
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,820
It's my duty, Marianne.

435
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,280
No, Jack, your duty is here with us.

436
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,280
With your family.

437
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,450
My duty's to God.

438
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,380
Please. Marianne,

439
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,670
Get out of my way.

440
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,960
Jack!

441
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,480
- Oh, buddy, right there!
- Yes!

442
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
My turn.

443
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,860
I think I better go back to the hospital.

444
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,410
- Hey, he deserves it.
- I thought your doctor said
you're not supposed to eat that.

445
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,660
I'm making up for lost time.

446
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,960
Lost time, not lost pounds.

447
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,170
We're going to have to
send you back for liposuction.

448
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,760
Well, here's to all those
who didn't think I was going to die.

449
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,050
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!

450
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,550
- To the first day of my new life.
- Congratulations.

451
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,260
- Cheers.
- It's good to have you home, man.

452
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,980
I knew you'd make it. I told you.

453
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,350
I also have an announcement to make.

454
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,070
I wanted to tell you that Paul and I
are going to be parents.

455
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,570
- That's great!
- There's a scary thought...
Paul being a parent.

456
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,030
- You kept this real quiet.
- Have you told your parents yet?

457
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,780
We're going to be parents.
We just don't know when yet.

458
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:10,870
I'm going to have an operation,
and then we're going to try
artificial insemination.

459
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,590
Terrific. Terrific.
Artificial insemination, huh?

460
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,300
Professor, do your female students know
you no longer have lead in your pencil?

461
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,470
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh! Come on!

462
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,180
Play nice!

463
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,890
Come on, let's pass the cake around.
Cut me a piece about half that size.

464
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,270
I can't wait to hear about this.

465
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,370
- Mr. Donneaud?
- Mr. Rivers?

466
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,370
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.

467
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,380
Sorry I couldn't cancel this
appointment, but the way I'm bowling
today, I probably should have.

468
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,380
Have a seat here. Park it right there.

469
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,670
Can I bring you something to eat?

470
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,260
- I'm not hungry.
- Honey, you need to eat something.

471
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,390
I'm fine, Dad.

472
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,480
When your mother died,
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

473
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,570
I felt the world was falling on me and
that I was never going to get up.

474
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,320
But, sweetie, life goes on.

475
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,790
You know what I thought when Mom died?

476
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:19,670
I couldn't understand
how you could talk to people again.

477
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,170
How you could laugh... again.

478
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,970
I couldn't understand
how you could play with us.

479
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,560
And no... no, that's a lie.

480
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,270
Life does not just go on.

481
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,120
Louise is getting fat, don't you think?

482
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,120
She's done nothing but eat
since Robert left her.

483
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,750
What? She looks okay to you?

484
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,960
Why did you tell everybody
we're having a baby?

485
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,970
I wanted to share our plans with them.

486
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,050
Oh. That's what I mean,
they're our plans.

487
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,270
Why does everyone have to
know our private life?

488
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,560
Why the fuss?
They're our best friends.

489
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,190
Yeah, but we haven't
even talked about it.

490
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,270
Oh, we haven't?
I thought this was more than settled.

491
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,740
Things change, Mary.

492
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,280
Something we have to think about.

493
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,280
I don't have anything to think about.

494
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,830
I've already made my decision.

495
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,080
Would you help me with the glasses?

496
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,390
So young.

497
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
You want me to stay with you tonight?

498
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,350
I'm okay. Thanks.

499
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,690
I just want to be alone.

500
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,620
Cris...

501
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,620
The police called.

502
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,090
They said you need to
go and press charges.

503
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,460
I'll go with you if you want.

504
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,180
I'm not going to do anything.

505
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,680
Y... This guy was... was some ex-con.

506
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,770
Are you really going to let him
just walk the streets?

507
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,770
What do you want me to do?

508
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,480
Well, he ran over
Michael and your daughters.

509
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,070
Nothing I can do
is going to bring them back.

510
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,490
Do you get that?

511
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,420
Hey, how are you doing?

512
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,880
- You found it okay?
- Yeah, I did.

513
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,590
The donor's name was Michael Peck.
He was 37 years old.

514
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,050
An architect and married.

515
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,550
This is the authorization
for transplant signed by
his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.

516
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,770
I have a copy of the medical report
if you care to see it.

517
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,850
And I also have the widow's
phone number and address
just in case you're interested.

518
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,190
How did Michael Peck die?

519
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,490
You might have seen it in the newspaper.

520
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,570
This guy named Jack Jordan ran over Mr.
Peck and his two little girls...

521
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,450
October 10th at 6:50 PM.

522
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,290
This Jack Jordan's a piece of work. He's
been in and out of jail since he was 16.

523
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,460
Car thief, small-time crook, drugs,

524
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,380
bad checks, alcoholism.

525
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,050
Last time he was in jail
has only been a few years ago.

526
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,470
You feeling okay, Mr. Rivers?

527
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,560
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

528
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,730
- Okay, I just, um...
- You want some water?

529
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,360
He was, uh, an architect.

530
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,160
What's the point in getting involved?

531
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,830
Mary, I want to know who I am now.

532
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,920
I don't think that's the way to do it.

533
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,920
What is then?

534
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,260
Look for it with me.

535
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,680
Let's look ahead together, not behind.

536
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:55,860
Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday and
you didn't even have one drink with me.

537
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,860
Why don't you come over to my place?
I'm having a party.

538
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,870
Yeah, I bet they're all
as boring as you are.

539
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,780
You'd be surprised. No, man, I'll pass.

540
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,790
Listen, I'll call you later
about that job, okay?

541
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,790
All right, man. All right.

542
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,960
Thank you.

543
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,170
Hey, Brown, you should.

544
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,170
I will.

545
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,170
Okay, now, we can schedule
the surgery, um,

546
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,170
I could get you in as early as Monday.

547
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,880
- Yeah.
- 9:00 AM.?

548
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,680
What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?

549
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,970
Well, I can't offer you
a real number on that.

550
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,850
Um, you know, there's the damage
from the abortion...

551
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,850
that wasn't handled properly...
the blockage...

552
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,270
What abortion?

553
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,270
What abortion, Mary?

554
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,360
- I can explain.
- Explain what?

555
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,780
- There is an explanation.
- Uh-huh.

556
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,580
All that drama
about artificial insemination.

557
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,790
Kids' names.

558
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,960
You got pictures of our friends
babies all over the place.

559
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,960
Why?

560
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,460
So you can flush it
down the fucking toilet?

561
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,090
We've been a fraud for a long time, Mary.

562
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,470
Oh, yeah? Why didn't you tell me
that when you were sick, huh?

563
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,350
Or did you expect one of your girl-
friends to come and take care of you?

564
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,560
You came back because you wanted to.
Don't blame me for that.

565
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,190
I came back to take care of you
because I love you.

566
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,980
Or because you were feeling lonely.

567
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

568
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,750
I can't keep going like this.

569
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,170
The insemination, the child.

570
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,550
It's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid
on something that's just been bled dry.

571
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,390
It's finished.

572
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:34,440
But it... it isn't finished if we give
it a chance and have this baby.

573
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,440
When we could have, you didn't want to.

574
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,860
- We were separated, goddamn it!
- It's different now!

575
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,450
Yes, it's different.

576
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,620
- We going to go?
- You only know how to think about
yourself.

577
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,460
Close six!

578
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,170
Well, thanks for finally seeing me.

579
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,680
They tell me you don't want to eat.

580
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,060
I'm not hungry.

581
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:19,150
Jack... Jesus didn't come
to free us from pain.

582
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,860
He came to give us
the strength to bear it.

583
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,490
Maybe He wanted this pain for me.

584
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,990
No, He had nothing to do with this.
It was an accident.

585
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,070
No, it wasn't an accident.

586
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,870
Jesus chose me for this.

587
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,330
Jack...

588
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,880
Ask for the mercy of Jesus Christ.

589
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,590
If it was an accident,

590
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,460
why do I have to ask for His mercy?

591
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,050
"I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy.

592
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,680
"I will have compassion
on whom I will have compassion.

593
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,560
- Don't be so prideful. That's a sin.
- "And the fearful and unbelieving.

594
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,680
- "And the abominable,
the murderers, the warmongers,
- Jack, listen to me.

595
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,190
"The sorcerers and the idolaters
and all liars...

596
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,860
- Jesus came to save us, not to damn us.
- "Shall have their part...

597
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,030
in the lake which burned
with fire and brimstone."

598
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,780
Revelation 21:8. Jesus, loves you.

599
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,570
But He also knows how to punish
arrogant sinners like you.

600
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,280
"As many as I love, I rebuke and chaste."
Revelation 3:19.

601
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,290
- Jesus betrayed me.
- Stop this shit, or you're
going straight to hell!

602
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,670
Hell?

603
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,380
This is hell. Right here!

604
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,670
You're damning your soul! You shut up now...

605
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,880
- ...and ask Christ to forgive you!
- Hey! Forgive me?

606
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,550
I did everything He asked me to do!
I changed!

607
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,260
I gave Him my life, and He betrayed me.

608
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,640
He put that fucking truck in my hands
so I could carry out His will.

609
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,640
Made me kill that man and those girls.

610
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,480
But hey, He didn't give me the strength
to stay and save them.

611
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,150
Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this!

612
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,160
God even knows when a single hair moves
on your head.

613
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,910
And you taught me that.

614
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,580
We're going to pray for you, Jack.

615
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,680
Good evening, sir.

616
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,530
Excuse me.

617
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,860
Hey, just like old times, huh?

618
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,570
How the hell have you been?

619
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,080
Did you end up marrying that hunk you
brought around here last time?

620
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,410
- Yep.
- Yeah?

621
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,170
Is he a good lay?
How they make us suffer, huh?

622
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,170
It's all right.
I got some great candy for you.

623
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:30,760
I got Special "K," angel dust.
I got your all-time favorite.

624
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,760
And I got the newest of the new... R2.

625
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,760
This shit is all the rage.
You take two of these,

626
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,270
- You go straight to heaven.
- I'm not into chemicals.

627
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:46,060
Cristi, you're not
a cuddly little kitty now, are you?

628
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,270
Look, if you don't like them,
you don't pay for them.

629
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,280
- That's my girl.
- It's busy.

630
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,120
Hey, go easy on the booze tonight, right?

631
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,740
What the fuck are you...?

632
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,160
What the fuck are you doing?

633
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,890
- Would you get my car, please?
- Sure.

634
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,180
- What do you care, asshole?
- I can get you a cab.

635
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,560
- I don't need a fucking taxi.
- Just give me the glass, ma'am.

636
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,350
Here's your fucking glass.

637
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,190
You okay?

638
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,360
Stupid fucking asshole, move your car!
I'm fine. Get away from my car!

639
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,990
There's no damage. I'm fine.
Get away from my car.

640
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,080
- There's no damage.
- Excuse me, I know her.
I can drive her home.

641
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:26,290
- Is this any of your business?
- I'm your friend Paul
from the sports club.

642
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,620
- Yeah, well...
- Remember?

643
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,380
Yeah. Well, can you tell these
assholes to get away from me?

644
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,670
I'll drive her home.
It's not a big deal, okay?

645
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,760
Okay. All right?
You can't drive like this.

646
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,260
What do you care?

647
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,060
You're going to get arrested.
Let me drive you.

648
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,060
Please?

649
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,570
Damn it.

650
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,600
I sold the truck to pay for the lawyer.

651
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,600
I didn't ask for a lawyer.

652
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,150
Marianne, I didn't ask for a lawyer.

653
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,610
You want your children to spend
another two years without you?

654
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,610
Is that what you want?

655
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,160
This is God's will. So be it.

656
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,910
Two years ago,
you didn't believe in anything.

657
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,200
Now everything has to do with God.

658
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,000
I think I preferred you
the way you were before.

659
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,300
I was a fucking pig before.
Is that what you prefer?

660
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,590
At least it was you.

661
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,300
Now I don't have the slightest
fucking idea who you are.

662
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:12,100
Life has to go on, Jack,
with or without God.

663
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,400
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

664
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,110
- Fine.
- Were you able to find anything out?

665
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,900
Jack Jordan's living in a cheap motel
lost out in the middle of nowhere.

666
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,910
Phone records.

667
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,410
One of his prison fishy pals
is from there.

668
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,990
- That was quick.
- Just a matter of checking the calls.

669
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,710
Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in.

670
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Here's a pretty recent photo of Jordan.

671
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,010
It was taken the last time he was in jail.

672
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,600
- Were you able to get that
other thing that I asked about?
- Mm-hmm.

673
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:43,690
This is a clean gun, no record.
They call this an "orphan."

674
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,190
It is loaded.

675
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Careful there, Hoss.

676
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,410
You don't have to cock it.
Just pull the trigger to shoot it.
This releases the cylinder.

677
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,210
I think we're set to go.
That's all I want to know.

678
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,790
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

679
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,060
Ma'am, it's been an hour since I called.

680
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,900
46, St. Vincent Street.

681
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:30,070
Thank you.

682
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:36,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

683
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,500
Some rain.

684
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:49,000
- Do you not have your car?
- No, but my taxi will be here
in a minute.

685
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,010
I'm right over here.
I'll give you a lift if you like.

686
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,300
No. Thanks.

687
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,850
I'm the guy who drove
your car home last week.

688
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,110
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

689
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,400
I left my jacket with you.

690
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:21,200
I'm sorry. I'll bring it by tomorrow.

691
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,710
Are Sure I can't give you a ride?
I'm right here.

692
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,710
Or do you want to swim?

693
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,710
Okay.

694
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,410
Hello.

695
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,600
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

696
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,690
Let me just give you my cell phone
number so you can have it.

697
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,910
Would you have lunch with me tomorrow?

698
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,210
What for?

699
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:53,000
Uh, you're going to have to eat
at some point, and I'm very worried
about those kidneys.

700
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:58,970
Come on. Lawrence's, 2:00.
It's very nearby.

701
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,060
- Please.
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

702
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,060
Great.

703
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,900
... we have construction on the ramp
coming from southbound 240 at Summer.

704
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,700
That ramp is closed until 6:00 PM. Use
Arlington Pike as an alternate. Also...

705
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,700
Forty at the new bridge,
they have the center lane closed.

706
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,000
Use southbound l-20 as an alternate.
Safe Driving believes so strongly
in minimum coverage.

707
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
They're easy, fast, affordable and reliable.
They're serious about minimum coverage.

708
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,710
1-800-SAFE-DRIVING.
Minimum coverage is the best option...

709
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,510
Look, Daddy, a pigeon! Daddy, look!

710
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,510
Girls, no, don't.
Don't touch it. Laura, stop it.

711
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,100
Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

712
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,390
Good night, Mr. Peck.

713
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:54,860
- Hey, Lucio, don't forget
to do my garden on Saturday.
- No, sir, I won't forget.

714
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
Son of a bitch. What...?

715
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,900
Leave it to me, Marianne.

716
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:42,010
Sometimes it happens, sometimes it
doesn't. Everybody reacts differently.

717
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,800
That's why you've been vomiting so much.

718
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,510
So, what are you saying,
I've got to change medication?

719
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,970
Okay, I'm going to
be frank with you, Paul.

720
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:56,060
The heart that you're carrying
is going to give out soon.

721
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,110
I need you to stay in the hospital
until I can find you another heart.

722
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,700
- You want me to wait for a new heart.
- We don't have another choice.

723
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:13,700
I can't do that. I can't wait for
someone else to die, locked up
in a fucking room.

724
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:19,210
- I can't... I can't do it.
- Y... You're dangerously close
to heart failure, Paul.

725
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:23,800
You might die a lot sooner
than you think.

726
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:34,390
Let me ask you something, and I want you
to be really honest with me, okay?

727
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
If I stay...

728
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:43,400
will I be saved?

729
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,860
I can't guarantee it.

730
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,110
But if you don't
come back to the hospital,

731
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,950
you're condemning yourself
to a terrible death.

732
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:55,000
Your heart won't work anymore.
You'll die, asphyxiated.

733
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,870
It's an awful death, Paul.
You can't imagine it.

734
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,710
- At least here we could help you to...
- You can help me die better.

735
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,670
That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better.

736
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,470
Well, I'm not going to do that, okay?
I'd rather die outside.

737
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:17,310
I'm not going to do it again.

738
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,190
How much did the lawyer charge?

739
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,410
- Marianne, how much did the fucking
lawyer charge?
- Enough.

740
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,990
How much is enough, Marianne?

741
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,210
Enough so your children can
remember your fucking face.

742
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:42,710
You keep asking stupid questions,
I'm getting out at the next corner.

743
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,810
Hi, guys. We're home.

744
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,110
Daddy! Daddy! What'd you bring us?

745
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:07,110
I brought you a kiss.

746
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:11,360
- You didn't bring me a present, huh?
- No, just a kiss.

747
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,200
- We made you a cake.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

748
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,910
Freddy put the icing on it.

749
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,500
Freddy, are you going to
say hello to your father?

750
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,710
Freddy drew those for you.

751
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,170
I drew those ones.

752
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,800
- Mommy made the cake.
- Come here.

753
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,600
- Come look at the cake, Daddy.
- She did?

754
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,910
Come on, Daddy.

755
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:59,240
There is a number hidden in every act of
life, in every aspect of the universe.

756
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:03,870
Fractals, matter... that there's a
number screaming to tell us something.

757
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,510
- Am I boring you?
- No. No. I...

758
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,630
I'm sorry.

759
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:15,800
I guess I try to tell them
that numbers are a door...

760
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,770
to understanding a mystery
that's bigger than us.

761
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:24,600
How two people, strangers, come to meet.

762
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,610
There's a poem by
a Venezuelan writer that begins...

763
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:35,110
"The earth turned to bring us closer.

764
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,200
"It turned on itself and in us...

765
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,410
until it finally brought us
together in this dream."

766
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,290
That's beautiful.

767
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:54,510
There's so many things that have to
happen for two people to meet and...

768
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,300
Anyway, that's...
that's what mathematics are.

769
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,100
How long have you been swimming?

770
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,310
Oh, for years.

771
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:12,110
- It doesn't bore you?
- No. It's what makes me feel normal.

772
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:16,410
If I didn't swim or walk or do something,
I think I'd go crazy.

773
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,080
Thanks for lunch.

774
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,490
Yeah. Bye.

775
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,830
- Do you want to come in?
- No.

776
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,000
Thanks... Yes, I do want to come in.

777
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,370
Hey, can I ask you...

778
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,210
- Huh?
- Okay, I have a gun. Okay?

779
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,330
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me. I'll shoot...

780
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,710
- I don't have any money.
- Turn around. Turn around. I'll shoot
you. Just turn around. Go.

781
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,670
- I don't have any...
- Walk. Walk. Walk!

782
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,180
- P... Put them up! Put your hands up!
- Why?

783
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,510
- Wait.
- Just walk. Go!

784
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,100
We're going to go down that
path right there. Do what I say
and then you won't get hurt.

785
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,770
- I don't have any...
- Go!

786
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:15,110
I'm not looking. Come on. Keep walking.
Go right down here.

787
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,110
Just keep walking. Keep walk...
I said don't look at me.
I'll shoot you in the head.

788
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,860
Keep your hands up! Walk! Over here.

789
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,580
Over here. Hey!
Come on, don't look at me.

790
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,200
Okay, keep going! Stop! Stop!

791
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,500
Right... Okay, uh... Stop!

792
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:34,710
T... Turn around.
But keep your hands on your head.
Keep your hands on your head!

793
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,510
G...Get-Get... Take your shoes off
and get down on your knees.

794
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,510
Uh, take off your shoes.

795
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,260
No, not that... not that one.
J... Just get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

796
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,470
Sir, please.

797
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,900
You shouldn't have done it.

798
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,780
Done what?

799
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,110
You shouldn't have done it!

800
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:05,070
Close your goddamn eyes!

801
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,210
- She looked me in the eyes.
- What are you talking about?

802
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,300
One of the girls that I killed,

803
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,510
she looked me in the eye.

804
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,970
She wanted to tell me something.

805
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:17,600
I just... I left her there.

806
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,910
I ran away.

807
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:32,410
I ran away. I ran away.

808
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:37,880
- I ran away. I ran away.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

809
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,600
- You sticking with red?
- Sure.

810
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,970
Are you okay?

811
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,100
Yeah.

812
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,400
I, um...

813
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:47,570
Sorry. I, uh... Dizzy.

814
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,660
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?

815
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,910
I think I should go home.

816
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,080
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

817
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,300
I like you a lot, Cristina.

818
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:12,180
It's been a long time since
I liked someone so much.

819
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,810
Can I see you again?

820
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:22,810
I'm a married woman.

821
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,900
I figured.

822
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:37,410
- Thanks.
- Good-bye.

823
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:06,770
Everybody!

824
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,470
- Look, Daddy. These are the zebras,
these are the lions.
- Very pretty, Gina.

825
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,600
- How could you draw a zoo if you've
never been to one?
- I've seen them in...

826
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,770
Stop fighting.

827
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:47,860
The lawyer called to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday.

828
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,610
- If you want, I'll go with you
to the church again.
- Daddy, in school they said...

829
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,860
you killed two girls and their daddy.

830
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:59,700
- Is that true?
- Yes.

831
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:03,210
- No.
- Yes.

832
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,880
- He killed them.
- It was an accident, sweetie.

833
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,300
You understand?

834
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,810
Oh, Jesus, every time
I look at my children...

835
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,410
Hello?

836
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:43,410
- Hello?
- Paul?

837
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,210
Wh... Who is this?

838
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,380
Cristina.

839
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,010
Did I wake you?

840
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,140
Hang on a second.

841
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,980
Hi.

842
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,810
- Did I wake you?
- No, that's okay.

843
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:16,110
Um, c... could you come to my house?

844
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,580
- Is something wrong?
- No, I just...

845
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,910
I just want you to come if you can.

846
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:29,500
Or if you want to.

847
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,710
Yeah. I'll be right there.

848
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,510
- Thanks.
- Okay.

849
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:44,470
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Who are you talking to?

850
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:47,480
I won't be long.

851
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,810
Where are you going?

852
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:53,610
- I said I won't be long.
- Exactly where and with who are
you going?

853
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,400
I thought you'd change
after the transplants.

854
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:02,200
And I thought you'd change
if I did. Neither of us changed.

855
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,000
- What's wrong?
- He's been shot in the chest.

856
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,880
- Come on.
- Shot in the... in the chest.

857
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,180
- He's been shot in the chest.
- Come on.

858
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,010
- Okay, how long has he been like that?
- He's dying, okay? We need a...

859
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,680
Okay, I'll go get a stretcher.

860
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:10,980
- Ma'am, he'll...
he'll be right back.
- It's okay.

861
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:14,310
Hang in there, baby. I shot him.

862
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,110
- You did what?
- I shot him.

863
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,900
Patrol, I need you to call the police.

864
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,910
It's an emergency, yes.
I'm right out front.

865
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,380
Hi.

866
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,510
Are you okay?

867
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:50,470
Cristina?

868
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,480
You kept me thinking all day.

869
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:01,780
You see, I haven't spoken
to anyone in months,

870
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,280
and, uh, I barely know you...

871
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,530
and I already need to talk to you.

872
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,410
And...

873
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:18,380
there's something the more I think
about, the less I understand.

874
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,510
Why the hell did you tell me
that you liked me?

875
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:30,180
Answer me, because I didn't
like you saying that at all.

876
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,480
You can't just walk up to a woman you
barely know and tell her you like her.

877
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,770
You-You can't. You can't do that.

878
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:42,280
You don't know what she's going through.

879
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
Or what she's feeling.

880
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:50,580
I'm not married.

881
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:53,080
- I...
- Come here.

882
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,710
It's okay.

883
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,710
- I'm sorry.
- No.

884
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:37,870
Cristina, wait.

885
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,170
- I have to tell you something.
- Okay.

886
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,880
- I have to tell you something.
- Please, kiss me.

887
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,210
Wait. Cristina. I...

888
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,130
Cristina.

889
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,180
I have Michael's heart.

890
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,970
- What...
- I have Michael's heart.

891
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,560
You understand what I'm saying?

892
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,610
It was transplanted into me at St.
Francis Hospital on October 11.

893
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,570
No. No.

894
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:11,070
I tried to tell you.
I just didn't know how to tell you.

895
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,080
- How dare you. How dare you!
- Cristina...

896
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,700
- How fucking dare you!
- I'm here for a reason.

897
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,080
Get out of my house!

898
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,710
- Cristina...
- Don't touch me!

899
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:25,210
Get out of my house now!
You make me sick!

900
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,380
I had a reason. Can't you see that?

901
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:30,800
You get out of my fucking...
Get the fuck out of my house! Okay.

902
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,010
You make me sick!

903
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,180
Get out!

904
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,080
Good morning.

905
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,510
Why did you look for me?

906
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,980
Because I needed to.

907
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,980
I don't want your fucking pity.

908
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:09,780
That wasn't it.

909
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,040
I was sick, Cristina. I was very sick.

910
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:27,380
I was dying when Michael
gave me his heart.

911
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,380
He saved my life.

912
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:43,480
I tried in every way that
I knew how to find out...

913
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,310
who had given me this heart.

914
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:50,270
And that's how I found out how
he and your daughters had died.

915
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:59,410
And it's very painful for me
to know how I got this heart.

916
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,910
And I couldn't sleep.

917
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,830
I just... I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to help in some way.

918
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,840
I just want to thank you for...

919
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,890
But I couldn't find you.

920
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:25,180
And then I saw you...

921
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,270
That day.

922
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:33,280
And now I can't be away from you.

923
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
I can't.

924
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,210
You don't have to be afraid.

925
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:54,210
I've got a good heart.

926
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:13,070
I'm scared too.

927
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:05,890
-
Why did you leave us, Jack? Why?
- I am where I have to be.

928
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:09,680
- Gina got really sick because
of the hamster. Jack, we need you...
- The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.

929
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:16,270
Back when I was mean,
about the decisions I make,

930
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,770
- that's my mirror.
- Just come back, please.

931
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,610
- That's my mirror.
- Jack, it doesn't matter.

932
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:25,780
- And I have to live with them
alone. Alone.
- Just come back to us, Jack.

933
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:30,290
- And I can't erase it.
No one can erase it.
- Your family needs you.

934
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,910
Jack...

935
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:43,170
We need to stabilize him before
we can get him to the hospital.

936
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:47,720
But right now what we really need
are units of B-positive blood.

937
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,010
I... I'm O-positive. Will that work?

938
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:52,980
Okay, open and close your fist
several times.

939
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:41,580
Unit 35, go ahead.

940
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:49,380
Okay, pal, you're free to go
for lack of evidence.

941
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:56,010
Your story doesn't check out
and contradicts our investigation...

942
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:00,270
and the statements made by
Mrs. Peck and Mr. Rivers.

943
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,980
I just need you to sign here.

944
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:05,980
What if I really am guilty?

945
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,490
Yeah, well, it happens.

946
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,610
Won't be the first time,
won't be the last.

947
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:17,010
What are you doing?

948
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:21,480
You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?

949
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:25,480
Mary, I don't want to fight.
I want this to end well.

950
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:29,480
Oh, you think ending well means
disappearing for a few days?

951
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,950
You just waited till you got better
to tell me to fuck off.

952
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:36,070
- I'm going back to London.
- We can't keep doing this.

953
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:38,280
Really?

954
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,040
I'll have surgery and I'll be inseminated
with your child, with or without you.

955
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:45,710
- Mary, what for? Why?
- Because I want to.

956
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,710
- Well, I won't authorize that.
- No. Oh, no?

957
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,710
Well, you already have.

958
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,510
I have a signed copy of your
authorization to use your semen.

959
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:58,220
- Would you excuse me?
- I get what I want.
What do you gain? What do you gain?

960
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,890
You decide if you come
looking for me or not.

961
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:55,090
Hi, honey. I'm on my way home.

962
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:58,880
If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me...
Girls, no! Don't touch!

963
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,680
Laura, stop, it.
Give me a call on my cell.

964
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:04,890
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

965
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:08,480
To repeat the message, press one.
To delete, press two.

966
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:12,690
Hi, honey. I'm on my way home.

967
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:16,610
If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me...
Girls, no! Don't touch!

968
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,780
Laura, stop, it.

969
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:23,070
Give a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

970
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,370
I'm grilling some chicken.
You want anything to eat?

971
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:55,080
No. Thanks.

972
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:58,880
- I can make you a sandwich if you...
- No. No, no, no! No!

973
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,630
Cristina. Cristina. Listen to me.

974
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:07,390
You don't need that shit.
You don't need it.

975
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:10,010
Don't tell me what I need.

976
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,680
Katie could have lived.

977
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,480
What?

978
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,980
She'd be alive right now,
but that bastard left her there...

979
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,280
lying in the street.

980
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:13,790
He left the three of them
like animals. He didn't care.

981
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:20,040
At least she could be here with me.

982
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:26,130
That son of a bitch is walking
the streets, and I can't even
go into their room.

983
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,130
What do you mean
he's walking the street?

984
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,890
I want to kill him.

985
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:36,180
You want to kill him?

986
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:39,980
I'm going to kill Jack Jordan.
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.

987
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:42,480
Slow down. Wait. Just-Just slow down.

988
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:47,110
Slow down? Slow down
while I what? Huh? While I what?

989
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,280
Take it easy. Take it easy?

990
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,990
My husband and my little girls are dead
and I'm supposed to take it fucking easy?

991
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,750
I can't just go on with my life!

992
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:03,380
I am paralyzed here!
I am a fucking amputee, do you see that?

993
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:06,090
Who are you?

994
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:09,840
You owe it to Michael...
No, you've got his heart.

995
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:14,010
You're in his house fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair!

996
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,680
- We have to kill him!
- No, we... Not like this. Not like this.

997
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,180
Then how? Tell me how!

998
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:43,880
Katie died with red shoelaces on.

999
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:48,090
She hated red shoelaces.

1000
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:53,640
And she kept asking me
to get her some blue ones,

1001
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,010
and I never got her the blue ones.

1002
01:47:57,890 --> 01:48:02,190
She was wearing those fucking
red shoelaces when she was killed.

1003
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:20,080
Oh, God.

1004
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:25,580
You shouldn't have done it!
Close your... Close your goddamn eyes!

1005
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:33,090
Oh.

1006
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:38,010
You... murderer.

1007
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:40,890
You just let them
lie there on the street.

1008
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:43,980
Those two little girls,
you just let them die like dogs.

1009
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:46,190
I should have killed you.

1010
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:52,780
Now you disappear. Don't even go back to
the motel and get your things.

1011
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:55,490
Just disappear.

1012
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:38,490
- Mrs. Peck.
- How is he?

1013
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:42,080
We weren't able to use
your blood for his transfusion.

1014
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:47,750
We found very high levels
of illegal substances in your blood.
You're taking very high risks here.

1015
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:53,210
Well, that's my problem.
In your state, I suggest
you stop using these substances.

1016
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:57,090
- What are you talking about?
- You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.

1017
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:06,980
- You sure?
- You really need to start taking care
of yourself, Mrs. Peck.

1018
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:10,690
We'll let you know when
Mr. Rivers is out of the O.R.

1019
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:05,490
Where were you?

1020
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:12,580
Did you kill him? Did you?

1021
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:24,680
Why didn't you wake me up?

1022
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:29,390
Where's the body?

1023
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:33,690
Nobody will ever find the body.

1024
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,890
I'm sorry.

1025
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:08,680
We're going to go home now.

1026
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:12,190
Let's just get out of here, okay? Yeah?

1027
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:15,310
You okay?

1028
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:18,190
It's okay, baby. Just lie down.

1029
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:25,280
- Need rest. I need to rest.
- I know. I know.

1030
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:30,750
I'm sorry.

1031
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,750
I love you.

1032
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:41,090
I love you.

1033
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:43,090
Oh.

1034
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:13,080
Wake up.

1035
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,790
Hmm? Hmm?

1036
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:18,090
There's somebody outside.

1037
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,240
Oh, my God!

1038
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:56,790
- Oh, my God!
- You want to kill me?

1039
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:59,880
- What's he doing here?
- Here I am.

1040
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:02,800
Shoot me.

1041
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:06,680
Go ahead. Kill him. Paul.

1042
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,680
Oh, my God!

1043
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:11,890
Do something!

1044
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:00,190
Oh.

1045
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,190
Oh, baby. Oh, no.

1046
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:06,280
No. No. Oh, my God.

1047
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:11,780
Baby. Baby. Baby. Oh, my God. Oh.

1048
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,580
Baby. Oh, my God.

1049
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:18,000
Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby.

1050
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,750
Baby. Oh!

1051
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:23,090
Oh, God! Call an ambulance.

1052
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:30,090
Call a fucking ambulance!

1053
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,990
How many lives do we live?

1054
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,450
How many times do we die?

1055
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,300
They say we all lose 21 grams...

1056
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:11,630
at the exact moment of our death.

1057
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:13,640
Everyone.

1058
01:56:15,890 --> 01:56:19,980
And how much fits into 21 grams?

1059
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,480
How much is lost?

1060
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:39,490
When do we lose 21 grams?

1061
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,600
How much goes with them?

1062
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:13,280
How much is gained?

1063
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,040
How much is gained?

1064
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,600
21 grams.

1065
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:44,390
The weight of a stack of five nickels.

1066
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,690
The weight of a hummingbird.

1067
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,980
A chocolate bar.

1068
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:55,200
How much did 21 grams weigh?

1069
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:21,470
To Maria Eladia.

1070
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:26,340
And when loss was burnt,
the maize fields became green again
