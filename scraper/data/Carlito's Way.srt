1
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,750
Somebody's pullin' me close to the ground.

2
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,450
I can sense, but I can't see.

3
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,850
I ain't panicked. I been here before.

4
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,950
Same as when I got popped
on 104th Street.

5
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,948
Don't take me to no hospital, please.

6
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,749
Fuckin' emergency rooms
don't save nobody.

7
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:13,549
Son of a bitches always pop you
at midnight...

8
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,249
...when all they got is a Chinese intern
with a dull spoon.

9
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,149
Look at these suckers scramblin' around.
What for?

10
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,449
My Puerto Rican ass ain't supposed
to have made it this far.

11
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,249
Most of my crew got washed
a long time ago.

12
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,648
Don't worry. My heart, it don't ever quit.

13
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,048
I ain't ready to check out.

14
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,748
Seems like I just got out of the joint.

15
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:01,148
Stood up in front of that judge,
and told him what was who.

16
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:07,448
Now I ain't sayin' that my way
would have been different...

17
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:11,947
...had my mother been alive when I was
a kid, 'cause that's all you hear in the joint.

18
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:15,947
"I didn't have a chance." No. Bullshit.

19
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:21,447
I was already a mean little bastard
while my mother was alive, and I know it.

20
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,347
But I learned about women from her.

21
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:27,247
Mr. Brigante, there are 56 cases
on the court's docket for this morning.

22
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:28,847
Why am I listening to this?

23
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,647
Your Honor, Mr. Brigante
is understandably excited...

24
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,747
...having been vindicated
after five years of incarceration.

25
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,647
There's no vindication here, counselor.

26
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,447
Or absolution, or benediction,
or anything...

27
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:42,347
...other than an incredible
convergence of circumstances...

28
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,846
...which you've exploited
to your client's benefit.

29
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,446
Your Honor, these circumstances
that you speak of...

30
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,346
...include illegal wiretaps
and tainted evidence.

31
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:53,546
This is a classic
"fruit of the poisoned tree" situation.

32
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,246
I think after five years
of unjust incarceration...

33
00:05:56,346 --> 00:06:00,346
...it's reasonable to request Mr. Brigante
be indulged his right to speak.

34
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:02,646
Okay, Mr. Brigante, I'm all ears.

35
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,046
Your Honor...

36
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,446
...with all due respect...

37
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:11,246
...past and present,
and without further to-do.

38
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:17,545
Let me assure this court that
I am through walkin' on the wild side.

39
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,645
That's all I've been tryin' to tell you.

40
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:25,345
I have been sick with the social ills
known in the ghetto...

41
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:30,545
...but my time in the sterling
correctional facilities...

42
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:35,445
...of Green Haven and Sing Sing
has not been in vain. I've been cured!

43
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,845
Born again, like the Watergaters.

44
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,545
I know you heard this rap before.
Your Honor, I mean it.

45
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,045
This is the truth. I changed.

46
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,844
I changed and it didn't take no 30 years...

47
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:52,244
...like Your Honor thought, but only five.

48
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:55,544
That's right, sir. Five years.

49
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:59,044
And look at me. Completely rehabilitated...

50
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:05,144
...reinvigorated, reassimilated,
and finally gonna be relocated.

51
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,644
And I want to thank
a lot of people for that.

52
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,444
I look over there and I see
that man there, Mr. Norwalk.

53
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:14,644
I want to thank you, sir,
for making the tapes in an illegal fashion.

54
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:21,043
I would like to thank the Court of Appeals
for reversing you, Your Honor.

55
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:23,243
And I want to thank...

56
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,643
...AImighty God, without whom
no case gets tossed.

57
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:31,743
- I can't believe this.
- I must have forgot. How could I forget...

58
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,343
...my dear, close friend and lawyer...

59
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:40,943
...David Kleinfeld,
who never gave up on me...

60
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,243
...through everything, thick and thin.

61
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:46,143
- Why don't you just stand up?
- I'm sorry.

62
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:49,143
- Mr. Brigante!
- Davey Kleinfeld.

63
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,643
You're not accepting an award.

64
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,942
Court of Appeals' decision...

65
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,442
...and the District Attorney's
unfortunate investigative techniques...

66
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:05,542
...now devolve upon me the painful duty
of unleashing upon society...

67
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:09,042
...a reputed assassin
and convicted purveyor of narcotics.

68
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:12,242
No. Never convicted on no dope.

69
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:17,142
The indictment is dismissed.
Prisoner is discharged. Call the next case.

70
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,042
- I'm indebted to you.
- Okay.

71
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:21,942
I feel like I won.

72
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,042
Excuse me. Congratulations.

73
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:30,441
- No hard feelings, right?
- I'll be seeing you, Brigante.

74
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:37,241
That was some line of crap
you handed him in there.

75
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:40,941
That was no line of crap, man.
I meant every word I said.

76
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:44,341
You don't understand. You don't get it.

77
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,341
I'm a free man,
and I don't mean just out of jail.

78
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:51,341
"I am free at last, free at last...

79
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:57,241
- "...thank God Almighty, I am free at last!"
- I gotta work here. Save your energy.

80
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,840
Wait till you see what I got
lined up for tonight.

81
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,440
So what are you gonna do for money?
Hook up with Rolando again?

82
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,540
I told you, I ain't goin' back to the street.

83
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,740
Twenty-five years I worked that sucker.

84
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,340
What do I got to show for it? Squat.

85
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,040
You dancing with me
or you dancing with him?

86
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,040
What does that mean,
"I ain't goin' back on the street"?

87
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,339
What else do you know how to do?

88
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,839
- I got plans, baby.
- Talk to me.

89
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:40,439
'Cause you can dance
with him if you wanna.

90
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,439
I know Dave since he was
just out of law school.

91
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,239
He was workin' as a clerk
for a big mob lawyer.

92
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,039
Kept a tire iron under the seat of his car,
tried like hell not to look scared...

93
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,239
...by all his wise guy clients.

94
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:59,139
But Davey Kleinfeld,
he ain't scared no more.

95
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,038
So look at you.

96
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,438
You really made something of your life.

97
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:10,838
You put me in business.
All my first clients came through you.

98
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,338
As I say, you know, top drawer.

99
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,638
You're top drawer, Davey.

100
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,538
Man.

101
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:22,138
Listen, I got something for you.
You remember Saso?

102
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,138
Saso. Yeah.

103
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,438
Fat guy, had the Argentine place
on Madison.

104
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:29,638
He bought the lease on this bankrupt disco.
Beautiful place.

105
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,938
I got some investors together
and we backed him.

106
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,938
I got $50,000 in the place.

107
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:37,537
Problem is Saso. He's been shakin' the till,
payin' off gambling debts.

108
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,737
He says he doesn't get $25,000,
he's gonna lose his lease.

109
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,337
I like the place. I go there sometimes.

110
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:46,037
The money's no big deal.
I don't mind puttin' it in...

111
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:50,337
...as long as I know there's someone there
who's gonna run the place straight, clean.

112
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:51,637
Me?

113
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:55,037
I owned clubs. I never ran 'em.

114
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:58,337
What's the big deal?
You step in, straighten things out...

115
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:01,237
...you take a salary, a chunk of the profits.
- Please.

116
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,537
You've done enough already for me.

117
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,937
You call it a favor between friends.

118
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,936
No favor. I owe you.

119
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,936
Favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet.

120
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,836
You saved my life.

121
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,836
You saved my life, Dave.

122
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:31,836
Thirty years. You know what that is?

123
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:36,636
I was dead. I was buried.
I was under the ground.

124
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,436
You dug me up.

125
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,435
I don't know what to say to you.

126
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:49,535
I just don't know what to say.

127
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,135
Say you love me.

128
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,035
I love you.

129
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:57,035
If you was a broad, I'd marry you.

130
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,135
- My boy.
- I bet you would.

131
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,835
Who's that? Well, you know...

132
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:06,735
Look, we're going to the ladies' room.

133
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,635
Goodbye, you two.

134
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,035
- Well, somebody's got to.
- Bye-bye.

135
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:22,034
So, what are these plans?

136
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,334
What's the big goddamn secret?

137
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,434
You remember a guy named Clyde Bassie?

138
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,034
Got out of the joint a couple of years ago.

139
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,634
He went down to the Bahamas,
Paradise Island...

140
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,534
...and he got this car rental place.

141
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,233
He used to talk about it
all the time in the can.

142
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,333
He got out, he went down there,
put it together.

143
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,533
And it's doin' good. Real good.

144
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,433
I mean, like, it's makin' money.

145
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:02,233
Couple of months ago
he wrote me and he said...

146
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,433
...I could buy in any time
I got $75,000 together.

147
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,333
You're gonna rent cars.

148
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:24,732
What are you laughing at?

149
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,632
- You're gonna rent cars.
- That's right. I know a lot about cars.

150
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,432
I've been stealing 'em since I was 14.

151
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,832
Look at him laugh.

152
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,032
I'll tell you something.

153
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:48,732
Car rental guys don't get killed that much.

154
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,031
And where are you gonna get the $75,000?

155
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:58,331
I don't know. Maybe some rich relative
dies and leaves it to me.

156
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,231
It's a dream, Dave. You gotta dream, baby.

157
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,331
You got it all worked out, Carlito.
Here's to you.

158
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,231
So here's me back on the street.

159
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,831
Third Sunday in August.
Old Timer's Day in the barrio.

160
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,731
- When did you get out, papi?
- A couple of days ago.

161
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:20,331
Nothin' left.

162
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:24,630
Like them old cowboy movies,
but instead of tumbleweed and cow dung...

163
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,830
...we got stripped car wrecks and dog shit.

164
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,030
A lot of new faces?

165
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,530
These young guys, I don't recognize 'em.

166
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,130
Mi barrio ya no existe.

167
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,930
Carlito, man, Death Valley out here, man.

168
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,330
Mira, you know me, I take to the street
with any of these motherfuckers, man.

169
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,230
But these new kids nowadays, man,
they got no respect for human life.

170
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,030
They shotgun you,
just to see you fly up in the air.

171
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,230
'Chacho, you're better off in jail.

172
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,529
I don't even go
up to black Harlem no more.

173
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,329
They're fuckin' crazy up there.
Remember Victor?

174
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:04,029
- Victor, with the beard.
- He got shot right in front of the High.

175
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:06,729
Right in front of fuckin' Patrick Henry High.

176
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,929
- Y Lalin, you know him.
- Lalin Miasso. What happened to him?

177
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,729
Lalin's doin' thirty years in Attica, man.
Thirty years!

178
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,929
Walberto! Check it out. Mira who's here.

179
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,029
- Mira, eso. Oye.
- Hey, Wally.

180
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,929
- Heavy-duty.
- Good to see you.

181
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,028
I've been looking all over for you.

182
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,428
Should have figured
I'd find you walking around up here...

183
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:35,028
...doing a little "memory lane."
- While I still got one.

184
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:39,128
- Mira, Rolando wants to talk to you.
- Carlito, I gotta get back to the game.

185
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,028
You need anything, bodyguard,
anything, call me, okay?

186
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:44,828
- You call me. Take care.
- Pachanga. Good to see you.

187
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,528
- Rolando?
- Sí. He's around the corner.

188
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,328
Guajiro, wait here for me.

189
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,128
- In about five minutes, I'll be back.
- Sure, Carlito.

190
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,628
Who is that? New back-up man?

191
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:00,527
He's my little cousin.
I gotta visit my aunt later.

192
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,927
Carlito, mi socio.

193
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,027
¡Qué chévere!

194
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:11,327
I said a prayer for you
while you were inside...

195
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,127
...that harm will come
to him who harmed you.

196
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,727
- Thank you.
- Siéntate. Sit down.

197
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,827
- You are well?
- Well enough.

198
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,627
You look like you're doing good
for yourself.

199
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,127
Why not? Business is good.

200
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:31,727
- Smack.
- The coca business.

201
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,026
That's all there is. Heroin is dead.

202
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:38,926
- But you know all of this, right?
- No, I didn't know that.

203
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,626
Let's speak the truth between us.

204
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:55,526
You did five years
and never once mentioned my name.

205
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:59,326
I know that you could have given me up...

206
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:03,026
...and made things easier for yourself,
but you didn't.

207
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,525
Muy bien hecho. Good for you.

208
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,925
But you see I got rich
while you were inside.

209
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,725
Maybe you think I owe you?

210
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,225
I don't want anything from you.

211
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:20,025
- Who are you working with?
- I ain't working with nobody.

212
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:23,025
- Nobody?
- I'm retired.

213
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,425
- Retired?
- That's right.

214
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,025
Retired?

215
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,425
You're serious?

216
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,325
I'm serious. That's right. I'm out. I quit.

217
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:39,824
So, Carlito Brigante got religion, right?

218
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,724
That's right. I'm studying to be a priest.

219
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:50,924
So what are you doing these days?

220
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:54,024
Nothing much. I'm still in school.

221
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,624
I got a job though.

222
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,524
No kidding. Doing what?

223
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,724
Just a little legwork
for Señor Pablo Cabrales.

224
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,824
- Cabrales.
- Yeah.

225
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,024
What do you want to do that shit for?
That's not good.

226
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,124
Come on, Carlito.
I'm not making a career out of it.

227
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,423
I'm a delivery boy, that's all.

228
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,223
Check this out.

229
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,523
That's $30,000.

230
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,623
Can I ask you for a favor?

231
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:29,823
What's that?

232
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:33,523
I gotta go down the block for this pickup.
Can you come with me?

233
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:38,223
Come on. Don't get me involved
with that stuff.

234
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:41,023
Come on. I know these guys.
They're friends.

235
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,723
I just wanna walk in with you.

236
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,122
They see my back-up
and they'll shit in their pants.

237
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:49,022
- They ain't gonna know me.
- You?

238
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,122
You're a fuckin' legend.

239
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:53,022
Come on.

240
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:59,222
All right. 10 minutes. I promised
your mother we'd be there for dinner.

241
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,922
That's no problem.
These guys, they're real pros.

242
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,522
Boom, boom, in and out.

243
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,821
So the kid's walkin' in there with $30,000.

244
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:33,721
And the legend, me,
I'm walkin' right in with him.

245
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:36,321
Five minutes from now
we'll be on the streets...

246
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:39,221
...with $30,000 worth of very sweet candy...

247
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:42,921
...more than enough to put me
right back where I just come from.

248
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,721
- ¿Cómo está?
- Oye, Quisqueya. ¿Qué pasa?

249
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Coño, Guajiro. Who's this?

250
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,420
This is my cousin, man.
Primo mío, Carlito Brigante.

251
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,720
You heard of Carlito, right?

252
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
What you need him for?

253
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,120
Tranquilo, tranquilo.
I just come along for the ride, man.

254
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,820
Come on, Quisqueya, man.
You know Carlito, right?

255
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I got nothing here.

256
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,920
He just got out of Lewisburg, man.

257
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,920
He used to be partners with Rolando Rivas.

258
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,020
Carlito. I heard of you, man.

259
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,619
You used to run smack
with Rolando, right?

260
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,619
Little bit.

261
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,419
Little bit? Little bit, that's a good one.

262
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,519
I heard you guys were the fucking kings.

263
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,719
Lo siento, Carlito.

264
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,019
Hermanos, take care of Carlito.

265
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,119
We gotta do some business.

266
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,019
Hermanito.

267
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,519
- ¿Quierejugar?
- No, I'll watch.

268
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,918
- We're playing eight ball.
- Good game.

269
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:03,718
- You don't mind if I count it, right?
- It's all there, man.

270
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:05,918
I'll count it anyway.

271
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:09,018
- Maybe you'll lose a game.
- Right.

272
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:13,418
- You like that shot I did, right?
- That shot ain't nothin'.

273
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,018
Come on.

274
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,818
What're you in a rush for?
I'll beat you again.

275
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,318
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

276
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,817
- That's your bathroom there?
- That's the bathroom.

277
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,517
Don't work.

278
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:32,317
The toilet's backed up.

279
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,617
Sorry, man.

280
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,517
- Don't work?
- No, don't work.

281
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,417
I can wait another week.

282
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,317
Come back then, we'll have it fixed for you.

283
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,817
Turn it up! I love that song!

284
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,816
Mira, you wanna play or what?

285
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:03,816
Be cool. I'm rackin', man. Shit.

286
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,416
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

287
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:24,116
- You're playin' eight ball, right?
- Yeah.

288
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:27,216
I can't resist this.
I gotta show you people a shot.

289
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,915
- We're in the middle of a game here!
- You're playin' eight ball.

290
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:34,815
Right before you rack. It's nothin'.
It ain't gonna bother your game.

291
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:38,115
You ain't gonna believe this.
Gonna line 'em up like this.

292
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,315
- You gonna show us a trick shot?
- No trick shot. This is magic time.

293
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:47,715
After you see this shot,
you're gonna give up your religious beliefs.

294
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:51,115
Quisqueya, you gotta check this out.

295
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:54,315
- Carlito's doin' one of his trick shots.
- Guajiro.

296
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:56,915
I ain't done counting yet.

297
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:03,014
You want a cold beer, hermano?

298
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:06,514
Help yourself, man.

299
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:09,214
- Took me six months to learn this shot.
- Six months?

300
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:11,514
- You gotta help me though.
- Sure.

301
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,114
See this?

302
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:15,614
- Over the 12.
- Okay.

303
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:19,614
- So how's your boss?
- He's good. I saw him this morning.

304
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:26,814
Put your finger right here,
right on top of the 12, to hold it there, see?

305
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,914
- Like that?
- You gotta get it even with that.

306
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:40,213
- So you didn't hear the news?
- What news?

307
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,713
There's no beer down here, man.

308
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:45,013
Sure, way down in the bottom.

309
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:49,213
Me and Clyde Bassie were working on this.

310
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:52,313
You lookin' at that nine?
Let me have your cue.

311
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:54,413
Line 'em up.

312
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,313
- They even?
- They look even to me.

313
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:02,113
Come on, Quisqueya. What news?

314
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,512
Your boss is dead and so are you.

315
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,011
I'm reloaded!

316
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,111
Come on in here, motherfuckers!

317
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,610
Come on, I'm waitin' for ya!

318
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,510
You ain't comin' in?

319
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,910
I'm comin' out!

320
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,910
You're up against it now, motherfuckers!

321
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,410
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

322
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,610
You think you're big time?

323
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,010
You're gonna fuckin' die big time!

324
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:48,809
You ready?

325
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:54,409
Here comes the pain!

326
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:26,308
Oh, Jesus.

327
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,208
Jesus Christ, look at you.

328
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:34,708
You said they were friends, Guajiro...

329
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:39,108
...but there ain't no friends
in this shit business.

330
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,507
Adiós, primo.

331
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:09,507
All right, what happened?

332
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:20,407
Ain't no more rackets out here...

333
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:23,506
...just a bunch of cowboys
ripping each other off.

334
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:34,106
I don't invite this shit. It just comes to me.

335
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,606
I run, it runs after me.

336
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:41,406
Gotta be somewhere to hide.

337
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:47,806
So I took a look at this, Saso's place.
It's good. It's a nice location.

338
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:51,406
Somebody ran it right,
it could do good business.

339
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,406
Great. I'll advance you $25,000.

340
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,505
No, I'm gonna put my own money in.

341
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:00,705
Your own money? What money is that?

342
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:04,805
I ran into Rolando.
He owed me from an old thing, $25,000...

343
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:08,305
...so, that's the only way
I'm gonna do it, Dave.

344
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,105
You got it. Terrific.

345
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:15,405
So you'll call Saso,
tell him I'll see him tonight.

346
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:20,205
Done. I want to talk to you
about something. I need a little favor.

347
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:23,805
It's no big deal, but I need a bodyguard.
Somebody good.

348
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,204
Who's bothering you? I know 'em?

349
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:30,904
It's no big deal.
Just a little misunderstanding.

350
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,704
If it's no big deal,
what do you need a bodyguard for?

351
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,504
Will you trust me on this?
It's just temporary.

352
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:40,304
I'll get someone of my own later,
but I want someone right away.

353
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:45,604
There's Pachanga,
one of the old barrio crowd. He's good.

354
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,004
Great.

355
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,504
You okay?

356
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,504
I got a good feeling about this club.

357
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:59,104
I think we're gonna make
some real money.

358
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,803
I got a good feeling about it too...

359
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:05,103
...but as soon as I make my $75,000...

360
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,703
...I'm splittin'.

361
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:09,703
That's right.

362
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:13,403
You're gonna rent Ford Pintos
to tourists in Paradise.

363
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,503
That's right,
with a big smile on my face, too.

364
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,701
Times have changed.

365
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:21,201
What happened to the miniskirts?

366
00:30:21,301 --> 00:30:23,401
Where's all that marijuana?

367
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:28,501
Now everything is platforms, cocaine,
and dances I don't dance.

368
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:32,501
What a man gotta come to
when he loses five years.

369
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:36,801
But some shit never changes, like Saso.

370
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,200
Charlie, my friend! Charlie Brigante!
How you doing?

371
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,700
Hey, Saso.

372
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,100
No, no more Saso.
Now everybody calls me Ron.

373
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,100
- Ron?
- Ron from Reinaldo.

374
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,100
Okay, Ron, let's get to the point.

375
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,100
I hear you're doing good business
with this place.

376
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
- Very good.
- So how come you need money?

377
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,100
- Me?
- You gamblin' again, right?

378
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
How much you owe?

379
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
I don't know, maybe $50,000 or $60,000.

380
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,099
That means about $100,000.
Who you owe the money to?

381
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:13,399
You know, Charles, some of the boys.

382
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:18,399
$25,000 will quiet them for now,
and you'll come in for a quarter of my end.

383
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,699
Okay, I'm gonna give you
$25,000 cash tomorrow.

384
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,099
I'm gonna come in for half your end.

385
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,699
What are you trying to do to me?

386
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,299
What I'm trying to do, Saso,
I mean Ron, is save your ass.

387
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,399
Right, because it's either Fat Anthony
or Scooze you owe the money to, right?

388
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,399
Either way, you're gonna end up
in the trunk of a car...

389
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,798
...somewhere on the Belt Parkway
before long.

390
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:47,098
May be weeks before they find you.
Like DeeDee.

391
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,498
Remember? They open her up.

392
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:52,498
That's some kind of stink
you're gonna make.

393
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:56,398
"What's that smell?" Saso, man.

394
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,298
That's Saso. Used to be Ron.

395
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,398
Okay, okay. What time tomorrow?

396
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:09,098
So here's me in the club
playing Humphrey Bogart.

397
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:13,898
Things can get very sticky after hours,
so I bring in Pachanga...

398
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,097
...little extra back-up.

399
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:18,397
He thinks I'm gonna make him rich...

400
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:21,797
...so he's worried I'm gonna get killed
before he scores.

401
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:24,697
I heard about that shit with your cousin.

402
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:27,297
Why didn't you call me
so I could watch your ass?

403
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:30,097
That happened a month ago.
You just found out?

404
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:33,697
You got me chasin' Kleinberg
in the daytime and then you got me here...

405
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:37,897
Kleinfeld! I hope you're doin' a better job
with him than you are with me.

406
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,697
The guy got a lot of money.

407
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:43,197
He got a safe in the office
with stacks of hundreds just waitin'...

408
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,297
Kleinfeld is my brother. Look at me.

409
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,996
He is my brother.

410
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:51,196
Pachanga's only fuckin' around.

411
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,496
Don't fuck around.
Just keep your eyes open.

412
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,396
Watch the bar. They're stealin' money.

413
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,796
I wanna try, but it's so dark in here.
What do you want me to do?

414
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:02,496
The guy over there says
he don't have to pay.

415
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:05,996
- What guy is that?
- The guy in the red over there.

416
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:11,496
What are you doin'?

417
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:14,096
- Shut up and kiss me.
- Excuse me.

418
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:18,296
- Something wrong with the check?
- Yeah, there's something wrong with it.

419
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,495
- Baby, come on...
- Mira!

420
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:23,295
- Benny!
- What, man?

421
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:27,995
Shit. Fuck. Shit, man.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brigante.

422
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:30,095
I'm sorry. I got no problem.

423
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:34,095
See, Fat Man Saso there owes me money
and he's a little slow in paying me.

424
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:37,695
So I'm just working it off for him.
We haven't been formally introduced.

425
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:41,195
- My name is Benny Blanco from the Bronx.
- You know me?

426
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:44,695
I know you. You're Carlito Brigante,
motherfucker-to-the-max.

427
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:49,095
I don't know you.
So I don't owe you. Saso does.

428
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,795
My place now, new rules.

429
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:54,594
Everybody pays. Okay?

430
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,294
Okay. That's cool, that's groovy.

431
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:01,294
What's the matter with you?
Pay the fuckin' goddamn check, bitch.

432
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:03,894
- To the waiter.
- To the waiter, you dumb fuck!

433
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:06,894
And get us some champagne,
some of that French shit.

434
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:08,894
Have a glass, man.

435
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:11,394
- No, thank you...
- I wanna pick your brain.

436
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,294
Get him a chair. The man is standing!

437
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:16,094
Get him a chair.
Get the stupid look off your face.

438
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:18,394
You know who this man is?

439
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:22,694
This man here, he's the fuckin' J.P. Morgan
of the smack business.

440
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,893
First time I ever heard that.

441
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:28,893
Come on, man. You had 90, 100 guys
on the street. Right?

442
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:31,793
- Something like that.
- I'm starting out small.

443
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,593
I'm just building my organization.

444
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:36,293
I'm refining it
and maximizing my potentialities.

445
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:38,993
I got my finger on some shit
that's about to explode.

446
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:40,793
If you can just give me two minutes...

447
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,093
- Maybe next time. All the best to ya.
- Two minutes of your time.

448
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:45,693
I'll talk to you again.

449
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,293
Just two minutes. That's all.

450
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,693
Fucking kids.

451
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:56,493
Move a couple of ounces,
think they're a big shot.

452
00:34:57,192 --> 00:35:00,492
Make a few bucks while I'm in the joint,
I gotta respect 'em.

453
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,892
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck that shit.

454
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:07,592
Talk to me about this.

455
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:25,792
Carlito, I see you was talkin'
to Benny Blanco before.

456
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,691
Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

457
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,591
- They say he's comin' up in the world.
- Do they?

458
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,491
He's got a big future...

459
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,991
...if he can live past next week.

460
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,791
How come a good-lookin' dude like you...

461
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,891
...doesn't have a woman?

462
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,091
Well, I guess I'm a workaholic.

463
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,291
What's the matter?

464
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:58,891
Don't you ever see nobody
you like in here?

465
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,290
Nobody but you, Stef.

466
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,790
Jesus, she looks like Gail.

467
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,190
Same color hair. The way she dances.

468
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,590
I met Gail a year before
I went into thejoint.

469
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,190
She was this dancer,
this artistic ballet-type...

470
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,890
...was gonna be a big Broadway star.

471
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,290
I guess she fell in love.

472
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:32,590
Me too. I swore I'd never break her heart,
but, you know, things happen.

473
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:36,389
I miss you, Gail.

474
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:19,488
When you're in thejoint
you spend all your time...

475
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:23,288
...dopin' out who you're gonna see
the first day you're out.

476
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:25,788
The second day. The third.

477
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:31,188
But then you get out, everybody's got
a different face than you remember.

478
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,988
Maybe you do too.

479
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:37,188
You pray for one face that didn't change.

480
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:41,387
One face that still knows you...

481
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:45,587
...looks at you the same way it always did.

482
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:42,084
I couldn't figure it out.
I couldn't get that thing to save my life.

483
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,884
- Bye, Gail.
- See you next week.

484
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,884
- I know you, lady.
- Buzz off.

485
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:49,983
Sure, you used to go out with that guy.

486
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,483
What's his name? That good-looking guy.

487
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,683
Yeah, Carlito Brigante. That's right.

488
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,483
Hello, Gail.

489
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:18,783
I was in the road company
of this show called Songbird last year.

490
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,383
I played the Governor's daughter.

491
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:24,482
It wasn't the lead, but it was a great part.

492
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:28,982
And I did this musical book show
last year in Vegas.

493
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:33,282
I hated the weather. You ever been there?

494
00:40:33,982 --> 00:40:37,082
Vegas? Yeah.
So are you in something now?

495
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,382
I can come downtown and see you.

496
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:44,682
I'm just, you know, doing club dates
right now, mostly one-nighters though.

497
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:49,582
But I'm up for this play that goes this fall...

498
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,182
That's great.

499
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,381
You're livin' what
you always dreamed about.

500
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,781
I'm getting close.

501
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:02,481
I am getting close.
I'm not there yet, but it's okay.

502
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,481
What was it like inside?

503
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,081
No big thing.

504
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:20,081
A lot of push-ups. A lot of wasted time.

505
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:25,181
- You're out now.
- Yeah. Here I am.

506
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,880
Am I outta line? Just poppin' up like this
after all these years?

507
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
You still pissed at me?

508
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,680
What do you think?

509
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,380
You dumped me hard, Charlie.

510
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,780
Now you want to tell me
it was for my own good, right?

511
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,079
No, it was for mine. It was for mine.

512
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:01,979
It was for my own good.
I was doin' thirty years.

513
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,679
What was I supposed to do? I knew
you were gonna try and wait for me.

514
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:09,179
You were gonna visit me,
make me think about you all the time.

515
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,079
Now what was I supposed to do?
There I am sittin' in jail...

516
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:16,679
...wonderin' all the time where you are...

517
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,179
...what you're doin', who you're with.

518
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:21,479
That'd have drove me crazy.

519
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:24,079
It'd have killed me. Believe me.

520
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,979
Best to just cut it clean, you know?

521
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,478
Do my time with a clear head.

522
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:38,478
So, now what?

523
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:48,178
Now what? I don't know.
I'm here. I'm out.

524
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:51,378
For whatever that's worth.

525
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:55,678
What about this club of yours?

526
00:42:56,078 --> 00:42:59,978
It's not my club, you know.
I just got a piece of it.

527
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,978
Just trying to make enough money...

528
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:08,977
With my luck,
somebody's gonna get shot...

529
00:43:09,077 --> 00:43:12,477
...the cops are gonna come
and close it down, you know.

530
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:17,877
That doesn't sound like you.

531
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:20,977
It doesn't? Really?

532
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,177
You never talked like this before.

533
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:26,377
Never felt like this before.

534
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:29,877
It's a funny thing.

535
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,777
This guy, this counselor at Lewisburg...

536
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,276
...Mr. Seawald, once said to me:

537
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:40,476
"Charlie, you run out of steam.

538
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:45,276
"You can't sprint all the way.
You gotta stop sometime.

539
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:49,476
"You can't buck it forever.
It catches up to you.

540
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:51,676
"It gets you.

541
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,576
"You don't get reformed...

542
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:00,276
"...you just run out of wind."

543
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:15,475
I'd better go.

544
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:20,975
Can I call you sometime?

545
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:25,375
Why don't you let me call you?

546
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:32,075
- You know where to find me, right?
- Yeah.

547
00:44:51,174 --> 00:44:53,674
You said you wouldn't break my heart.

548
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:59,974
I know. I'm sorry.

549
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:06,274
I'm sorry.

550
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:14,873
Good night.

551
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:58,772
Mr. Taglialucci to see his lawyer,
Mr. Kleinfeld.

552
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:00,272
Go ahead.

553
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,072
Tony, how are you?

554
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:08,572
- Okay, Jackson, beat it.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Taglialucci.

555
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:13,172
You look good.

556
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:17,672
Don't make me do it, Kleinfeld.
Just write this down, all right?

557
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:22,571
It's 555-5888.

558
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:25,871
That's my kid Frankie's
home phone number...

559
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:28,071
...and I'll tell you why in a minute.

560
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:31,771
Shut up!

561
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,771
I never liked you, Kleinfeld.
Not 'cause you're a Jew.

562
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:47,571
I know plenty of Jews.
It's 'cause you're a lyin' piece of shit.

563
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:52,270
Now, I give you a million bucks to make
a simple payoff and nothin' happens.

564
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,070
Look, I told your son
I gave Nicky the money personally.

565
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,270
If he decides to betray that
and testify against you anyway...

566
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,170
...I can hardly be...
- You look at my hands.

567
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,070
Now, you make me raise my voice
and I'll snap your neck like a bread stick.

568
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,570
You fuckin' phony.
What do you take me for?

569
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,270
Nicky never saw dollar one of my money.

570
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,470
My million bucks went straight
into your pockets.

571
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,670
- I personally...
- Don't fuckin' lie to me, you scumbag.

572
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,470
You lie to me again,
you're gonna end up in that river out there.

573
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:27,269
You think about this when you go out,
and you'll take a look down...

574
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,469
...and imagine what it'll feel like...

575
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:34,369
...slidin' around down the bottom with eels
and crabs crawlin' outta your eyeballs.

576
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,269
What do you want from me?

577
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:47,569
- I understand you got a boat.
- Yeah.

578
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,369
- You're gonna get me outta here.
- I'm doing every...

579
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,369
My entire office is devoted
to your appeal right now.

580
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:59,068
- I talked to the judge this morning.
- I ain't talkin' about no appeal.

581
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,668
I'm talkin' about you bustin' me outta here.

582
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,468
I'm a lawyer.

583
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:12,468
Listen, you lawyer-fuck,
I got a million-dollar credit with you.

584
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,168
My kid Frankie'll go with you
and keep an eye on you...

585
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,068
...make sure everything goes right.

586
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:20,968
You see that guard
that brought me in here?

587
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:25,368
He's been taken care of, and he's gonna
set it up to get me into the water.

588
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:30,167
All you gotta do is be there
with the boat to pick me up.

589
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,767
This is not exactly the kind of...

590
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,967
The contract's already down on you, pal.

591
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:41,767
The guys, the guns,
the lime pit's already dug.

592
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:46,167
You understand?
And from in here, just one button I push.

593
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:26,266
What?

594
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:28,766
Mr. Norwalk from
the District Attorney's office.

595
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,566
I said no calls!

596
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,166
No, he's here.

597
00:49:40,465 --> 00:49:42,065
Mr. Kleinfeld?

598
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:44,265
Give me a second, please.

599
00:49:51,365 --> 00:49:54,465
- Mr. Kleinfeld, are you there?
- Send him in.

600
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:05,065
How are you?

601
00:50:05,665 --> 00:50:09,364
- Good to see you. Have a seat.
- Hope you don't mind. I was in the area.

602
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,864
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was about to call you.

603
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,364
Your problems aren't just
going to go away.

604
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:42,563
Here's me in the club countin' every dollar.

605
00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:48,063
On top of the $25,000 I put in,
I already pulled out another $14,000.

606
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:54,063
$35,000 or $40,000 more,
and I'm gone, daddy, gone.

607
00:50:54,663 --> 00:50:56,563
Two, maybe three months.

608
00:50:58,163 --> 00:51:00,163
Just gotta mark time now...

609
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:02,763
...lie low, keep outta trouble...

610
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:05,463
...and off people's minds.

611
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:10,862
Lalin is here. In the office.

612
00:51:10,962 --> 00:51:13,462
- Lalin?
- You wanna see him?

613
00:51:13,962 --> 00:51:17,562
- You told me he was doin' thirty years.
- I guess he got out.

614
00:51:18,762 --> 00:51:21,962
- How's he doin'?
- Not as good as you, but, you know...

615
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:23,862
I don't know what that means.

616
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:30,062
Lalin was a neighborhood guy,
real good-lookin' son of a bitch.

617
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:33,862
He used to work in
this private gamblingjoint on West 87th.

618
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:38,362
He was kind of a greeter for the place,
set guys up with broads.

619
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,862
Now anybody ask me about Lalin...

620
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:45,661
...I have to say, he's a stand-up guy.

621
00:51:55,661 --> 00:51:58,461
- Look at you, man, look at you.
- Hey, hermano.

622
00:51:58,561 --> 00:52:00,961
How you doin', man? What a place.

623
00:52:01,061 --> 00:52:02,861
What happened to you?

624
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,661
What do you mean? You didn't hear?

625
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:08,361
I took a few in the back.

626
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:12,461
When the street's really mad at you,
she don't put you in a box...

627
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,661
...she puts you in one of these things.

628
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,760
- ¿ Tu quieres?
- No. I'm workin'.

629
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,360
- How about a drink? You want one?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

630
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,860
Pachanga, tell me what's goin' on up there.

631
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,660
Come on, man, tell me.

632
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,560
Take care, all right?

633
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,360
I seen that chick
you used to go around with.

634
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,960
The one from the Bahamas.

635
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,860
You know, la rubia.
The one that looks like my sister.

636
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,159
That's Gail.

637
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,959
I seen her in this show
on 48th and Broadway.

638
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:55,159
When was this?

639
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:58,859
Two weeks ago.
She was in this fantastic show.

640
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:04,459
I mean, like artistic, you know,
but a lot of talent.

641
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:07,359
That girl's got a lot of talent.

642
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:09,859
48th and Broadway?

643
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,359
Let me get another drink.

644
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:20,459
So, you back in business?

645
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:25,458
I'm retired, Lalin. Told you that.
No more business for me.

646
00:53:27,258 --> 00:53:31,558
Come on. All them people in Lewisburg
and you're telling me you didn't connect?

647
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:36,158
I did a lot of reading.
Worked on my appeal, that kind of thing.

648
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:39,458
What about you? What is this?

649
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,258
Pachanga told me
you was doin' thirty years.

650
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,158
Yeah. Beat it.

651
00:53:45,758 --> 00:53:47,958
You beat it? How'd you do that?

652
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:52,558
You know, like you, I did a lot of reading...

653
00:53:52,558 --> 00:53:56,257
...and I worked with some guys,
some smart guys in the joint...

654
00:53:56,757 --> 00:53:58,857
...and just beat it, that's all.

655
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:01,357
No shit. That's good.

656
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:03,757
Here's to you.

657
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:06,557
To you. "Free at last."

658
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:16,857
Listen, I'm in with some new people now.
Unos italianos, tú sabes.

659
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:19,557
They trust you.
They think you're a fuckin' guinea.

660
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:22,757
- Where are they from? Pleasant Avenue?
- Downtown.

661
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:26,056
Anyway, they got the money.
They got a lot of money.

662
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:30,356
Some heavy paper. They go up to $25,000
for a key, if it's good shit, you know.

663
00:54:30,456 --> 00:54:35,556
They want regular street people,
gente del barrio. Old school all the way.

664
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:39,456
- Stand-up guys like us, right, Lalin?
- Old school, baby.

665
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:42,656
So what you say? You and me,
just like old times.

666
00:54:42,756 --> 00:54:44,956
You bring the people you're with now.

667
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:49,956
I ain't with nobody. I told you that.
I ain't connected no more.

668
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:54,156
Come on, man!
You forget who you're talking to?

669
00:55:10,455 --> 00:55:12,055
- Look at this.
- Wait a minute.

670
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:15,555
This how you beat your thirty years,
you piece of shit?

671
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:18,955
- Let me explain.
- I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

672
00:55:19,255 --> 00:55:23,355
- Fuckin' push you in the fuckin' river!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

673
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:26,255
Wait a minute. Wait a fuckin' second!

674
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:31,554
You a fuckin' chivo, man?
You a fuckin' rat? I'll fuckin' kill him!

675
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:33,654
Let me kill him for you!

676
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:36,254
Let him fuckin' kill me! Fuck you!

677
00:55:36,454 --> 00:55:39,054
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Look what I got!

678
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:43,254
I mean, look at me! You got everything!

679
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:45,354
I mean, come on!

680
00:55:46,154 --> 00:55:50,054
Look what I gotta fucking go around with:
Fucking diapers!

681
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:53,254
I got fucking diapers!
I shit in my pants every day!

682
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:55,454
I can't walk, I can't hump.

683
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,054
Go ahead and kill me, you cocksucker!

684
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:10,253
They made me do it, or they send me back.

685
00:56:10,353 --> 00:56:13,453
I'm no good in the joint.
I'm in a fucking wheelchair.

686
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:22,553
- It wasn't even turned on.
- Who sent you? Listen to me now.

687
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:24,553
Who sent you?

688
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:28,453
- Who sent you, motherfucker?
- The D.A.

689
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:29,753
Norwalk?

690
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:35,652
- Norwalk?
- He got a hard-on for you, man.

691
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:38,152
Got a tip you were dealing again, big time.

692
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:40,852
I was dealing? Who told him that?

693
00:56:40,952 --> 00:56:44,552
I been clean. I haven't made
one fuckin' move. Who told him that?

694
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,552
- I don't know.
- Who told him that?

695
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:49,152
Man, I swear to God, I don't know!

696
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:56,652
I would never give you up.
I would never do that.

697
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:58,452
I was gonna give you a signal.

698
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:02,352
It wasn't even turned on.
It's something else, man!

699
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,552
Look, let me...

700
00:57:06,952 --> 00:57:09,651
Just do it, man! Just fuckin' kill me.

701
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:12,651
I ain't gonna kill you.

702
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,951
I ain't even gonna hurt you.

703
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:23,951
I ask you...

704
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:29,451
...how can you fuck the only people
who ever cared for you?

705
00:57:30,451 --> 00:57:32,751
How do you do that?

706
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,451
You lost, motherfucker.

707
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:41,050
I'm gonna get somebody to wheel you out.

708
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,750
Déjame explicar...

709
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,550
Some fuck told Norwalk
I was dealin' again.

710
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,950
Come in.

711
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,150
Do you know who it was?

712
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,750
All I know is he sent somebody
to talk to me wearin' a wire.

713
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,650
That son of a bitch.

714
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,550
He's been leaning on me too,
about other shit.

715
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:16,049
I ain't dealin'. I ain't goin'
back to prison no matter what!

716
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:20,849
Relax. You're not dealing,
so he can't have anything on you.

717
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:24,849
This is the way this guy is.
He's on a goddamn fishing expedition.

718
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:27,749
I'll take care of it. All right? Come on.

719
00:58:30,649 --> 00:58:32,449
Fuckin' Lalin, man.

720
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:35,449
He has nobody.

721
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,349
He has nobody left.

722
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:58,048
How about you, sir? Check it out, man.

723
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:01,348
What's up, man? Check it out.
What's happenin', man?

724
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:03,848
Cool, man. Take that.

725
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:03,244
This is a surprise.

726
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,544
Big surprise.

727
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:07,744
Diet Pepsi.

728
01:01:12,244 --> 01:01:15,944
You were really terrific.

729
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:18,244
- I mean, really...
- Thanks.

730
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:21,244
...very, how do I say...

731
01:01:23,044 --> 01:01:24,244
Sexy?

732
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:28,043
- Exactly.
- That is the desired effect.

733
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:33,643
- Miss, that was just wonderful!
- Really, really wonderful!

734
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:36,643
- Thank you very much.
- Really, really wonderful.

735
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:38,143
Thanks a lot.

736
01:01:42,043 --> 01:01:43,143
Fans.

737
01:01:50,643 --> 01:01:52,243
What's the matter?

738
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,643
Nothin'. No, I was just...

739
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:02,042
This situation, I think, maybe is...

740
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:04,642
Situation?

741
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:09,442
I didn't expect this kind of thing.
That's all.

742
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:13,842
I mean, you told me you was
in a musical of some sort.

743
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:16,842
I thought you was doin' a Broadway show.

744
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:19,942
You told me the Governor's daughter,
whatever you were playing.

745
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:21,942
And I come here and see this.

746
01:02:22,842 --> 01:02:25,142
Not that there's anything wrong with this.

747
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,642
Wait a second. I work hard here.

748
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:33,641
I dance. I get well-paid for it.
I don't fuck anybody.

749
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,641
I didn't say that. Now, please.

750
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:39,241
You're sitting there judging me.

751
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:42,341
I'm not judgin' you. Please don't say that.

752
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:47,241
I don't judge you.
What do you do that's so wonderful?

753
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,841
You ever kill anybody, Charlie?

754
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:02,141
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

755
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,440
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
just busted in like this.

756
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,540
My fault. I apologize.

757
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,840
I better go now.

758
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,040
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go home.

759
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,140
When am I gonna see you again?

760
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,040
Why don't you surprise me another time?

761
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,140
- Like when?
- I can't tell you that.

762
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,540
- Why not?
- 'Cause it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

763
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:42,139
You know I want to feel your ass.

764
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,239
You already know my ass.

765
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:52,939
Come with me.

766
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,439
What the fuck are you lookin' at me for?

767
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:07,139
- Benny!
- How ya doin'?

768
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:14,138
- Benny Blanco from the Bronx!
- Hey, fat man.

769
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:15,938
The fattest man.

770
01:04:16,738 --> 01:04:18,838
- Where's my money?
- What money?

771
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,938
My money, man! You play pussy,
you gonna get fucked!

772
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:23,538
Are you kidding?

773
01:04:25,438 --> 01:04:27,038
- Where's Steffie?
- Steffie?

774
01:04:27,038 --> 01:04:29,438
Get me Steffie, man. I'm lonely.

775
01:04:29,738 --> 01:04:32,038
- Sí. Dígame.
- ¿Dónde está Steffie?

776
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:34,938
- Yo la vi por ahí.
- Vete a buscarla ya.

777
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:37,438
Muy bien.

778
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:05,237
¡Madre de Dios!

779
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:09,137
After that, she got six fucking kids.

780
01:05:09,837 --> 01:05:13,337
There is a problem with Mr. Kleinfeld.

781
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:17,436
- What kind of problem?
- He's in the bathroom fucking Steffie.

782
01:05:18,536 --> 01:05:21,636
So, what's the problem? Good for him.

783
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,436
But she belongs to Benny Blanco now.

784
01:05:24,836 --> 01:05:25,536
Who?

785
01:05:25,836 --> 01:05:28,136
You remember Benny Blanco
from the Bronx?

786
01:05:28,236 --> 01:05:32,136
- That little piece of shit from the other day.
- Not that guy. Fuck him.

787
01:05:32,236 --> 01:05:35,536
He's here, and he's gonna make trouble.

788
01:05:35,636 --> 01:05:37,536
- Where is he?
- Over there.

789
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:45,136
Fuck him! Don't worry
about Benny Blanco. Go ahead, it's okay.

790
01:05:46,436 --> 01:05:48,835
What do I do when they tell me that?

791
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:55,435
You gotta learn to live with it.

792
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,835
Where've you been hiding this man?
This is one sexy man.

793
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:03,135
- He's an animal. You know that?
- Faster than a speeding bullet.

794
01:06:07,135 --> 01:06:10,935
Yeah, but he got himself
a Mercedes and a yacht, all of that.

795
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,435
Mr. Benny Blanco says it's gonna be okay.

796
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:18,735
He wants to send
a bottle of champagne over...

797
01:06:18,835 --> 01:06:22,034
...and he wants you to send Steffie over,
when you're ready.

798
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:28,434
- Carlito, what should I do?
- No problem. Steffie's with Dave now.

799
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:30,734
But Benny said...

800
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:32,734
Fuck Benny!

801
01:06:37,634 --> 01:06:39,434
This is from Benny Blanco.

802
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:40,634
Send it back!

803
01:06:41,634 --> 01:06:42,834
¡Vete! ¡Vete!

804
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,934
Please, you can't do this.

805
01:06:47,234 --> 01:06:51,234
- Benny spends a lot of money here.
- He's a nickel-bagger. Come on.

806
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:55,233
What happened to you?
What are you acting like this for?

807
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:59,833
It doesn't make sense you should hate
this guy. This guy is you 20 years ago.

808
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:01,433
Never me.

809
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:10,033
This is the second time
you turned me down for a drink.

810
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:13,133
- You don't like my champagne?
- It could be.

811
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:17,033
Maybe there's a mis-fucking-understanding.

812
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:20,433
- Maybe you don't remember me.
- Maybe I don't give a shit.

813
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:24,433
Maybe I don't remember the last time
I blew my nose either.

814
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:27,232
Who the fuck are you,
I should remember you?

815
01:07:27,732 --> 01:07:30,032
What, you think you're like me?

816
01:07:30,432 --> 01:07:33,432
You ain't like me, motherfucker.
You're a punk.

817
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,732
I've been with made people,
connected people.

818
01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:38,832
Who you been with?

819
01:07:39,832 --> 01:07:44,032
Chain-snatchin', jive-ass,
maricón motherfuckers.

820
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:49,132
Why don't you get lost? Go ahead,
snatch a purse. Take a fuckin' walk.

821
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,832
The only problem here is that
Steffie doesn't know where she belongs.

822
01:07:52,832 --> 01:07:57,231
- Steffie belongs here.
- I think Steffie's makin' a big mistake!

823
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:01,831
I'll blow your fucking head off.

824
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:09,531
- I'll blow this cocksucker's head off.
- Put that fuckin' gun away!

825
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,031
- How does it feel?
- Go! Go!

826
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:13,731
How does it feel?

827
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:19,131
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

828
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,331
What the fuck is this?

829
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:27,831
Watch the floor!

830
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:32,030
We've got a mis-fuckin'-communication
here, man!

831
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:37,530
Hold it! Stop him here.

832
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,330
Okay, Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

833
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:45,430
The chick Steffie belongs to the club.

834
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:51,230
If I ever see you here again...

835
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,330
...you die, just like that.

836
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:02,229
You're over, man.
You're fuckin' in the history books.

837
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:06,629
So you might as well kill me now, 'cause if
I ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you.

838
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:19,029
Get him out. Take him out the back.

839
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,429
Take him in the alley.

840
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:29,129
Dumb move, man. Dumb move.

841
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:32,329
But it's like them old reflexes comin' back.

842
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:36,428
I know what's supposed to happen now.

843
01:09:36,528 --> 01:09:38,128
Benny's gotta go down.

844
01:09:39,128 --> 01:09:41,828
And if I don't do it, they're gonna say:

845
01:09:42,128 --> 01:09:46,028
"Carlito, he's flaky, man. Slacked-out.

846
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:50,528
"A used-to-be bad guy.
Joint got to Carlito."

847
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:56,428
The street is watchin'.
She is watchin' all the time.

848
01:09:56,728 --> 01:09:58,428
Hold it, hold it!

849
01:10:02,528 --> 01:10:05,728
Let's put him in the trunk of the car
and drive him off the pier.

850
01:10:05,828 --> 01:10:09,427
- Fuck you, man.
- It ain't that far. Down the block.

851
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:13,027
It'd be like the old days. Be fun.

852
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:18,827
- Let him go.
- What?

853
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,727
Let him go. Get him outta here.

854
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:24,627
Any other time, that punk would die,
but I can't do that shit no more.

855
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:27,927
Don't want to burn nobody,
even when I know I should.

856
01:10:28,027 --> 01:10:32,827
That ain't me now. All I want
is to get my $75,000 and get out.

857
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:34,727
Just do it!

858
01:10:37,027 --> 01:10:40,126
Tell me he's in a fuckin' coffin.
What happened?

859
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:44,426
Somethin' that shouldn't have happened.
Give me your piece, Dave.

860
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:45,926
What?

861
01:10:46,026 --> 01:10:48,826
Give me the fuckin' gun.
Since when are you a tough guy?

862
01:10:49,926 --> 01:10:51,726
Get yourself killed.

863
01:10:53,726 --> 01:10:55,626
I can take care of myself.

864
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,526
You think I'm some law school schmuck,
I never saw a bad guy before?

865
01:11:01,026 --> 01:11:04,626
You are gonna wave that thing
at the wrong guy...

866
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:08,426
...he's gonna take it from you
and bury it up your ass, guaranteed.

867
01:11:08,826 --> 01:11:10,926
Now give me the gun. Come on.

868
01:11:20,225 --> 01:11:23,025
I know you love me, kid,
but you gotta lighten up.

869
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,825
Listen...

870
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:32,125
...I'm throwin' a big party
out at my summer house Saturday.

871
01:11:32,225 --> 01:11:35,125
I want you to come.
Something I wanna talk to you about.

872
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,225
Why can't you talk to me about it here?

873
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,925
I'll tell you Saturday. I need visual aids.

874
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:28,023
What's the matter with you,
pushing this guy in the pool...

875
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:31,323
...your fucking friends knocking down
my rented tables?

876
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:02,122
What you doing out here by yourself?

877
01:13:04,122 --> 01:13:04,922
Sittin'.

878
01:13:05,822 --> 01:13:07,722
You sure are weird, baby.

879
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:10,522
How come you never try to fuck me?

880
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:14,622
You got into a big beef for me,
and you ain't never laid a glove on me.

881
01:13:14,722 --> 01:13:18,722
- You're Dave's girl now.
- He can't fuck me, all the coke he's doin'.

882
01:13:19,922 --> 01:13:23,121
- What are you two talking about?
- Fucking.

883
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:26,421
Speaking of fucking,
look at those fucking friends of yours.

884
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:28,221
They're a fucking embarrassment.

885
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:30,821
- Do something. Be a hostess.
- Fuck you, asshole!

886
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:32,521
Yeah, fuck me.

887
01:13:33,021 --> 01:13:37,421
Your fuckin' chick's giving you
a hand-job in front of everybody!

888
01:13:37,521 --> 01:13:40,521
I got guests here, for Christ's sake!
People are eating!

889
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:44,521
- Take it easy, Dave!
- You take it easy! Got any manners?

890
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:49,021
You wanna fuck her, fuck like a normal
human being! Take her to the bedroom!

891
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:52,921
People!

892
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,620
Okay, Dave, what's up?

893
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,720
- I need you to do something for me.
- What is it?

894
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,320
You gotta help me spring Tony Taglialucci
from the prison barge at Rikers.

895
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,020
Are you crazy?

896
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,820
He thinks I stole a million dollars from him.

897
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,519
This is a dying man. He's nuts.
He's totally fucking paranoid.

898
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:38,819
Do you realize what you just said to me?

899
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:43,519
If I don't do it, he's going
to have me killed. It's that simple.

900
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,119
So that means you're gonna
have to bust into prison?

901
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,219
What do you think, I'm crazy?

902
01:14:54,419 --> 01:14:56,719
He's gonna swim off the island.

903
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:59,618
- Gonna swim?
- Yeah.

904
01:15:01,218 --> 01:15:02,518
He's gonna drown.

905
01:15:05,218 --> 01:15:07,618
Not if you and I pick him up...

906
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:10,618
...in that.

907
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:14,818
Tony's got a guy on the inside
who'll get him in the water.

908
01:15:14,918 --> 01:15:17,918
I know these channels
like the back of my hand.

909
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:22,018
We cross Little Neck Bay
into the north corner to pick him up.

910
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:25,518
There's a buoy about 100 yards offshore.
That's where he's gonna be.

911
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:28,118
This is in and out, half hour tops.

912
01:15:29,518 --> 01:15:31,917
He's gonna jump off a barge...

913
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:34,717
...swim 100 yards...

914
01:15:35,717 --> 01:15:38,017
...to a buoy in the East River?

915
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:41,317
Impossible. It's too rough.
He's going to die.

916
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:44,917
That's his fucking problem.
There's no point in arguing.

917
01:15:45,017 --> 01:15:49,317
I have to do this. I'm asking for your help.

918
01:15:52,117 --> 01:15:56,217
You're a lawyer, man.
What the fuck is happenin' to you?

919
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,417
I don't know.

920
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:09,616
I am so fucking shook up,
I cannot see straight.

921
01:16:10,616 --> 01:16:13,516
I'm in an impossible fucking situation here.

922
01:16:16,716 --> 01:16:19,016
Once I get Tony on the shore...

923
01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:24,316
...there is a distinct possibility
that he and his goombah son...

924
01:16:24,516 --> 01:16:26,616
...have got some plans for me.

925
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,116
What do you mean, "plans"?
What kind of plans?

926
01:16:33,216 --> 01:16:36,915
How do I know he's not gonna kill me?
This guy hates my guts.

927
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:43,915
I'm in trouble. I am in fuckin' trouble here.

928
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,415
You are the only fucking person on earth...

929
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:50,315
...that I can trust.

930
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,815
And I'll give you $50,000 to go along.

931
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,815
If I go along, it ain't for the money.

932
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:07,315
Are you in?

933
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,314
When is this...

934
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:14,414
I don't know! His son's gonna call me.
Are you in?

935
01:17:20,914 --> 01:17:22,614
All right, I'm in.

936
01:17:26,414 --> 01:17:27,714
Thank you.

937
01:17:55,813 --> 01:17:56,913
Surprise.

938
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:02,013
I was asleep.

939
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:10,713
Can I come in?
I bought you some cheesecake.

940
01:18:13,013 --> 01:18:14,912
I don't like cheesecake.

941
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:19,512
You wouldn't have buzzed me up,
if you wasn't gonna let me in.

942
01:18:22,312 --> 01:18:24,212
I'm saying no, Charlie.

943
01:18:29,712 --> 01:18:31,212
What can I do?

944
01:18:33,312 --> 01:18:35,212
What are you gonna do?

945
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:40,112
Are you gonna...

946
01:18:41,512 --> 01:18:43,112
...bust the chain?

947
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:48,311
Chase me around the apartment?

948
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:54,511
Get me naked?

949
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,411
Take me on the floor?

950
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:06,011
- I'm too old for that.
- That's too bad.

951
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,811
If you can't get in...

952
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:15,611
...you don't get in.

953
01:20:31,608 --> 01:20:33,508
Where's my cheesecake?

954
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,307
Can I ask you a personal question?

955
01:20:58,507 --> 01:20:59,807
Anything.

956
01:21:04,507 --> 01:21:06,507
Did you ever kill anybody?

957
01:21:11,707 --> 01:21:13,107
I'm sorry.

958
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,407
Well, it's just not a simple question.

959
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:26,307
- I just can't answer it like...
- That's all right.

960
01:21:26,407 --> 01:21:28,707
- You don't have to...
...there it is.

961
01:21:28,707 --> 01:21:30,706
You don't have to answer.

962
01:21:35,706 --> 01:21:38,106
When I was a kid in East Harlem...

963
01:21:40,206 --> 01:21:41,806
...the wops said...

964
01:21:43,006 --> 01:21:45,706
...no spics could go east of Park Avenue.

965
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:50,606
Spooks said: "No 'Ricans
west of Fifth Avenue."

966
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,606
That don't leave you
much room to maneuver.

967
01:21:54,606 --> 01:21:58,806
Say you want to go to Central Park, play
with the ducks. You're shit outta luck.

968
01:21:59,006 --> 01:22:01,405
So what do you do? You go anyway.

969
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:05,205
I'm up on 106th Street,
Central Park, near the lake.

970
01:22:06,205 --> 01:22:09,705
I get caught by these Copiens. Right?
They surround me.

971
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,705
So I get my blood up, pull out my blade.

972
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:15,505
I said: "Come on!
I'll take any one of you mothers!"

973
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:20,205
They say: "No, man. We're gonna kill
your ass." Out come the zip guns.

974
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:22,905
Homemade gun.

975
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:27,405
You pull the hook back,
catch that bullet square, ping.

976
01:22:27,605 --> 01:22:30,805
Hit you in the head, man,
you got serious problems.

977
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:34,004
That was the last chase on me like that...

978
01:22:34,304 --> 01:22:37,104
...because from then on
I carried my own piece.

979
01:22:38,904 --> 01:22:42,704
Guys went down, yeah, but it ain't like,
you know, you just...

980
01:22:43,204 --> 01:22:45,904
...decide one day, and then that's it. No.

981
01:22:47,304 --> 01:22:50,904
You just do what you gotta do to survive.

982
01:22:51,904 --> 01:22:56,304
Somehow, you know,
you just end up where you are.

983
01:23:00,304 --> 01:23:02,804
That's how everybody ends up
where they are.

984
01:23:03,204 --> 01:23:04,504
Everybody.

985
01:23:06,603 --> 01:23:09,703
Only I'm gettin' out. I'm gonna rent cars.

986
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:14,403
What're you laughing at?

987
01:23:14,803 --> 01:23:17,703
Everybody laughs at that. That's a dream.

988
01:23:18,103 --> 01:23:19,803
I know, I'm sorry.

989
01:23:20,003 --> 01:23:22,203
Didn't you ever have a dream?

990
01:23:22,403 --> 01:23:24,003
Of course I did.

991
01:23:25,803 --> 01:23:29,703
The Diamond Room isn't exactly
the end of my rainbow, you know.

992
01:23:29,903 --> 01:23:31,103
It's just...

993
01:23:33,203 --> 01:23:34,203
I don't know.

994
01:23:40,502 --> 01:23:42,902
Just sometimes I hear myself talk...

995
01:23:46,502 --> 01:23:52,102
...about new agents and auditions,
and I'm trying to be so optimistic.

996
01:23:57,002 --> 01:23:58,502
Then I think...

997
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:01,702
...why should I be so optimistic?

998
01:24:13,701 --> 01:24:15,501
Yeah, I had a dream...

999
01:24:18,201 --> 01:24:19,901
...but now I'm awake...

1000
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:25,101
...and I hate my dream.

1001
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:39,601
Maybe it's time I started thinking
about doing something else.

1002
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,700
Maybe someplace else too.

1003
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,200
Seems like every day I'm finding
something new I like about Gail.

1004
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,700
I keep workin' my points
about us gettin' out of New York...

1005
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,000
...going to live in the Bahamas together,
permanent.

1006
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,200
She ain't sayin' much, but...

1007
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,900
...I can tell the idea is growin' on her.

1008
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,499
Money's comin' in steady now. It won't
be much longer till I got what I need.

1009
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:21,899
This dream of mine, it's so close...

1010
01:25:22,599 --> 01:25:24,199
...I can touch it.

1011
01:25:27,599 --> 01:25:30,799
- Where you going? Wait, no.
- I'm tired.

1012
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,299
- I'm an old man. I need a rockin' chair.
- Come on! Please!

1013
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:37,499
Let me watch you.
I love to watch you. Go ahead.

1014
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,199
There it is.

1015
01:25:43,999 --> 01:25:45,299
I'm sorry!

1016
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:49,198
Look at that!

1017
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:55,298
Here's a bunch of us at the Copa.

1018
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:58,598
Everybody dancin', drinkin' Dom Perignon.

1019
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:02,298
Everything paid for by Kleinfeld.

1020
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:06,398
Won't even let you
put your hand in your pocket.

1021
01:26:06,398 --> 01:26:08,898
Always sneakin' off, payin' the waiter.

1022
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:13,498
But he has that bad drinker face.

1023
01:26:14,798 --> 01:26:17,698
His eyes are gettin' beadier
and beadier these days.

1024
01:26:18,498 --> 01:26:20,298
Should have seen it coming.

1025
01:26:20,398 --> 01:26:22,997
Don't stop. Please don't stop.
Look at that move.

1026
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:37,397
You're gonna let this fuckin' goombah
paw your woman like that?

1027
01:26:38,397 --> 01:26:40,097
They're just dancin'.

1028
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:44,397
Don't you appreciate that,
the movement, the rhythm?

1029
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:47,897
What I don't appreciate,
he's got his fucking hands all over her ass.

1030
01:26:48,797 --> 01:26:51,097
He don't have his hands over her ass.

1031
01:26:51,297 --> 01:26:53,497
I believe those are her hips.

1032
01:26:55,796 --> 01:26:57,296
Look at the shithead.

1033
01:26:58,196 --> 01:27:00,596
These wise guys think
they're so hard-assed.

1034
01:27:00,796 --> 01:27:03,996
I am so sick of hoods like that...

1035
01:27:04,796 --> 01:27:07,196
...coming into my office, my office...

1036
01:27:08,096 --> 01:27:10,496
...thinkin' they can push me around.

1037
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:17,596
You should tell him what you think.
Why hold somethin' like that inside?

1038
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:21,196
Why not get something like that
off your chest?

1039
01:27:21,296 --> 01:27:23,796
- It's a terrible thing to carry around.
- I will.

1040
01:27:23,896 --> 01:27:25,796
- I think you should.
- I will.

1041
01:27:26,395 --> 01:27:29,795
See how interested
he's gonna be in your comments.

1042
01:27:35,095 --> 01:27:36,295
What're you doin'?

1043
01:27:36,395 --> 01:27:38,595
- Are you outta your mind?
- What's that?

1044
01:27:38,695 --> 01:27:42,295
- Yeah, you, wop.
- Me?

1045
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:44,795
- You, spaghetti-dick.
- Wait. Okay, okay.

1046
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:47,795
- I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.
- You're talkin' to me?

1047
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:50,995
- Just ignore him. He's drunk.
- What'd he say?

1048
01:27:52,295 --> 01:27:53,595
Sit down!

1049
01:27:55,595 --> 01:27:57,895
- Who does he think he is?
- No problem.

1050
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:01,294
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Come on, everybody.

1051
01:28:01,794 --> 01:28:05,194
- Can you believe this loser?
- Let's go back to the table.

1052
01:28:05,394 --> 01:28:08,294
- People have no sense of humor.
- Let's go.

1053
01:28:08,694 --> 01:28:12,194
I was just fooling around.
I'd never let anything happen.

1054
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:15,794
Carlito and me, we take care of each other.
He knows. Right, kid?

1055
01:28:15,894 --> 01:28:17,094
Come on.

1056
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,694
You're a beautiful woman.

1057
01:28:22,994 --> 01:28:25,994
You don't get seasick on boats, do you?

1058
01:28:29,394 --> 01:28:31,193
- No, I don't.
- Good.

1059
01:28:32,993 --> 01:28:35,893
Just asking 'cause of our little boat trip
tomorrow night.

1060
01:28:35,993 --> 01:28:37,193
Just drop it.

1061
01:28:37,293 --> 01:28:41,293
Just tryin' to cover all the bases.
It's comin' up, you know.

1062
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:47,993
You two going somewhere?

1063
01:28:49,693 --> 01:28:51,693
No big deal. Just a little boat ride.

1064
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:55,293
Why don't you just let it go?
It's dull what you're doin'.

1065
01:28:55,393 --> 01:28:57,693
- What's the problem?
- It's just fuckin' dull.

1066
01:28:57,693 --> 01:29:01,093
I'm just askin' a simple question.
What's the matter?

1067
01:29:01,293 --> 01:29:02,993
You're actin' like an asshole.

1068
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:07,592
If a guy's goin' on a boat, you wanna know
if he gets seasick. It could be important.

1069
01:29:07,692 --> 01:29:09,092
What boat?

1070
01:29:12,392 --> 01:29:14,792
What boat are you talking about?

1071
01:29:21,592 --> 01:29:23,392
What boat, Charlie?

1072
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:42,791
If you ever talk that shit again
in front of her, I'm gonna kill you.

1073
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,291
What's the matter with him?

1074
01:29:53,391 --> 01:29:55,091
I don't like him.

1075
01:29:55,691 --> 01:29:59,691
- Didn't like him the minute I met him.
- You're just not listenin' to me.

1076
01:30:02,391 --> 01:30:03,691
All right.

1077
01:30:04,991 --> 01:30:07,391
So what is this boat thing then?

1078
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:11,690
What is that asshole
manipulating you into? Tell me.

1079
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:15,090
Just helpin' him out with something,
that's all. I owe him.

1080
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:16,690
You owe him?

1081
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:19,790
He's a fucking cokehead!

1082
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,890
I can't believe you hang around
with that guy.

1083
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:26,190
He's sick.

1084
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,590
He's gonna get you killed,
or sent back to prison.

1085
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,490
He saved my life!

1086
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:35,690
So now you have to pay him with it?

1087
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:41,089
Jesus Christ, Charlie,
you give me this whole song and dance...

1088
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:44,389
...about how you're out of that shit,
but you're not.

1089
01:30:44,589 --> 01:30:47,389
Song and dance? What does that mean,
"song and dance"?

1090
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:49,489
You're not.

1091
01:30:50,289 --> 01:30:52,689
Where'd you get that? From what?

1092
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:58,589
- Why'd you drag me into this?
- Drag you into what?

1093
01:30:58,789 --> 01:31:02,289
Why'd you make me believe all the crap
about Bahamas and paradise?

1094
01:31:04,489 --> 01:31:06,189
I feel ridiculous!

1095
01:31:07,589 --> 01:31:09,289
'Cause you haven't changed!

1096
01:31:09,989 --> 01:31:11,889
You haven't changed a bit!

1097
01:31:17,088 --> 01:31:19,788
What the fuck are you tryin' to tell me?

1098
01:31:19,888 --> 01:31:24,088
That my gettin' out is just some bullshit
fantasy trip I'm layin' on you?

1099
01:31:24,388 --> 01:31:26,988
Is that what you're sayin'?
How could you say that?

1100
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:30,388
How can you say that
when you know how close I am?

1101
01:31:31,288 --> 01:31:33,988
How could you say those words to me?

1102
01:31:35,188 --> 01:31:38,588
I gotta do this, just this one thing,
and then I'm out.

1103
01:31:38,688 --> 01:31:41,288
- I owe Dave.
- You don't owe him shit!

1104
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:43,988
You think you do. That's the problem.

1105
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:47,387
- That's why nobody like you gets out.
- You're not listening.

1106
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:51,187
Everything you learned
in the neighborhood...

1107
01:31:51,287 --> 01:31:53,487
...won't do anything but get you killed!

1108
01:31:53,987 --> 01:31:56,987
How do you know what I learned
in my neighborhood?

1109
01:31:57,487 --> 01:31:59,387
This is stupid what you say.

1110
01:31:59,587 --> 01:32:01,687
I know how this dream ends.

1111
01:32:03,387 --> 01:32:05,187
It isn't in paradise.

1112
01:32:06,987 --> 01:32:11,687
It ends with me carrying you
into Sutton Emergency Room...

1113
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:14,487
...at 3:00 a.m.

1114
01:32:17,087 --> 01:32:18,886
And standing there...

1115
01:32:19,886 --> 01:32:21,686
...crying like an idiot...

1116
01:32:24,286 --> 01:32:27,186
...while your shoes fill with blood
and you die.

1117
01:32:27,286 --> 01:32:31,986
- You won't listen to me...
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me!

1118
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,986
You're not listening to me!

1119
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:50,186
Dave is my friend.

1120
01:32:52,485 --> 01:32:53,785
I owe him.

1121
01:32:55,185 --> 01:32:56,185
That's...

1122
01:32:57,685 --> 01:32:58,985
...who I am.

1123
01:33:00,385 --> 01:33:02,885
That's what I am, right or wrong.

1124
01:33:05,585 --> 01:33:07,385
I can't change that!

1125
01:33:20,085 --> 01:33:22,185
Whatever he wants you to do...

1126
01:33:24,784 --> 01:33:26,184
...don't do it.

1127
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:29,984
For me, please, don't do it.

1128
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:33,284
Please.

1129
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:36,484
Just don't do it.

1130
01:33:42,484 --> 01:33:45,284
That's the last time I wipe up your blood!

1131
01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:52,884
Came the big night,
and right away I didn't like it.

1132
01:33:53,284 --> 01:33:55,783
Kleinfeld was coked out of his mind...

1133
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:59,383
...the flaps of his nose, all red and swollen.

1134
01:34:00,283 --> 01:34:01,883
Bad start, Jack.

1135
01:34:05,183 --> 01:34:09,183
- What's with the extra guy?
- This is one of Tony's sons, Frankie.

1136
01:34:09,183 --> 01:34:10,683
- It's Frank.
- Whatever.

1137
01:34:10,683 --> 01:34:14,083
- What is with the extra guy?
- Excuse me, is this your boat?

1138
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:17,483
Then shut the fuck up.
I thought I needed help, I brought help.

1139
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,983
We'll take the La Guardia side
through the Sound.

1140
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:24,183
Take the wheel when we pick up Tony.
Carlito, you help me fish him out.

1141
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,883
- It's Frank.
- Whatever. Cast her off.

1142
01:34:28,082 --> 01:34:31,582
- What's that?
- Untie the fuckin' rope, spic! Come on!

1143
01:34:47,382 --> 01:34:49,482
This guy a friend of yours?

1144
01:34:51,182 --> 01:34:53,082
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

1145
01:34:53,182 --> 01:34:55,182
He's a fucking cockroach.

1146
01:35:14,681 --> 01:35:16,881
All right now, take it easy.

1147
01:35:17,681 --> 01:35:18,881
I see the buoy.

1148
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:21,581
You see it? Where?

1149
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:26,881
Slow. I can't see a fuckin' thing.

1150
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:30,381
- It's right there.
- Did you hear what I just said?

1151
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:33,080
Would you slow down?
You're gonna run him over.

1152
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,380
Where you goin'?

1153
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,580
Jesus, fuck, you passed him! You idiot!

1154
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,180
Frankie boy, hold on.
You come up on the fly deck with me.

1155
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,180
We can't back it up from down here.

1156
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,580
Up here! Come on!

1157
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,080
Come on, follow me. This way.

1158
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,080
Help!

1159
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,680
Come here! Come back!

1160
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:06,579
Get outta the fuckin' way!
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1161
01:36:12,879 --> 01:36:14,179
Over here!

1162
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:18,779
You missed me! Over here!

1163
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:32,279
You see that light right there?

1164
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:34,679
Yeah, the light.

1165
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:37,479
Just keep the bow pointed
straight at that light.

1166
01:36:37,579 --> 01:36:40,278
- Can you manage that?
- I got the light.

1167
01:36:44,478 --> 01:36:45,678
Here!

1168
01:36:46,378 --> 01:36:48,278
- Come on.
- Over here.

1169
01:36:50,078 --> 01:36:51,078
Help!

1170
01:36:53,878 --> 01:36:56,078
Okay, got him! Stop it!

1171
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:58,178
I got him! Stop it!

1172
01:36:59,678 --> 01:37:01,478
- Hurry up!
- Okay, come on.

1173
01:37:03,878 --> 01:37:04,678
Help me!

1174
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:06,878
- You got him?
- I got him.

1175
01:37:07,278 --> 01:37:11,577
Take the wheel. We're starting to turn.
I got him. Tony, grab a rail!

1176
01:37:14,177 --> 01:37:15,477
Help me!

1177
01:37:17,377 --> 01:37:18,677
Help me.

1178
01:37:21,177 --> 01:37:23,377
You tell me how it feels...

1179
01:37:23,477 --> 01:37:27,377
...with the fuckin' eels
and the fuckin' crabs...

1180
01:37:27,577 --> 01:37:30,177
...comin' outta your fuckin' eyes!

1181
01:37:32,677 --> 01:37:34,677
What the fuck you doin'?

1182
01:37:38,677 --> 01:37:42,177
- Now, drown, you guinea bastard!
- Get the fuck off!

1183
01:37:43,076 --> 01:37:44,476
Help me get Frankie.

1184
01:37:45,076 --> 01:37:47,576
You killed us, Dave. You killed us.

1185
01:37:49,776 --> 01:37:50,976
My God.

1186
01:37:59,576 --> 01:38:01,176
Come on, Frankie.

1187
01:38:03,176 --> 01:38:05,676
Your daddy's waitin' for ya.

1188
01:38:08,376 --> 01:38:09,376
Come on!

1189
01:38:09,876 --> 01:38:12,976
Take an end, for Christ's sake.
We're fallin' out of position.

1190
01:38:13,676 --> 01:38:16,575
We're gonna stand you up
and say good night.

1191
01:38:20,975 --> 01:38:22,475
Get him on the other side.

1192
01:38:22,675 --> 01:38:26,275
One, two, three.

1193
01:38:42,575 --> 01:38:46,075
There's a line you cross
you don't never come back from.

1194
01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:49,574
Point of no return.

1195
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:54,574
Dave crossed it. I'm here with him.

1196
01:38:55,374 --> 01:38:58,974
That means I'm goin' along for the ride,
the whole ride...

1197
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:02,674
...all the way to the end of the line,
wherever that is.

1198
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:09,774
I had to do it.
He never would've let me live.

1199
01:39:11,174 --> 01:39:14,274
I know, you're pissed.
I'm gonna throw in another $10,000.

1200
01:39:14,274 --> 01:39:18,174
I'm gonna send over the whole $60,000
in cash tomorrow. All right?

1201
01:39:18,874 --> 01:39:23,373
It's gonna look like the kid tried to spring
the old man, boat flipped, they drowned.

1202
01:39:23,373 --> 01:39:27,873
Maybe they got their heads split
by a scow or barge just for good measure.

1203
01:39:28,073 --> 01:39:30,773
This is never gonna come back to us.
Trust me.

1204
01:39:30,973 --> 01:39:33,273
- You ripped him off, didn't you?
- Who?

1205
01:39:33,673 --> 01:39:37,173
Tony T. You did take the million dollars,
didn't you?

1206
01:39:43,073 --> 01:39:44,273
Yeah.

1207
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:53,172
You ain't a lawyer no more, Dave.
You're a gangster now.

1208
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:57,272
You're on the other side.
Whole new ball game.

1209
01:39:59,072 --> 01:40:03,972
You can't learn about it in school,
and you can't have a late start.

1210
01:40:05,372 --> 01:40:07,172
Don't worry about me.

1211
01:40:07,772 --> 01:40:09,372
One more thing.

1212
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,372
We're even.

1213
01:40:14,272 --> 01:40:15,872
- Let's get a drink.
- Say it!

1214
01:40:18,972 --> 01:40:20,372
We're even.

1215
01:40:23,472 --> 01:40:24,772
We're even.

1216
01:40:32,771 --> 01:40:35,071
We ain't never gonna sell these tickets...

1217
01:40:35,971 --> 01:40:38,071
...whackin' a boss and his kid.

1218
01:40:40,871 --> 01:40:43,771
These Italians, I work with 'em, I know 'em.

1219
01:40:44,471 --> 01:40:47,471
They will read this one
with their eyes closed.

1220
01:40:48,771 --> 01:40:50,571
I gotta keep movin'.

1221
01:41:33,869 --> 01:41:35,369
Most people will.

1222
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:43,369
You get old enough...

1223
01:41:43,469 --> 01:41:46,769
...you remember a reason
why everybody wants to whack you.

1224
01:41:46,969 --> 01:41:48,769
You believe 'em all...

1225
01:41:50,269 --> 01:41:52,969
...but you know somebody's gotta be lyin'.

1226
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:56,769
Or maybe they're all lyin'.

1227
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:03,268
When you can't see the angles no more,
you're in trouble, baby.

1228
01:42:04,468 --> 01:42:05,668
You're in trouble.

1229
01:42:11,268 --> 01:42:14,068
There's a Patrolman Williams on the line.

1230
01:42:15,668 --> 01:42:17,068
Put him on.

1231
01:42:18,668 --> 01:42:23,268
Mr. Kleinfeld? This is Patrolman Williams.
We're down here at your garage.

1232
01:42:24,068 --> 01:42:26,668
Your license plate is DK 777?

1233
01:42:26,968 --> 01:42:28,768
Yeah. Is there a problem?

1234
01:42:28,868 --> 01:42:32,668
Somebody tried to steal your Mercedes.
There was an accident.

1235
01:42:32,968 --> 01:42:34,968
- There was an accident?
- Yeah.

1236
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:37,767
- Is it badly damaged?
- I'm afraid so.

1237
01:42:37,767 --> 01:42:39,667
I'll be right down.

1238
01:42:48,967 --> 01:42:51,167
I'll be ten minutes. Come on.

1239
01:44:07,565 --> 01:44:10,265
Mr. Taglialucci says to hold that for him!

1240
01:44:25,764 --> 01:44:26,964
Wait up.

1241
01:44:27,764 --> 01:44:30,464
I can't talk. I have an appointment.

1242
01:44:31,364 --> 01:44:35,464
You were right about Kleinfeld.
He's a bad guy.

1243
01:44:36,064 --> 01:44:40,064
- Me and him are finished.
- I can't talk. I'll call you, okay?

1244
01:44:40,064 --> 01:44:42,064
Slow down. What is it?

1245
01:44:42,964 --> 01:44:45,663
- Am I on the outs with you? Is that it?
- Yeah.

1246
01:44:45,763 --> 01:44:48,063
That's crazy. What's wrong with you?

1247
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:50,863
I have a lot on my mind.
Can we please talk later?

1248
01:44:51,063 --> 01:44:54,663
I just wanted you to know
you were right about Kleinfeld.

1249
01:44:55,163 --> 01:44:57,963
- I'm sorry if you're upset.
- I gotta go.

1250
01:44:58,063 --> 01:44:59,663
I have a doctor's appointment.

1251
01:44:59,763 --> 01:45:02,763
- What's the matter? You sick?
- No, I'm late.

1252
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:08,363
- We'll take a cab. What's wrong?
- No, Charlie, I'm late! I'm late!

1253
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:13,963
- You mean you...
- Not for long, okay?

1254
01:45:15,863 --> 01:45:17,362
What does that mean?

1255
01:45:17,462 --> 01:45:20,362
I'm not gonna have a kid
who's not gonna have a father.

1256
01:45:21,162 --> 01:45:23,162
We gotta talk about this.

1257
01:45:25,262 --> 01:45:27,962
- Mr. Brigante, my name is Duncan.
- Oh, my God.

1258
01:45:28,062 --> 01:45:31,862
I'm here to escort you to Mr. Norwalk
in the District Attorney's office.

1259
01:45:32,362 --> 01:45:35,562
I got nothin' to say to him
unless I'm under arrest.

1260
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:38,962
Mr. Norwalk has a tape
he'd like to play for you.

1261
01:45:39,962 --> 01:45:44,662
Unless I'm under arrest, I ain't goin'
anywhere, especially without my lawyer.

1262
01:45:45,562 --> 01:45:49,362
Mr. Kleinfeld took a knife in the chest
at 2:00 this afternoon.

1263
01:45:52,561 --> 01:45:54,761
I advise you to come with us.

1264
01:45:55,561 --> 01:45:58,161
We may be the only friends you've got.

1265
01:46:00,161 --> 01:46:01,661
I'm going, too.

1266
01:46:02,861 --> 01:46:05,061
Kleinfeld's lucky to be alive.

1267
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:07,961
We're holding him at East Side Hospital.

1268
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:10,961
We want his ass healthy
when we send it upstate.

1269
01:46:11,561 --> 01:46:14,361
You're sendin' him upstate? What for?

1270
01:46:16,261 --> 01:46:19,961
David Kleinfeld became a very big fish
while you were gone.

1271
01:46:21,461 --> 01:46:23,460
Even bigger than you. He's dirty.

1272
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:28,160
Money laundering, jury tampering, bribery.
We've been after him for some time now.

1273
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,760
I don't know nothin' about that, so...

1274
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:35,360
There's a lot you don't know.

1275
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:40,660
Bill, you got no case here.
You know it and I know it.

1276
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,960
Chances are, you won't even
get an indictment.

1277
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:44,860
Wanna try your luck?

1278
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:49,960
Look, let's not both waste our time.
You said maybe I could help myself.

1279
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,060
- You're not taping this, are you?
- Gimme a little credit.

1280
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:57,259
All right. I thought of something
you might want.

1281
01:46:58,259 --> 01:47:01,659
You get off me, I'll help you put
Carlito Brigante back inside.

1282
01:47:01,759 --> 01:47:03,659
Brigante? For what?

1283
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:09,759
After he got out, he started coming to
my office and making a lot of phone calls.

1284
01:47:09,859 --> 01:47:14,759
I found out he was back with Rolando
Rivas, his old partner, dealin' coke.

1285
01:47:15,759 --> 01:47:17,659
And I'm talkin' serious numbers.

1286
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:20,359
Would you testify to that?

1287
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:22,759
Absolutely.

1288
01:47:27,758 --> 01:47:29,258
We don't believe him.

1289
01:47:32,658 --> 01:47:37,458
Word on the street is you've been clean
since you came out of prison.

1290
01:47:38,558 --> 01:47:40,658
Kleinfeld's the one we're after.

1291
01:47:41,258 --> 01:47:45,258
He was right. I'd never get
an indictment with what I had.

1292
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,958
But now, with your help...

1293
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:51,858
...we can put this filth away
for a long time.

1294
01:47:56,258 --> 01:47:57,258
Hermano...

1295
01:47:59,058 --> 01:48:01,157
...we know about Tony T.

1296
01:48:01,857 --> 01:48:03,357
Who's Tony T.?

1297
01:48:03,957 --> 01:48:05,357
Yeah, right.

1298
01:48:06,157 --> 01:48:10,657
His body popped up in the East River
yesterday, and his kid, Frankie's.

1299
01:48:11,657 --> 01:48:14,657
Somebody was trying
to bust Tony outta prison.

1300
01:48:15,357 --> 01:48:19,057
I don't know these people you mentioned.
I don't know them.

1301
01:48:20,657 --> 01:48:23,957
Tony T. Had another son
besides Frankie, Vincent.

1302
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:27,757
Seems Vincent went crazy
after those bodies popped up.

1303
01:48:27,957 --> 01:48:31,557
Let it out all over the street
that Kleinfeld set up that prison break...

1304
01:48:31,657 --> 01:48:33,956
...then killed his father and his brother.

1305
01:48:34,656 --> 01:48:37,056
We aren't saying you were
on that boat too.

1306
01:48:38,056 --> 01:48:42,056
But knowing your relationship
with Kleinfeld, that's a good possibility.

1307
01:48:42,156 --> 01:48:44,256
Don't you think, hermano?

1308
01:48:45,356 --> 01:48:47,056
I don't like boats.

1309
01:48:49,956 --> 01:48:51,856
All right, here's the deal.

1310
01:48:52,156 --> 01:48:55,256
If you were on that boat,
and I know goddamn well you were...

1311
01:48:55,856 --> 01:48:59,056
...testify against Kleinfeld
for first-degree murder.

1312
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,955
You'll receive complete immunity and
a couple airline tickets to the Bahamas.

1313
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,555
You wanna get even with Kleinfeld?
Here it is on a silver platter.

1314
01:49:09,355 --> 01:49:13,555
I would love to help you, but I can't.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1315
01:49:13,655 --> 01:49:16,755
I don't know these people.
I don't know what you're sayin'...

1316
01:49:17,055 --> 01:49:20,555
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. Convicted Dope Peddler...

1317
01:49:20,655 --> 01:49:24,555
...if we can guess you were on that boat,
how long before the Italians do, too?

1318
01:49:24,655 --> 01:49:27,455
What if they get to Kleinfeld?
They can twist his arm.

1319
01:49:27,555 --> 01:49:29,855
You think he won't give you up?
Think again!

1320
01:49:29,955 --> 01:49:32,755
You don't owe Kleinfeld nothing.

1321
01:49:33,155 --> 01:49:36,755
The shyster tried to set you up.
Bury you, Jack.

1322
01:49:42,554 --> 01:49:43,854
That it?

1323
01:49:49,754 --> 01:49:52,254
I wanna hear from you by noon tomorrow.

1324
01:49:52,354 --> 01:49:56,054
You think you're gonna sail off
into the sunset, asshole?

1325
01:49:56,754 --> 01:49:58,154
Think again.

1326
01:50:03,654 --> 01:50:07,854
You gotta do it.
They're giving you no choice.

1327
01:50:08,754 --> 01:50:10,653
You want out, go ahead.

1328
01:50:10,753 --> 01:50:13,653
You can turn around,
walk away, never look back.

1329
01:50:13,753 --> 01:50:16,453
I would understand. But I got a plan.

1330
01:50:17,053 --> 01:50:20,053
I got a way outta this.
Pull over here, please.

1331
01:50:20,453 --> 01:50:23,353
- What's going on?
- Just wait five minutes.

1332
01:50:25,753 --> 01:50:28,853
- Where are you going?
- Wait here five minutes.

1333
01:51:23,451 --> 01:51:24,951
What is that?

1334
01:51:25,151 --> 01:51:28,351
Tickets on an overnight train to Miami.

1335
01:51:29,651 --> 01:51:31,851
Nobody's gonna look for us on the train.

1336
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:35,151
We hit Miami, we catch a plane to Nassau.

1337
01:51:36,751 --> 01:51:39,351
- What about the club? Your money?
- Fuck the club.

1338
01:51:39,451 --> 01:51:44,351
I already got $70,000 in a safe. My friend
in the islands can float us the rest.

1339
01:51:45,051 --> 01:51:48,450
Let's do it. Let's get outta here.

1340
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:51,050
All three of us.

1341
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:55,750
We're runnin' out of time, babe.

1342
01:51:56,050 --> 01:52:00,250
The dream don't come no closer by itself.
We gotta run after it now.

1343
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:08,050
I know, it's not the way I planned it either,
but it is how it is.

1344
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:13,450
I'm gonna go to the club, get my money,
and I'm goin' straight to Grand Central.

1345
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:17,650
Train leaves 11:30 for Miami.
You're gonna be there, Gail?

1346
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,049
- You'll be there?
- I'll be there.

1347
01:52:21,149 --> 01:52:23,049
I love you.

1348
01:52:26,449 --> 01:52:29,449
- Just make sure you're there.
- I'll see you later.

1349
01:52:33,249 --> 01:52:37,149
Train leaves in five hours,
and I'm angling like crazy in my head.

1350
01:52:37,649 --> 01:52:42,849
Norwalk'll blow over. He won't come out
of the country if he can't bust me here.

1351
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,749
But he ain't my only problem.

1352
01:52:46,249 --> 01:52:49,049
Five hours left. Can I think of everything?

1353
01:52:49,149 --> 01:52:52,048
Cover everybody. Tie all the shoelaces.

1354
01:52:54,348 --> 01:52:56,248
Gotta listen to my instincts...

1355
01:52:56,348 --> 01:53:00,148
...like the one tellin' me that face
and that uniform don't go together.

1356
01:53:03,348 --> 01:53:07,248
Just one last piece of business.
Gotta look in Kleinfeld's eyes.

1357
01:53:07,748 --> 01:53:09,548
Gotta know for sure.

1358
01:53:18,248 --> 01:53:19,548
Who are you?

1359
01:53:19,648 --> 01:53:22,848
- Kleinfeld is my lawyer.
- Hands on the wall.

1360
01:53:29,347 --> 01:53:30,547
Go ahead.

1361
01:53:37,847 --> 01:53:38,847
Relax.

1362
01:53:40,447 --> 01:53:41,947
It's your pal.

1363
01:53:43,547 --> 01:53:45,547
Scared the hell out of me.

1364
01:53:46,647 --> 01:53:50,647
Cop's not supposed to let anybody in.
It's you, it's okay, but...

1365
01:53:50,947 --> 01:53:53,147
Cops ain't gonna protect you.

1366
01:53:54,347 --> 01:53:56,247
The mob is looking for you.

1367
01:53:57,246 --> 01:53:59,746
I know. Where the fuck have you been?

1368
01:53:59,746 --> 01:54:01,346
What do you got here?

1369
01:54:05,746 --> 01:54:07,846
- Where you been?
- How do you feel?

1370
01:54:07,846 --> 01:54:11,346
I'm not feeling very well.
Where the fuck have you been?

1371
01:54:17,046 --> 01:54:19,046
I've been to Norwalk's office.

1372
01:54:20,346 --> 01:54:21,646
I heard the tape.

1373
01:54:23,946 --> 01:54:25,146
That pig.

1374
01:54:26,546 --> 01:54:29,445
Never give up your friends,
no matter what.

1375
01:54:31,145 --> 01:54:34,245
They doctor these things,
play 'em outta context.

1376
01:54:34,545 --> 01:54:36,245
I can't believe you are such a...

1377
01:54:36,545 --> 01:54:38,645
Don't fuckin' do that! Fuck you!

1378
01:54:40,245 --> 01:54:42,345
What the fuck are you doing?

1379
01:54:43,545 --> 01:54:46,345
Would you fuckin' put that away?
It's loaded!

1380
01:54:50,645 --> 01:54:54,945
Fuck you and your self-righteous code
of the goddamned street.

1381
01:54:56,445 --> 01:55:00,845
Did it pull you out of a thirty-year stint
in five years? Did it? No, I did.

1382
01:55:02,144 --> 01:55:05,544
Did it get you acquitted four fucking times?
No, it didn't. I did.

1383
01:55:05,644 --> 01:55:08,944
So fuck you, fuck the street.
Your whole goddamn world's this big...

1384
01:55:09,044 --> 01:55:12,044
...and there's only one rule:
You save your own ass.

1385
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:19,744
Save your own ass.

1386
01:55:21,044 --> 01:55:25,344
- Save your own ass.
- See this? It belongs here.

1387
01:55:25,944 --> 01:55:29,544
Not behind a pillow.
This way you can reach for it quick.

1388
01:55:30,344 --> 01:55:32,644
They come in, you ready for 'em.

1389
01:55:34,843 --> 01:55:38,343
So long. You got a beautiful future.

1390
01:56:16,842 --> 01:56:18,342
Quittin' time.

1391
01:56:18,442 --> 01:56:21,542
- You're early.
- A few minutes. Finish your paper?

1392
01:56:21,642 --> 01:56:23,642
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

1393
01:56:25,042 --> 01:56:26,242
Be good.

1394
01:56:41,441 --> 01:56:43,941
There's a delivery for you, Mr. Kleinfeld.

1395
01:56:44,641 --> 01:56:47,541
- From who?
- From my father...

1396
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:50,041
...and my brother.

1397
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:54,941
Adiós, counselor.

1398
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:16,240
Where the hell you been?
You know somebody tried to kill Kleinfeld?

1399
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,640
I heard about it. Listen, me and Gail
are goin' out of town for a couple days.

1400
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:23,540
- You're gonna get married.
- Listen to me.

1401
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:28,140
I want you to go to Gail's house,
pick her up, drive her to Grand Central.

1402
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:31,040
I want you to wait with her there for me.

1403
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:35,240
Train leaves 11:30 sharp.
We can't miss this train, understand?

1404
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:37,440
You got me? Go ahead.

1405
01:57:58,839 --> 01:58:00,739
It's me, Pete Amadesso.

1406
01:58:00,839 --> 01:58:04,239
- Remember me?
- How ya doin'?

1407
01:58:04,839 --> 01:58:06,739
- Good.
- What're you doin' here?

1408
01:58:06,939 --> 01:58:10,839
We heard this was your joint.
Nice! Come by to say "hello."

1409
01:58:10,939 --> 01:58:13,339
Good to see you. How you doin'?

1410
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:15,939
- Good to see you. Yeah, long time.
- Long time.

1411
01:58:16,039 --> 01:58:17,838
Sit down. Have a drink with us.

1412
01:58:17,938 --> 01:58:20,138
Come on. Sit down.

1413
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:26,438
I said: "Shit, I ain't seen Carlito
in what, fifteen years?"

1414
01:58:26,938 --> 01:58:28,938
Fifteen. Yeah, gotta be. Sure.

1415
01:58:28,938 --> 01:58:30,938
- Long time.
- Long fuckin' time.

1416
01:58:31,238 --> 01:58:34,438
- Sorry. Joe Battaglia.
- My pleasure. Good to see you.

1417
01:58:34,538 --> 01:58:36,038
Sonny Manzanero.

1418
01:58:36,538 --> 01:58:38,538
- How ya doin'?
- Carlito Brigante.

1419
01:58:39,938 --> 01:58:43,538
Me and Carlito used to push
a little skag back in '57, '58.

1420
01:58:43,838 --> 01:58:45,538
Couple of fuckin' kids.

1421
01:58:46,038 --> 01:58:49,037
First time I saw this guy,
I thought he was Italian!

1422
01:58:50,637 --> 01:58:51,637
Look at him!

1423
01:58:51,737 --> 01:58:53,137
Shit!

1424
01:58:54,037 --> 01:58:57,237
Pete Amadesso walks into my club
just like that.

1425
01:58:57,837 --> 01:58:58,937
Bullshit.

1426
01:58:59,037 --> 01:59:01,837
There's an angle here. Pete's a made guy.

1427
01:59:01,937 --> 01:59:04,937
His uncle's a heavy hitter
with the Pleasant Avenue bunch.

1428
01:59:05,037 --> 01:59:08,837
What's he doin' here?
Probably Tony T.'s people sent him.

1429
01:59:10,237 --> 01:59:13,237
Maybe he's watchin' me, seein' if I break.

1430
01:59:14,537 --> 01:59:16,537
Waitin' for me to panic.

1431
01:59:18,237 --> 01:59:21,237
They still don't know for sure
if I was on that boat.

1432
01:59:21,337 --> 01:59:23,736
They think, but they don't know.

1433
01:59:24,636 --> 01:59:28,136
'Cause if they knew, I'd already be dead.

1434
01:59:29,636 --> 01:59:33,036
Right now, they just watchin' me.

1435
01:59:33,536 --> 01:59:37,236
He was always one of us.
That was a guy. That's who he is.

1436
01:59:37,736 --> 01:59:39,436
And we gotta know that.

1437
01:59:39,936 --> 01:59:41,936
So anyway, so I says to the guy:

1438
01:59:42,736 --> 01:59:46,736
"Tommy, Carlito ain't no fuckin' nigger.
Look at the way he dances!"

1439
01:59:49,136 --> 01:59:51,236
He dances like an Italian!

1440
01:59:52,436 --> 01:59:57,035
You should see him do the tarantella!
Waiter, get over here.

1441
01:59:58,135 --> 02:00:01,635
Bring these guys the best champagne
we got on the house.

1442
02:00:02,035 --> 02:00:04,835
- Where you goin'? Stay with us.
- I'm a workin' man.

1443
02:00:04,935 --> 02:00:07,535
Let me do what I gotta do.
I'll be right back.

1444
02:00:07,635 --> 02:00:08,635
Okay, buddy.

1445
02:00:46,434 --> 02:00:47,634
Motherfucker!

1446
02:00:51,634 --> 02:00:52,634
Fuck.

1447
02:01:03,633 --> 02:01:04,933
You seen the guy?

1448
02:01:08,133 --> 02:01:09,233
Saso.

1449
02:01:52,332 --> 02:01:54,632
- Where's my money?
- What're you talking about?

1450
02:01:54,732 --> 02:01:56,232
- Where's my money?
- I don't know.

1451
02:01:56,232 --> 02:01:59,832
You heard Kleinfeld got whacked,
so you figured I was dead, too!

1452
02:02:00,032 --> 02:02:03,432
- You thought you inherited my money?
- I swear...

1453
02:02:03,532 --> 02:02:06,531
Where's my money?
I'll cut your fuckin' liver out!

1454
02:02:06,731 --> 02:02:08,031
Okay. Okay.

1455
02:02:08,731 --> 02:02:12,331
It's in the box, under the register.
I was gonna tell you.

1456
02:02:19,631 --> 02:02:21,931
I want you to meet a good friend of mine.

1457
02:02:27,431 --> 02:02:30,431
You ever hear of Vinnie's father,
Tony Taglialucci?

1458
02:02:32,231 --> 02:02:35,131
Tony T. Yeah, he passed away recently.
Sorry about that.

1459
02:02:35,631 --> 02:02:38,230
I hear your Jew lawyer
met with an accident.

1460
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:41,030
I haven't seen him lately. What is this?

1461
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:45,530
I told you bring the best out,
you bring me this cheap shit?

1462
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:46,830
Come on. Excuse me.

1463
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:52,330
- Vinnie, slow down.
- "Ain't seen him lately!" The lyin' fuck!

1464
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:56,130
- Seen him in the hospital!
- We'll take him outside. Sit down.

1465
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,630
Relax, we'll get him.

1466
02:03:42,828 --> 02:03:44,728
Where the hell is he?

1467
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:58,828
- The little fuckin' spic bastard!
- Where you going, man?

1468
02:03:59,028 --> 02:04:03,028
- Nobody gets back here!
- Damn it, get the fuck out of here!

1469
02:04:09,628 --> 02:04:12,328
Come on, let's go. We'll get him outside.

1470
02:04:22,627 --> 02:04:24,527
There he is! Come on!

1471
02:05:46,325 --> 02:05:47,925
What do you want me to do?

1472
02:05:50,725 --> 02:05:52,424
I can't do nothin'.

1473
02:06:14,124 --> 02:06:15,824

You know, it is that way sometimes, papi.
Come on, let's go.

1519
02:15:25,107 --> 02:15:26,307
No, you stay here.

1520
02:15:33,107 --> 02:15:34,607
Don't try to talk.

1521
02:15:35,307 --> 02:15:38,706
We're gonna get you to a hospital.
You're gonna be okay.

1522
02:15:38,806 --> 02:15:41,606
Just hold on, baby. Just hold on.

1523
02:15:43,206 --> 02:15:46,106
Hold on, baby. Please, hold on.

1524
02:15:48,206 --> 02:15:49,406
Take this.

1525
02:15:55,306 --> 02:15:58,006
Take it and get out.

1526
02:15:59,606 --> 02:16:01,006
Both of you.

1527
02:16:12,305 --> 02:16:13,805
You'll be okay.

1528
02:16:19,105 --> 02:16:22,405
Don't leave me, Charlie. Not yet.

1529
02:16:23,205 --> 02:16:25,705
Don't leave me, Charlie.

1530
02:16:27,605 --> 02:16:28,905
Don't go.

1531
02:16:41,504 --> 02:16:43,404
Please don't leave me.

1532
02:16:45,604 --> 02:16:46,804
Don't go.

1533
02:16:50,504 --> 02:16:52,504
You can't do this to me.

1534
02:16:54,704 --> 02:16:57,004
Oh, God. Don't leave me.

1535
02:17:44,003 --> 02:17:45,402
Sorry, boys...

1536
02:17:46,602 --> 02:17:50,202
...all the stitches in the world
can't sew me together again.

1537
02:17:51,602 --> 02:17:55,402
Lay down. Lay down.

1538
02:17:55,902 --> 02:17:59,602
Gonna stretch me out
in Fernandez Funeral Home on 109th St.

1539
02:18:01,002 --> 02:18:03,502
Always knew I'd make a stop there...

1540
02:18:04,402 --> 02:18:07,602
...but a lot later
than a whole gang of people thought.

1541
02:18:08,702 --> 02:18:10,502
Last of the Mo-Ricans.

1542
02:18:11,902 --> 02:18:13,902
Well, maybe not the last.

1543
02:18:16,502 --> 02:18:18,601
Gail's gonna be a good mom.

1544
02:18:19,501 --> 02:18:22,501
New, improved Carlito Brigante.

1545
02:18:24,701 --> 02:18:27,101
Hope she uses the money to get out.

1546
02:18:27,601 --> 02:18:30,701
No room in this city
for big hearts like hers.

1547
02:18:31,501 --> 02:18:32,801
Sorry, baby.

1548
02:18:34,201 --> 02:18:38,301
I tried the best I could. Honest.

1549
02:18:39,701 --> 02:18:42,501
Can't come with me on this trip, though.

1550
02:18:44,301 --> 02:18:46,101
Gettin' the shakes now.

1551
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:50,600
Last call for drinks. Bar's closin' down.

1552
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:53,600
Sun's out.

1553
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:56,200
Where we goin' for breakfast?

1554
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,400
Don't wanna go far.

1555
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,400
Rough night.

1556
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:05,000
Tired baby...

1557
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,700
...tired.
