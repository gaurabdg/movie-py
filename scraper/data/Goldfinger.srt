00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:02,130
300MB UNITED TEAM - sunmenghao

1
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,140
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,970
Mr Romales and his friends
will be out of business.

3
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,230
He won't be using heroin-flavoured
bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,400
Don't go back to your hotel, señor.
They'll be watching you.

5
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,530
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but

6
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,790
first I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

7
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,070
Forgive me.

8
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,240
Why do you always wear that thing?

9
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,830
I have a slight inferiority complex.

10
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,000
Where was I?

11
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,750
Shocking!

12
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,010
Positively shocking.

13
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,210
Goldfinger

14
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,930
He's the man

15
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,680
The man with the Midas touch

16
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
A spider's touch

17
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,200
Such a cold finger

18
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,870
Beckons you

19
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,380
To enter his web of sin

20
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,380
But don't go in

21
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,310
Golden words he will pour in your ear

22
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,070
But his lies can't disguise what you fear

23
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,530
For a golden girl

24
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,110
Knows when he's kissed her

25
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
It's the kiss of death

26
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,380
From Mr Goldfinger

27
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,720
Pretty girl

28
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,140
Beware of this heart of gold

29
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,480
This heart is cold

30
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,240
Golden words he will pour in your ear

31
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,910
But his lies can't disguise what you fear

32
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,750
For a golden girl

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,130
Knows when he's kissed her

34
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,630
It's the kiss of death

35
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,640
From Mr Goldfinger

36
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,480
Pretty girl

37
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,570
Beware of this heart of gold

38
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,580
This heart is cold

39
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,920
He loves only gold

40
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,590
Only gold

41
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,850
He loves gold

42
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,940
He loves only gold

43
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,980
Only gold

44
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:40,250
He loves gold

45
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,470
One, two, three!

46
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,150
Who's over there?

47
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,150
- How's this?
- It's nice... Very nice.

48
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,530
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.

49
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,040
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

50
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,790
Felix! How are you?

51
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!

52
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,050
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

53
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,300
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

54
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,470
Man talk.

55
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,230
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

56
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,570
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.

57
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,900
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

58
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,490
Not any more, you're not.
Signal from London.

59
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,160
I knew M wouldn't book me into
the best hotel here out of gratitude.

60
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,460
He asked us to keep
an eye on him for you.

61
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,710
Auric Goldfinger.
Sounds like a French nail varnish!

62
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,220
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.

63
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,300
Big operator, worldwide interests.
All seem reputable.

64
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,470
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.

65
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,480
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.

66
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,730
And where do I find him?

67
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,990
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

68
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners every day for a week.

69
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,220
Morning, Mr Simmons!
Ready for our little game?

70
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,180
Sure. When you're ten grand
in the hole, you're ready for anything.

71
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,980
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!

72
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,230
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

73
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,820
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

74
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,910
Five dollars a point.

75
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,410
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.

76
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,830
OK.

77
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,550
I'll get back
and cable M you're on the job.

78
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,930
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

79
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,660
- Four.
- So soon?

80
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,500
How many?

81
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,750
7, 1 2, 18, 32,

82
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
44.

83
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,270
Miss?

84
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,530
Hey, what are you... ?

85
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,950
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!

86
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,030
Yes, I know.

87
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
You're very sweet.

88
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,220
He just drew the king of clubs.
That makes his count 59.

89
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,930
He's got a diamond run: eight, nine, ten.

90
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,690
He's holding on to the six of spades,
so I guess he thinks you want it.

91
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,200
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

92
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,200
He needs kings and queens.

93
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,710
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

94
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,900
Come on, come on!

95
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,570
That's more like it!

96
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,910
- What's your name?
- Jill.

97
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,490
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

98
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,960
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

99
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,710
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

100
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,720
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

101
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Just seen?

102
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,390
Just seen.

103
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm so glad.

104
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,070
You're much too nice to be mixed up
in anything like this, you know.

105
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,500
Now hear this, Goldfinger.
Your luck has just changed.

106
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,180
I doubt if the Miami Beach police
would take kindly to what you're doing.

107
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,060
Nod your head if you agree.

108
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Nod.

109
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,650
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.

110
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Shall we say $10,000?

111
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,070
No, let's be generous.

112
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Let's make it $1 5,000.

113
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
May I see?

114
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,180
Hell, I can see this is really my day!

115
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,350
Gin!

116
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,570
Over and out.

117
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,750
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.

118
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.

119
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,500
Call me James.

120
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,920
More than anyone I've met
in a long time... James.

121
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,180
What on earth
are we going to do about it?

122
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,770
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

123
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,770
Where?

124
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,110
Well, I know the best place in town.

125
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,100
Station WEDS brings you
the latest in world news.

126
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,520
Washington. At the White House today,

127
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,610
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...

128
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,780
That makes two of us.

129
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

130
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,970
- Felix!
- Well, now?

131
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
What's that? Dinner?

132
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,310
No, look, I'm sorry.

133
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,060
I can't. Something big's come up.

134
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,230
How about breakfast?

135
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,240
- OK.
- Not too early.

136
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,280
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

137
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,540
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

138
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,810
It's lost its chill!

139
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,650
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.

140
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,320
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.

141
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,240
Such as drinking Dom Pérignon '53

142
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,250
above a temperature of 38° Fahrenheit.

143
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,840
That's as bad as listening
to the Beatles without earmuffs.

144
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,220
Now... where is this passion juice?

145
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,610
Jill?

146
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,670
Yes, Mr Bond?

147
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,260
Beach 79432. Room 1 1 9.

148
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,610
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.

149
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,780
Get over here right away.

150
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,280
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.

151
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,290
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.

152
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,540
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.

153
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,480
Gold?

154
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,730
All over?

155
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,280
She died of skin suffocation.
It can happen to cabaret dancers.

156
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,780
You should leave a small bare patch
at the base of the spine

157
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,870
to allow the skin to breathe.

158
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,870
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

159
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,880
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

160
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,180
It's an assignment like any other.

161
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,180
And if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

162
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,390
008 can replace you.

163
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,730
You've hardly distinguished yourself.

164
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,570
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger.
Not borrow his girlfriend.

165
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,240
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe
and it's only thanks to Leiter

166
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,410
and my diplomatic intervention

167
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,420
that you're not being held
by the Miami Beach police!

168
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,460
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.

169
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,220
But I'm prepared to continue this
assignment in the spirit you suggest

170
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,970
if I knew what it was about,

171
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,810
sir.

172
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,730
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

173
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,490
I know it when I see it.

174
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,570
Meet me here at seven.

175
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,660
Black tie.

176
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,720
What do you know about gold,
Moneypenny?

177
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,510
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

178
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,180
You know, on the third finger
of your left hand.

179
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,940
One of these days
we really must look into that.

180
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,480
What about tonight?
Come round for dinner

181
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,650
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

182
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,990
Nothing would give me greater pleasure

183
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,830
but unfortunately I do have
a... business appointment.

184
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,830
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me!

185
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,590
Some girls have all the luck!

186
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,680
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

187
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,180
and kindly omit the customary by-play
with 007. He's dining with me

188
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,270
and I don't want him to be late.

189
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,940
So there's hope for me yet?

190
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,610
Moneypenny...

191
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,700
Won't you ever believe me?

192
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,620
We here at the Bank of England

193
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,540
are the official depository
for gold bullion.

194
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,750
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.

195
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,840
We know the amounts we each hold and
the amounts deposited in other banks.

196
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,430
We can estimate what is being held
for industrial purposes.

197
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,770
Thus, both governments can establish

198
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,190
the true value
of the dollar and the pound.

199
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,650
Consequently, we are concerned
with unauthorised leakages.

200
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,950
I take it you mean smuggling.

201
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,620
Yes.

202
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,290
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted
down and recast, is all but untraceable,

203
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,710
which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

204
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,220
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

205
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,640
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

206
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,890
Have a little more of this...
rather disappointing brandy.

207
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,690
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,

208
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,940
indifferently blended, sir.

209
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,860
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

210
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,790
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.

211
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,710
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

212
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,710
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas
and Hong Kong-worth £20 million.

213
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,140
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

214
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,020
The price of gold varies
from country to country.

215
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,400
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $1 10

216
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
and triple your money.

217
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,740
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?

218
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,580
Apart from being a legitimate
bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...

219
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,410
No, that's not quite fair.

220
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,130
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweller.

221
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,720
He's legally entitled to operate
modest metallurgical installations.

222
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,220
His British one is down in Kent.

223
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,640
We've failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.

224
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,610
And Lord knows we've tried.

225
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,740
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,

226
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,070
the bank can take action
to recover most of his holdings.

227
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,580
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.

228
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,750
Socially, of course.

229
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,920
I was hoping you'd say that.

230
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,420
It might lead to a business talk...
Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.

231
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,680
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.

232
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
This is the only one we have
from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.

233
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
But there are undoubtedly others.

234
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,150
Mr Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit.

235
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,570
Providing he returns it, of course.

236
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,780
It's worth £5,000.

237
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,080
You'll draw it from Q branch
with your equipment in the morning.

238
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,840
Of course, sir.

239
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,860
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.

240
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,030
This way, please.

241
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,330
My, we are busy this morning!

242
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
It's not perfected yet.

243
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,180
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

244
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,100
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

245
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,610
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5
with modifications.

246
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Now, pay attention, please.

247
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,030
Windscreen-bulletproof.
As are the side and the rear windows.

248
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,290
Revolving number plates, naturally.

249
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,540
Valid all countries.

250
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,130
Here's a nice little transmitting device,
called a homer.

251
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,800
You prime it by pressing that back
like this. You see?

252
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,680
The smaller model is now
standard field issue,

253
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,100
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

254
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,270
Its larger brother is magnetic.

255
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:48,780
Right. It'll be concealed in the car
you're trailing while you keep out of sight.

256
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,950
Reception

257
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,210
on the dashboard here.

258
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,050
Audiovisual, range 1 50 miles.

259
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,970
Ingenious, and useful too.

260
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,890
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

261
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,730
It has not been perfected
out of years of patient research

262
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,060
entirely for that purpose, 007.

263
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,410
And incidentally we'd appreciate its
return, along with your other equipment.

264
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,450
Intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

265
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,710
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear
that goes on out there in the field.

266
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,130
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour

267
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,470
if you give me
your undivided attention.

268
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,220
We've installed
some interesting modifications.

269
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,390
You see this arm here?

270
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,900
Now, open the top and inside are
your defence mechanism controls.

271
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,230
Smoke screen. Oil slick.

272
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,490
Rear bulletproof screen.

273
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,160
And left and right
front-wing machine guns.

274
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,410
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.
You see the gear lever here?

275
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,580
Now, if you take the top off,

276
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,920
you'll find a little red button.

277
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,590
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?

278
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,560
Because you'll release
this section of the roof

279
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,560
and engage and fire
the passenger ejector seat.

280
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,150
Ejector seat? You're joking!

281
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
I never joke about my work, 007.

282
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,910
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,170
An old member has dropped by, sir.
Same handicap as yours.

284
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,340
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?

285
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,680
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?

286
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,930
This is Mr Goldfinger.

287
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,940
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

288
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,700
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

289
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,330
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.

290
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,080
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

291
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,250
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.

292
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,590
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.

293
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,600
He's an admirable manservant

294
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,020
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.

295
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,270
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea.

296
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,380
This meeting is not a coincidence.

297
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,970
What's your game, Mr Bond?

298
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,520
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.

299
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,140
A 1 940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

300
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,980
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1 944.

301
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,310
When the Nazis were on the run.

302
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,320
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.

303
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,740
Interesting.

304
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,620
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

305
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,040
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

306
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,210
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.

307
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,390
- It's worth £5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!

308
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,560
Naturally.

309
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Strict rules of golf?

310
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,570
But of course.

311
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,750
Bad luck, you're in the rough.

312
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,520
What a pity. Here it is.

313
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,690
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1 .

314
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,070
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.
Five minutes are almost up.

315
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,320
A lost ball will cost you
stroke and distance.

316
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm still training him as a caddy.

317
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,770
Successfully, too.

318
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,440
Slazenger No.1 .

319
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,370
Good.

320
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,700
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

321
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,620
It isn't.

322
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,880
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

323
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,430
Why, you crafty old... !

324
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,600
Leave it.

325
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,940
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

326
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,270
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.

327
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,870
Like me to mark it or knock it in?

328
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,120
Play it.

329
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,460
- This for a half.
- That's right.

330
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,320
One to go, that will be the clincher.

331
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,780
Fine.

332
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,530
Did you switch 'em, sir?

333
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,450
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.

334
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,720
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.

335
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,630
Down in five.

336
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,470
I have to sink this to halve the game,
right?

337
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,060
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!

338
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,240
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

339
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,740
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

340
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,250
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

341
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,420
You must have played the wrong ball
on the 18th fairway.

342
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,670
We are playing strict rules, so

343
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.

344
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,690
She's a beauty. Phantom IIl, '37, isn't she?

345
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,870
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.

346
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,710
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths
have crossed. Let's leave it at that.

347
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,090
Didn't our first meeting convince you?

348
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,420
I see. You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

349
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,600
Both of us know perfectly well
what we're talking about, Mr Bond.

350
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,940
But I see that it is necessary
to remind you.

351
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,100
Oddjob!

352
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,860
Many people have tried to involve
themselves in my affairs.

353
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,120
Unsuccessfully.

354
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,060
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

355
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,310
Nothing, Mr Bond.

356
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,440
I own the club.

357
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,690
I assume you want the cheque
made out to cash.

358
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,200
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

359
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,290
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

360
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,630
I believe this is yours.

361
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,980
Can I have your attention, please?

362
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,570
British United Air Ferries
announce the final call

363
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,820
for the departure
of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

364
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,920
British United Air Ferries announce the
departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

365
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,760
Mr Bond!

366
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,770
I've got you booked on the next flight
to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.

367
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,890
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

368
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,550
Discipline, 007.

369
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,350
Discipline.

370
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,090
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.

371
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,260
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

372
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,510
You should've pulled over further.

373
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,930
Look at them!

374
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,520
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.

375
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,280
- How could new tyres... ?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.

376
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.

377
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,200
You don't look like a girl
who should be ditched.

378
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,700
Never mind that.
Please take me to a garage.

379
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,870
Certainly.

380
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...

381
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,260
As quickly as possible.

382
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,690
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

383
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,490
What's your name, by the way?

384
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,580
Soames. Tilly Soames.

385
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,210
Here for the hunting season?

386
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,210
I had a case just like that one.

387
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,720
It's for my ice skates.

388
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,390
Lovely sport.

389
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,230
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.

390
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,570
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.

391
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,950
There's a garage.

392
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,630
Fräulein!

393
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,640
I've had an accident.

394
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,820
How long will it take?

395
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,660
Thank you.

396
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,250
They say it'll take 24 hours to get
new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.

397
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,800
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

398
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,970
I hate to leave you here alone.

399
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,180
I can take care of myself.

400
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,310
Yes, I'm sure you can.

401
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,650
Well... don't forget to write.

402
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,610
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.

403
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,950
And art requires...

404
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,750
In this case, the bodywork
of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.

405
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,920
We dismantle it here.

406
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:11,050
Reduce the gold in this special furnace,
which in turn...

407
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,140
...weighing approximately two tons.

408
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,070
I make six trips a year to Europe
in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.

409
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,820
It would be wiser to suspend
your other activities.

410
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,700
Mr Ling, please assure your principals

411
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,660
Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided attention...

412
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

413
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,170
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!

414
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,340
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

415
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,100
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!

416
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,190
TM. Tilly Masterson.

417
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,110
I knew your sister Jill.
I know what he did to her.

418
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,190
No, you don't! Let me go!

419
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,700
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!

420
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,200
Well, you're a lousy shot.

421
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,290
But somebody else around here isn't.

422
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,370
Come on.

423
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,260
Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

424
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,480
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

425
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,250
Now!

426
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,190
Good evening, 007.

427
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,360
My name is James Bond.

428
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:33,540
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.

429
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,540
You have been recognised.

430
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,960
Let's say by one of your opposite
numbers, who is also licensed to kill.

431
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,300
That interesting car of yours!

432
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
l, too, have a new toy, but

433
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,810
considerably more practical.

434
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,650
You are looking at an industrial laser,

435
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,820
which emits an extraordinary light,
unknown in nature.

436
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,280
It can project a spot on the moon.

437
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,460
Or at closer range, cut through
solid metal. I will show you.

438
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,500
This is gold, Mr Bond.

439
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,340
All my life,
I've been in love with its colour,

440
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,130
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

441
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,480
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock,

442
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,560
which is considerable.

443
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,490
I think you've made your point.
Thank you for the demonstration.

444
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,660
Choose your next witticism carefully,
Mr Bond. It may be your last.

445
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,670
The purpose of our two encounters
is now very clear to me.

446
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,510
I do not intend to be distracted
by another. Good night, Mr Bond.

447
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,930
Do you expect me to talk?

448
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,190
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!

449
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,490
There is nothing you can talk to me about
that I don't already know.

450
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,000
You're forgetting one thing.

451
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,510
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

452
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,850
I trust he will be more successful.

453
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,860
He knows what I know.

454
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,280
You know nothing, Mr Bond.

455
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,870
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

456
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:22,110
Two words you may have overheard

457
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:27,120
which cannot have any significance
to you or anyone in your organisation.

458
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,370
Can you afford to take that chance?

459
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,440
You are quite right, Mr Bond.

460
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,530
You are worth more to me alive.

461
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,580
Who are you?

462
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,420
My name is Pussy Galore.

463
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,220
I must be dreaming.

464
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,650
I thought I'd wake up dead.

465
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,150
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.

466
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,410
I see.

467
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,170
I'm delighted to be here.

468
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,670
And, by the way, where is here?

469
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,430
35,000 feet flying southwest
over Newfoundland.

470
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,520
That explains the humming.

471
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,570
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's
Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.

472
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,070
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.

473
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,570
I never realised he enjoyed
my company that much.

474
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,330
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

475
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,500
Mei-Lei.

476
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,840
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?

477
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,510
Just a drink.
A martini, shaken not stirred.

478
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,680
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

479
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,850
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.

480
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,770
You are?

481
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,110
And just how personal is that?

482
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,620
I'm a damn good pilot.

483
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,780
Period!

484
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,370
Well, that's good news. By the way,

485
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,580
- Where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.

486
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,590
Thank you.

487
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,690
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

488
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,110
This should be a memorable flight.

489
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,290
You can turn off the charm.
I'm immune.

490
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,270
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

491
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,280
our port of entry into the United States,
in 55 minutes.

492
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,950
Mei-Lei.

493
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,370
I would like to arrive
more appropriately dressed.

494
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,290
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

495
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,550
And my attaché case?

496
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:56,720
Black attaché case damaged
when examined. So sorry.

497
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,060
Apologies quite unnecessary.

498
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,900
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

499
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,840
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

500
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,510
Do you want to play it easy...
or the hard way?

501
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,600
And this isn't a tranquilliser.

502
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,100
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

503
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,440
That's a Smith & Wesson .45.

504
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,530
If you fire this close, the bullet
will pass through me and the fuselage

505
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,700
like a blowtorch through butter.

506
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,870
The cabin will depressurise and we'll
be sucked into outer space together.

507
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,620
If that's how you want to arrive,
you're welcome.

508
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,790
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

509
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
That's very sensible.

510
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,880
And there's so much going on
around Mr Goldfinger,

511
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,180
I wouldn't dream of
not accepting his... hospitality.

512
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,020
He'll be very glad to see you, too.

513
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,610
You like close shaves, don't you?

514
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,870
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.

515
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,790
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

516
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,630
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal

517
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,380
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore,
where he's just landed.

518
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,720
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

519
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,890
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

520
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,980
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.

521
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,730
Registered to our old friend
Auric Goldfinger.

522
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,570
I'm glad he's making progress.
Keep an eye on him for us.

523
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,910
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky,
is their final destination.

524
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,540
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?

525
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,870
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

526
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,410
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.

527
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,580
Please.

528
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,660
Any time.

529
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,000
Thank you.

530
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,650
Do mind your step, Captain.

531
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,650
Just keep playing it easy.

532
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,330
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr Goldfinger?

533
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,660
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.

534
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,530
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.

535
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,410
Come on.

536
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,580
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

537
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:35,750
I believe the bourbon and branch water
is rather splendid here in Kentucky.

538
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:39,090
Well, now that we're both off duty,
perhaps...

539
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,930
Manners, Oddjob.

540
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,190
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.

541
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,610
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.

542
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,140
Well?

543
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,810
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

544
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,980
Your final briefing is tonight.
That'll be all for now.

545
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,240
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.

546
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,410
Lovely animal, isn't she?

547
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,080
Certainly better bred than the owner.

548
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,660
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.

549
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,670
Felix!

550
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:39,350
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

551
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,280
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.

552
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,280
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

553
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,180
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole
in his shoes.

554
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,270
Yeah, I like this!

555
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,110
Gentlemen!

556
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,780
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York
and the West Coast were in on this?

557
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,200
Look who's talking!

558
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,620
I do not do business with Chicago.

559
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,540
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.

560
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,300
Now I find I'm attending
a hoods' convention.

561
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,720
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

562
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,720
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.

563
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,230
And you owe me one million bucks.

564
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,110
I owe each of you a million

565
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,360
in gold bullion.

566
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,450
So, pay!

567
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:49,120
Gentlemen,
you can have the million today.

568
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,790
Or ten millions tomorrow.

569
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:56,130
Did you say ten million?

570
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:58,800
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.

571
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:00,970
Banks don't open on Sunday.

572
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:04,220
My bank will.

573
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,490
What's with that trick pool table?

574
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,800
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.

575
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,970
Turn those lights back on!

576
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,390
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

577
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,980
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

578
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:42,070
I don't like being cooped up
like this. What's that map doing there?

579
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,920
This is my bank.

580
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:58,600
The gold depository at Fort Knox,
gentlemen.

581
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,270
In its vaults are $1 5 billion.

582
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,900
The entire gold supply

583
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,980
of the United States.

584
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,900
Knock off Fort Knox!

585
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,660
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.

586
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,500
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

587
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
41,000.

588
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,340
And who's gonna say boo to them,
Goldfinger?

589
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,350
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

590
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:30,850
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?

591
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,340
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

592
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,760
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

593
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:59,020
He has fired rockets to the moon.

594
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,100
Split the atom.

595
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,190
Achieved miracles

596
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,690
in every field of human endeavour...
except crime!

597
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:15,260
The underworld
will applaud for centuries!

598
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,590
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!

599
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,260
It's pointless.
The depository's impregnable.

600
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:25,020
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!

601
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,020
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.

602
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:32,200
Larger, better protected perhaps,
but nonetheless a bank!

603
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:35,030
It can be... I think the expression is

604
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,500
blown.

605
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,500
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!

606
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,010
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

607
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,930
I have devoted 1 5 years of my life to it.

608
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,770
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

609
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,520
Every eventuality has been considered.

610
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,020
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

611
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,190
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,

612
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,950
brought a batch of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

613
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,700
They contain Delta 9.

614
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:07,000
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas

615
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:13,720
which disperses 1 5 minutes after
inducing complete... unconsciousness

616
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,840
for 24 hours.

617
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,600
Tomorrow at dawn,

618
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,440
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

619
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:26,820
will spray it into the atmosphere.

620
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,040
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilised

621
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,960
my task force,
which Mr Strap and his people

622
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,130
smuggled across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,

623
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:43,220
will approach Fort Knox
in motorised equipment

624
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,220
along Bullion Boulevard,
which runs past the depository here

625
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,770
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

626
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:54,480
This fence surrounding the depository,

627
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:58,160
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.

628
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,450
It will be dynamited!

629
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:03,870
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

630
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,040
How, may I ask?

631
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:10,590
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By
using your influence in shipping circles

632
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,140
to bring through customs uninspected

633
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,390
a consignment labelled machine parts.

634
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,310
All that will then remain is to descend
to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

635
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,570
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

636
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,070
If you have no objection...
I'll take my money now.

637
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,870
What's the matter, Solo?
Too big for you to handle?

638
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,930
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.

639
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:45,060
Excuse me for a moment while I take care
of him. Make yourselves comfortable.

640
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,790
- How do we get it out?
- That's the bit I wanna hear!

641
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,880
Yeah, it'd better be good!

642
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,780
Pussy!

643
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,110
Who taught you judo?

644
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,320
The gun you took.

645
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,580
The gun.

646
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,500
The gun, of course.

647
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,520
We must have a few
fast falls together some time.

648
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,880
Hey, Strap!
He's got the right answers.

649
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:08,760
You and me don't even have to be there.
The boys can handle everything.

650
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,530
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

651
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,530
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?

652
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:29,710
The gas!

653
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:57,290
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr Solo. However...

654
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,680
Mr Bond, I thought
you were resting in your quarters.

655
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,560
They are delightful.
But it's much too nice to stay indoors.

656
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:13,230
I ran into Miss Galore
and she suggested that we join you.

657
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,820
Mr Solo, Mr Bond.
Another of my distinguished guests.

658
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,070
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?

659
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,750
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

660
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,420
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

661
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:29,250
My plane will get you
to New York on time

662
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,680
with your excess luggage.

663
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,760
Allow me.

664
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,020
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.
You will be at the airport in a few minutes.

665
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:42,900
Goodbye, Mr Solo.
Some other time, perhaps?

666
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Happy landings, old boy.

667
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,080
I found him under the model.

668
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,590
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

669
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,760
So did I.

670
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,170
He's on the move.

671
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,960
Slow down, don't crowd him.

672
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,110
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn!

673
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,700
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.

674
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,560
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

675
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:04,060
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

676
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,550
Dead.

677
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,800
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.

678
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,970
Why would he do that?

679
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,270
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.

680
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:45,050
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will
make you a very rich woman, my dear.

681
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,510
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?

682
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,310
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

683
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:55,310
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

684
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,820
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",

685
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:01,030
and go back to nature.

686
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,700
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

687
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,960
Touts looking for racing tips.

688
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,640
There's another possibility, however.

689
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,760
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.

690
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:21,980
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life
in Switzerland,

691
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,230
if those gentlemen are his friends.

692
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,230
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

693
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:32,410
For their benefit, Pussy,
let's make him as happy as possible.

694
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:36,580
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

695
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,040
Certainly.

696
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,920
Business before pleasure.

697
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,740
He wants you.

698
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,260
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.

699
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,260
Mint julep?

700
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:19,100
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

701
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,520
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

702
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,610
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

703
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:28,700
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

704
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,830
And incidentally
Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

705
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:35,670
You are unusually well informed,
Mr Bond.

706
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:38,090
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

707
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,840
Ha! American motorists
kill that many every two years.

708
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:45,350
Yes, well... I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

709
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,430
$1 5 billion

710
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,190
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

711
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:56,700
60 men would take 1 2 days
to load it onto 200 trucks.

712
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,780
At the most, you'll have two hours

713
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:03,290
before the army, navy, air force, marines
move in and make you put it back.

714
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:06,590
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

715
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:12,850
Is the julep tart enough for you?

716
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,940
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank

717
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,360
but not to steal anything.

718
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,360
Why?

719
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,110
Go on, Mr Bond.

720
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,200
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory?

721
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:29,450
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...

722
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,710
But of course!
His government's given you a bomb.

723
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,300
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

724
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,890
It's small but particularly dirty.

725
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:43,890
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

726
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,770
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the...

727
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:52,570
...entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for...

728
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,740
...57 years.

729
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:56,580
58, to be exact.

730
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:01,130
I apologise, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.

731
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:04,550
They get what they want -
economic chaos in the West.

732
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:07,550
And the value of your gold
increases many times.

733
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,310
I conservatively estimate... ten times.

734
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,390
Brilliant.

735
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:18,150
But the atomic device, as you call it,

736
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,570
is already, obviously, in this country.

737
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,410
Obviously.

738
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:28,250
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

739
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,330
could be risky. Very risky.

740
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,130
On the contrary, Mr Bond.
The risk is all on your side.

741
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:36,430
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,

742
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,970
who knows where
it might be exploded?

743
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:42,310
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens
at New London,

744
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:45,150
Cape Kennedy,

745
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,190
near the White House.

746
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,570
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

747
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,740
You will be there to see for yourself.

748
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,960
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

749
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,770
Forgive me, Mr Bond,

750
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,110
but I must arrange
to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.

751
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:17,030
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

752
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,450
Very chic, Miss Galore.
Don't you agree?

753
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,910
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.

754
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,080
I'll join you both later.

755
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:32,680
How about it, handsome?

756
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,140
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

757
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,270
The new Miss Galore.

758
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:41,190
Where do you hide your gold knuckles
in this outfit?

759
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:44,280
I never carry weapons
after business hours.

760
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,450
Yeah? So you're off duty?

761
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,280
I'm completely defenceless.

762
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,120
So am I.

763
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:00,550
That's my James!

764
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,010
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

765
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,520
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

766
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,890
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

767
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:13,070
He's quite mad, you know.

768
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,370
Well, now. What do we have here?

769
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:22,210
007 seems to have the situation
well in hand.

770
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:25,290
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

771
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:28,880
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

772
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:32,390
I'd like to think
you're not in all of this... caper.

773
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,640
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

774
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:38,900
What would it take
for you to see things my way?

775
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,320
A lot more than you've got.

776
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,110
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

777
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,790
Isn't it customary to grant
a condemned man his last request?

778
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,960
You've asked for this.

779
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,600
Get up!

780
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,640
Certainly.

781
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,460
There.

782
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,710
Now let's both play.

783
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,590
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

784
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,390
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!

785
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,920
Speed: 220.

786
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,470
Wind check: westerly.

787
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:41,660
Champagne leader to Champagne
section. Commence dive... now.

788
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:52,760
Ready for Rockabye Baby.

789
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,840
Commence spray on countdown.

790
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,350
Five,

791
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:59,680
four, three, two,

792
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:00,900
zero.

793
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:48,090
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.

794
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,260
The baby is asleep.

795
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:54,100
I repeat, the baby is asleep.
We're going home now.

796
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,230
Out.

797
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:25,540
Good morning, Mr Bond.

798
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,210
For once,
you are exactly where I want you.

799
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,480
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.

800
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,980
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

801
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:45,660
Minimum offensive fire until I signal
bomb has been neutralised.

802
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:49,830
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

803
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,330
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.

804
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,260
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

805
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:05,190
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...

806
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,360
He's one of them, so is the girl.

807
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,370
I'll get her, you get the door open.

808
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,720
We're trapped!

809
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,810
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.

810
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,650
Don't be a fool!

811
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:05,900
You can be a hero, I'm not!

812
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,910
No, no!

813
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:34,460
Keep going! Hurry up!

814
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:56,700
What kept you?

815
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:58,960
You OK, James?
Where's your butler friend?

816
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,130
He blew a fuse.

817
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:05,550
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger
would've hit the jackpot.

818
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:08,140
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

819
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:11,560
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.

820
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:14,400
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

821
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:19,820
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

822
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,830
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.

823
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:33,420
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?

824
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,010
The President wants
to thank you personally.

825
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,560
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

826
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:42,730
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.

827
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:44,820
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

828
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:47,740
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

829
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:49,990
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

830
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:52,080
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.

831
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:26,080
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.

832
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:30,010
Well, congratulations
on your promotion, Goldfinger.

833
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:35,260
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.

834
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:40,100
You have interfered with my plans
for the last time, Mr Bond.

835
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:44,360
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

836
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,780
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

837
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:51,540
She is where she ought to be...
at the controls.

838
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,320
Pussy!

839
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,950
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.

840
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:49,460
It's no good.

841
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,930
Oh, no, you don't!

842
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,220
This is no time to be rescued.
