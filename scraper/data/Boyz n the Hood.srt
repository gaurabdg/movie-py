1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,584
Hey, man, fuck that!

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,088
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,425
- Fuck that shit, man!
- Let's go. I'll take my car.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,886
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,598
- Just pull up, just pull up.
- Get your shit ready, nigga.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,975
Damn!

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,102
These niggas here?

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,813
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,776
Look out, nigga! What's up, punk?!

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,371
Possible 187 at corner of
Crenshaw and Century.

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,625
They shot my brother!

12
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,279
- Tre, you do your homework?
- What homework?

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,490
- Yeah, I did it.
- Can I copy it?

14
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,659
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,955
- Did you hear the shooting last night?
- Yeah, I got under my bed.

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,832
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,294
My mama say, "A bullet
don't have no name on it."

18
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,798
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

19
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,675
They lucky.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,345
Y'all want to see something?

21
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,472
What?

22
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,058
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

23
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,358
Is that blood?

24
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,735
What happened?

25
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,613
Somebody got smoked.
Look at the hole in the wall, stupid.

26
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,908
Least I can tell my times tables.

27
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,745
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

28
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,248
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,918
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,964
...that took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

31
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:59,345
...that were given to them,
like the turkey and the squash...

32
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,767
...and all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

33
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,437
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

34
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,648
...to commemorate the unity
between the Indians...

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,609
Excuse me...

36
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,903
...the Native Americans.

37
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,783
- And the early English settlers
who were called... Class?

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,785
Pilgrims.

39
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,287
That's right, the Pilgrims.
Very good.

40
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,789
The penguins!

41
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,459
Who said that?

42
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,004
- Mr. Styles.
- That's me.

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,091
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,009
Because I'm a comedian.

45
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,639
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

46
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,017
Yeah, I can do that.

47
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,895
Very well, come on up. Instruct us.

48
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,822
- What's the basis of your lecture?
- What?

49
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,491
What are you going to talk about?

50
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,952
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,502
- What's the name of this place?
- That's Africa. I know that.

52
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,170
Right, that's Africa.

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,174
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

54
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,219
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

55
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,723
That means everybody's really
from Africa. Everybody.

56
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,225
All y'all. Everybody.

57
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,562
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!

58
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,817
Like it or not, you from Africa.

59
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,321
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!

60
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,532
Quiet.

61
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,367
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,245
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

63
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,205
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

64
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,376
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

65
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,546
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

66
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,216
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

67
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:09,099
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

68
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,226
It's just that...

69
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,895
Yes, go on.

70
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,357
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

71
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,070
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

72
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,740
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

73
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,576
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

74
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,872
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

75
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,583
That's none of your business...

76
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,920
...but I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

77
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,091
- Then you are educated.
- We gonna talk about me or my son?

78
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,926
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,263
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre
back in class on Tuesday.

80
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,266
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

81
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,104
- No. You won't be seeing Tre again.
- And why is that, may I ask?

82
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,233
- Tre is going to live with his father.
- His father?

83
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,613
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

84
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,452
- You tell her go jump in the lake?
- What was our agreement?

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,955
What did we put down in writing?

86
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,254
"l, Tre Styles,
being of sound mind and body...

87
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,590
...agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,970
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...

89
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:33,308
...I will go to live with my father,
Mr. Furious Styles."

90
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,812
"Signed..."
Oh, now, who wrote this?

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,108
"Tre Styles."

92
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,488
You have to work on
your handwriting.

93
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,962
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

94
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,218
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

95
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,012
Or in jail.

96
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,683
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

97
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,101
Can you understand?

98
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,025
Look at me. I'm serious.

99
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,487
I love you.

100
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,030
You're my only son.

101
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,191
How you doing?

102
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,696
- I'm fine. How about yourself?
- I'm living. That's enough for me.

103
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,242
Well, here he is.

104
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,042
- What's the matter? You can't say hi?
- Hi, Daddy.

105
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,588
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

106
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,266
- What's up, Tre?
- What's up, Doughboy?

107
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,603
Well, there goes your son.

108
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,443
You wanted him, you got him.

109
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,822
Why you trying to make this
so easy?

110
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,242
Well, it's like you told me:

111
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,954
I can't teach him how to be a man.

112
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,832
That's your job.

113
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,296
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

114
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,131
You staying for good?

115
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,260
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

116
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,722
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

117
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,515
You living here now?

118
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,312
Thank you, Reva.

119
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,023
Furious.

120
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,946
- Take care of my baby.
- He is my baby too.

121
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,158
You still collect comics?

122
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,329
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

123
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,540
- Tre, come here.
- Watch my stuff.

124
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,837
What up, Tre?

125
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,673
What's up, Rick?

126
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,303
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

127
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,849
When you coming to pick me up?

128
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,145
Listen...

129
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,190
...this is just a temporary thing.

130
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,361
When I get out of school, I'll get
a better job, a better place to stay.

131
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,697
Maybe a house?

132
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:18,909
Then you can come back,
and things will be better. Okay?

133
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,869
Okay, Mom.

134
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,039
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

135
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,670
- Love you, love you.
- Me too. Bye, Mommy.

136
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,340
- Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
- I ain't got no troubles.

137
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,718
- You got some troubles?
- Lawn trouble.

138
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,554
- Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
- How much?

139
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,932
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

140
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,352
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

141
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,231
- I can make more doing nothing.
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?

142
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,191
He work for his uncle.

143
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,070
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

144
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,447
Do what?

145
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,450
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

146
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,455
Boy, don't look at me funny if l
ask you to do something. Take this.

147
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,919
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

148
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,719
Damn, your daddy mean. He's worse
than the bogeyman himself.

149
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,848
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?

150
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,559
- Later, Tre.
- Later.

151
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,772
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

152
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,648
Shut up, fool. Yeah, there is.

153
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,735
If there is, I'll bet you Hulk
could whip his ass.

154
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,655
Yeah, later.

155
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,735
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

156
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,654
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

157
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
All right, what are they?

158
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,788
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

159
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,832
I gotta clean that tub?

160
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,208
Yeah.

161
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,506
Clean my room and water the lawn.

162
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,634
Dad, can I ask you something?

163
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,345
What do you have to do
around here?

164
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,521
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

165
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:56,942
...put food on the table and put clothes
on your back, you understand?

166
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,570
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

167
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,366
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

168
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,745
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

169
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:12,708
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

170
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,210
You gonna see how they end up too.

171
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,343
I'm glad you're here, Tre.

172
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,679
You're a prince, you know that?

173
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,973
Yeah. You're the prince...

174
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,059
...I'm the king.

175
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,022
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

176
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,691
So get yourself together.

177
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,069
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

178
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,428
Oh, shit!

179
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,842
Somebody must've prayed
for that fool.

180
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,013
- I swear I aimed right for his head.
- Should've blew it off.

181
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:35,809
Don't say that.

182
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,147
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

183
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,531
Man, where are these fools?

184
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,995
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

185
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:18,185
- We got a call of a burglary here.
- That was about an hour ago.

186
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,896
We didn't ask you that.

187
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,648
Yeah, well, I told you.

188
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,734
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

189
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,237
Just tell me what happened, sir.

190
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,072
Somebody broke into the house.

191
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,158
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

192
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,913
- You didn't get him?
- If I did, he'd be laid out here.

193
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,958
- Is there anything missing?
- No.

194
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,752
Good, no need to make out a report.

195
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,256
- Got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and Normandie.

196
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,427
Too bad you didn't get him.

197
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,222
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

198
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,731
Hey, little man, how you doing?

199
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,942
Go on in the house, Tre. Go on.

200
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,616
- Something wrong?
- Something wrong? Yeah.

201
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,455
It's just too bad
you don't know what it is...

202
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,001
...brother.

203
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,515
Ice cream man!

204
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,309
Wait up!

205
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,865
- What's up, Tre?
- What's up?

206
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,163
You ain't shit.

207
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,956
You just like your daddy.

208
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,460
You don't do shit and you
never gonna amount to shit.

209
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,756
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

210
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,135
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

211
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,305
- Is that it? I gotta go.
- Hell, no, it ain't it!

212
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,350
It ain't it till I say it's it, damn it!

213
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,978
Cigarette.

214
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:30,150
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

215
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,281
Where you going, you little fat fuck?
You ain't got a job.

216
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,910
Who's that little fucker
on my porch?

217
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,671
Oh, you're Furious' little boy, huh?

218
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,925
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

219
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,385
So tell me something.

220
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,388
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

221
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,889
I don't know.

222
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,101
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

223
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,395
Too busy shooting at people.

224
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,106
I heard what happened there
the other night.

225
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,737
He still got that same girlfriend?

226
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,447
Excuse me, Mama.

227
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:23,370
- Why do you always play football?
- Because that's what I'm gonna do.

228
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,955
That's right.

229
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,921
I heard Furious shot
at somebody last night.

230
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,965
- He get him?
- No.

231
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,596
Who is that?

232
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,766
That's my lady, homey.
Her name's Brandi.

233
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,435
She ain't your woman.
She's my woman.

234
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,979
- How, when she my lady?
- She's my wife.

235
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:53,108
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

236
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,904
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

237
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,364
Punk!

238
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,240
Faggot!

239
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,161
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

240
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,080
Get off!

241
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,584
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

242
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,671
- Where's my ball?
- Man, don't bring that ball.

243
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,885
Me and my daddy going fishing.

244
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,762
We ain't gonna stay long.

245
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,015
- Where's he live?
- He don't live far.

246
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,399
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

247
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,152
Y'all want to see a dead body?

248
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,030
Yeah.

249
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,450
Tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

250
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,286
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

251
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,957
I think it's a.357 Magnum.

252
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,167
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

253
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,129
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

254
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,216
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

255
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,434
It's up in here.

256
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,739
Damn!

257
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,867
It smell like a dog died.

258
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,831
- Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
- He stink.

259
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,542
That's how they smell after a while.

260
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,004
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

261
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,383
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

262
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,055
- Oh, man.
- Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

263
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,224
- Hey, throw the ball.
- You ain't gonna see it again.

264
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,853
Don't you know this is a dead body?

265
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah, I know that shit!

266
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,691
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

267
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,736
Throw the ball, little man.

268
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,988
I ain't gonna take it.

269
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,574
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

270
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,578
I got enough money to buy me
a hundred balls. Shit!

271
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,750
Man, I told you not to bring that ball.

272
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,424
Thanks, coz.

273
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,093
Yo, dog.

274
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,303
Throw the ball.

275
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,265
Shit.

276
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,434
Let's start the game, man.

277
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,524
Man, you stupid!
Don't have no sense.

278
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,819
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.

279
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,405
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell Mama.

280
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,117
Y'all leaving?

281
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,744
Hell, no.

282
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,788
Give me my brother's ball back!

283
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,333
- No, no!
- Come on, man!

284
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,421
No, don't say nothing.
They're just playing.

285
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:05,300
- Give me my brother's ball back!
- What'd you say, fat boy?

286
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,345
- Give me my brother's ball back be...
- Before what?

287
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,265
What your fat ass gonna do?

288
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,857
Yo, Rock! Give the little nigga
the ball back.

289
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,321
Stupid motherfucker!

290
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,991
I was gonna give it to you too.

291
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,504
Man!

292
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,513
Hey, man, I got a football.

293
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,807
I never use it myself.

294
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:58,187
- I give it to you when we get home.
- He ain't gonna want it.

295
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,856
His daddy gave him that ball.

296
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,817
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

297
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,003
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.

298
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,255
Give me the fucking ball!

299
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,719
Hey!

300
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,721
Hey, little man!

301
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,393
Catch!

302
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,023
Man, you sorry.

303
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,197
- I'm going to the store.
- Why? You ain't got no money.

304
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,408
I'm going anyway.

305
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:00,374
- So you a leader or a follower?
- I'm a leader.

306
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,711
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

307
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,088
Break it down for me. And, hey...

308
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,590
...think before you answer.
- I got it!

309
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:14,471
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

310
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:18,809
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

311
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,936
Stealing isn't necessary.

312
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,689
And the last one, I think, was...

313
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,026
...to never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

314
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,777
That right?

315
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,406
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

316
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,459
What do you know about sex?

317
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,298
- I know a little bit.
- Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

318
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,051
I know, I take a girl...

319
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,470
...stick my thing in her...

320
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,431
...and nine months later
a baby comes out.

321
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,062
You think that's it?

322
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,314
Basically, yeah.

323
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,195
Well, remember this:

324
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:16,325
Any fool with a dick can make a baby,
but only a real man can raise his kids.

325
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,750
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

326
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,838
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

327
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:34,510
...hanging out in front of liquor stores,
getting drunk, getting high.

328
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,807
Some of them was robbing people.

329
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,267
Some of them was
even killing people.

330
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,021
Hey, you remember
my friend Marcus?

331
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:51,026
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

332
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:54,446
...but I said,
"No, I'm getting ready to have a son."

333
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,533
I knew you'd be a boy.

334
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,207
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

335
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,128
So I guess that's why
I went to Vietnam.

336
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,046
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.

337
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,383
Black man ain't got no place
in the Army.

338
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,555
Damn!

339
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,021
Why'd you get it all over me?

340
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,648
- Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
- What?

341
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,736
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

342
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,251
Oh, damn!

343
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,546
Looks like they going to juvie.

344
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,342
No, man. They going to the gates.

345
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,849
- Yo, man, what happened?
- They were stealing.

346
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,563
Come on, Tre. Let's go, son.

347
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,386
Come here, Rick.

348
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,513
Come on, man.

349
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:28,017
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

350
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,645
There you go!

351
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,064
Want to learn how to barbecue?

352
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:41,405
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

353
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,074
- Give him to me, Ricky.
- Shanice, I got him.

354
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,868
Go on back to your friends.

355
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:50,164
- He's wet. That's why he's crying.
- He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

356
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,292
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

357
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,714
See? That's how y'all got that one.

358
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,385
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

359
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,846
I don't want a whole stack
of these around.

360
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,307
I'll be the one taking care of them.

361
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,060
- I'll put him to bed.
- Go on to Grandma.

362
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:15,397
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

363
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,691
And flip that meat over.

364
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,365
I'm winning.

365
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,827
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

366
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,874
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

367
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,335
That's just once. Let's play again.

368
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:42,257
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

369
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,927
- Yeah, I'm with that.
- Bust some spades?

370
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:46,720
Cool.

371
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,936
- Know how to play spades, Dook?
- Something like that.

372
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:57,147
I have something for you to suck on.
Here, cut that, G.

373
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,277
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

374
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,371
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

375
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,415
I bet I get more pussy than you.

376
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah.

377
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,794
You get dopehead pussy.

378
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,131
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass...

379
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,092
- Who you calling wannabe mack?
- You, nigga!

380
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,636
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

381
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,806
Fucking them dopeheads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

382
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,643
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.

383
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,813
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

384
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,274
They got AIDS and shit.

385
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:44,486
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

386
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:45,821
Thank you.

387
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,783
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

388
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,994
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

389
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,497
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
Hula Hoop through a Cheerio.

390
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,919
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

391
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,465
- Mark ass.
- Y'all trying to scare me.

392
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,722
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

393
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,432
Mark.

394
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,204
Tre? How you doing, baby?

395
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,374
- Fine.
- Good, you just in time for the food.

396
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,876
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

397
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,462
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

398
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,716
- Everybody's here, have a good time.
- Okay.

399
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,386
Oh, and Tre? Baby, do me a favor.

400
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:54,098
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

401
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,768
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

402
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,021
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

403
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,898
Okay.

404
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,491
What's up, Dough?

405
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,787
Oh, shit! What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.

406
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,580
Yo, what's up, Tre?

407
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:22,918
- What's up, Chris?
- Heard you're like Mr. GQ Smooth.

408
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:28,507
- Working over at the Fox Hills Mall?
- I get discounts on clothes, you like?

409
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,927
You look like you selling rocks.

410
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:36,265
- Tre, you be slinging that shit?
- No, I don't be doing that shit.

411
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:39,435
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

412
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,522
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

413
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,109
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

414
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:51,113
- That's what we here to celebrate.
- Yeah.

415
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,658
Damn, brother,
how did you get so big?

416
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,328
Pumping iron and eating, man.

417
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,081
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

418
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,418
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

419
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,255
Rest of the time I was reading
and writing my girl.

420
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,674
- Reading?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

421
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:14,178
I ain't no criminal. I can read, bitch.

422
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,182
Who is that, Shanice?

423
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:20,684
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.

424
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,812
He was best friends with Doughboy
when they was little.

425
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,315
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

426
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:30,277
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

427
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:34,323
- He go to Washington?
- He go to Crenshaw.

428
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,451
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.

429
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,871
Do he got a girlfriend?

430
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,332
Yes.

431
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:55,344
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

432
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:59,682
He fine, anyway. You better watch
his ass. Somebody might steal him.

433
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,687
All right, y'all, come and get it!

434
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:17,157
- Do you live here?
- Okay, girl. Sorry-ass niggas.

435
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,243
Come on.

436
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:23,539
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

437
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:28,377
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

438
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,213
Let the ladies eat.
Ho's gotta eat too.

439
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:34,675
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.

440
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,219
Oops. I'm sorry, bitch.

441
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,931
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
- Just playing.

442
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,934
All right, enjoy. And be nice.

443
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,439
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

444
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,860
- Hi.
- Hello.

445
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,154
So why haven't you called?

446
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,533
Just one minute.

447
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,588
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

448
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,424
- I know. I'm just taking my time.
- Oh, I see.

449
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,553
- You trying to run that game on her.
- Yeah, how am I doing?

450
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,431
Well, you're doing just fine.

451
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,975
- Except for one thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

452
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,435
She left.

453
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:27,895
What?

454
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,231
- Damn!
- That's all right.

455
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,902
Hey, hey, hey.

456
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,450
Ain't this a bitch?

457
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,622
Wait! Wait!

458
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,962
- Don't worry about it. I got her.
- Is she all right?

459
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,465
All right, G.

460
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,309
Sheryl! Come on!

461
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:14,817
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

462
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,736
You got some blow?
You got some rock?

463
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:22,324
- I'll suck your dick.
- Just keep the baby out the streets.

464
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:27,329
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

465
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,675
What up, punk? What up, fool?

466
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,681
Mark.

467
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,365
- What is that? Barbecue?
- Yeah.

468
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,877
- I know you didn't bring me no swine.
- No.

469
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,796
Mrs. Baker told me
to bring you a plate.

470
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:20,716
- Brenda, huh?
- Yeah.

471
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,054
She might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

472
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,390
Let's see.

473
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:40,527
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

474
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:46,116
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

475
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,243
I'm eating.

476
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,121
After you eat.

477
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,334
Yeah.

478
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,215
Yeah, real close.

479
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:04,927
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

480
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:11,475
Something wrong?

481
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,103
Nope.

482
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,488
What's the problem?

483
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,617
You're getting old, Pop.

484
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,870
- I'm getting old?
- Yeah.

485
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,957
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

486
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,668
- You older than dirt.
- I'm older than dirt?

487
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:42,089
- Yes.
- I ain't but 17 years older than you.

488
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,426
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

489
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,513
These cats are great big...
Just slobs, man.

490
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:53,517
- You know, bellies out to here.
- Yes. That's gonna be you!

491
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,979
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old, fat, juicy roll...

492
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,815
...double-jelly-roll belly. Right?

493
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:03,819
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

494
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:07,114
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

495
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:10,993
"Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar."

496
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:12,327
You think so, huh?

497
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:13,954
Yeah.

498
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:15,998
Wait a minute, man.

499
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,127
What's all this
about grandkids, man?

500
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,129
You using the rubbers I gave you?

501
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,424
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just...

502
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:28,177
I ain't ready for all of that.

503
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,846
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

504
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,349
Why are you sweating me, man?

505
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,311
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

506
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:38,729
What?

507
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,482
All right?

508
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:52,951
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

509
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,872
- You had some pussy yet?
- What?

510
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:00,501
- You had some pussy yet?
- Yeah! Yeah!

511
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,960
When?

512
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,004
- What?
- When?

513
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:09,718
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

514
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,887
Go on, sit down, now.

515
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:24,566
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and l
were kicking it up on Crenshaw.

516
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,236
This group of females
rolled up in a Rabbit.

517
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:32,408
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

518
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:37,204
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

519
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,873
Baby was fine!

520
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,544
Body was booming,
like right out of Jet centerfold.

521
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,589
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

522
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:51,635
She walks right up on me
and busts out, "Is this your ride?"

523
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,431
Then I say, "Yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?"

524
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:58,892
She says, "No, I want to drive it."

525
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,730
I say, "Can you drive stick?"

526
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:07,109
She says,
"I can learn if you teach me."

527
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:13,032
I go into mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a woody in my sweats.

528
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:17,953
I says, "Why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson."

529
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,956
She does.

530
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,126
About a week later,
I'm over at her house.

531
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,171
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

532
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:29,965
I walk right up to the door, man.

533
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:33,635
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.

534
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:35,471
Kissing, hugging, right?

535
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,640
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

536
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:46,148
Well, about 20 minutes into it,
Mom and Grandma's come home.

537
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,567
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.

538
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,196
Wanted to make sure she has
something for the collection plate.

539
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:58,577
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

540
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:06,460
She starts straight
towards Tisha's room.

541
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,884
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.

542
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,012
I call her once in a while...

543
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:22,685
...but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, "She can't talk right now.

544
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:25,604
She busy, doing the dishes."

545
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:32,528
- What'd you use?
- I used the number she gave me.

546
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,199
Why are you sweating me?

547
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,369
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

548
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:49,169
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

549
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,422
...you use something anyway.

550
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:58,053
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

551
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:04,560
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

552
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:07,396
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

553
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,735
Clean up that hair.

554
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,039
What's up, man?

555
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,584
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- What?

556
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:32,296
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

557
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:36,091
- Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

558
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,101
Guess what, man.

559
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,772
- Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
- Cool.

560
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:53,400
You know, man,
I never lied to my father.

561
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:55,277
Never?

562
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:58,197
Well, almost never.

563
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:04,244
Where's all this coming from?

564
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:08,832
I lied to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

565
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,460
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

566
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:13,629
Is you?

567
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,965
Well, technically speaking, I haven't.

568
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:19,510
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

569
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:24,431
...and sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

570
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:25,933
Why not, man?

571
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:29,853
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I asked you, didn't l?

572
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,107
I was afraid.

573
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:40,489
- Shit!
- Get off me.

574
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:51,542
- See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
- What you doing, man?

575
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,380
What you afraid of, man?

576
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:58,757
Of being a daddy.

577
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,469
Oh, well, yeah.

578
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,346
But I'm getting old now, see?

579
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,475
And now that I want to flap some
skins, Brandi ain't even down for it.

580
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:13,022
- Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
- Is that right?

581
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:21,113
Straight up?

582
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:25,367
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.

583
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:27,244
What's that?

584
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,538
All right, you got it.

585
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,207
- I don't see that.
- Why the silent treatment?

586
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,668
You haven't talked to me
in five days!

587
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,046
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

588
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:41,175
- Then you take the phone off the hook!
- Well, I been busy.

589
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:46,013
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lie like that!

590
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:50,392
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

591
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:54,730
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.

592
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,693
I told you about that. I'm Catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

593
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:04,698
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

594
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:09,745
- When you bust a cap on somebody?
- I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

595
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,247
Damn! God!

596
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:29,598
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

597
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:37,940
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

598
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,650
No, look at me. Right?

599
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,068
Yes.

600
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:45,239
And I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

601
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:49,118
So it don't make no difference
when we do it...

602
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:50,994
...we still gonna get married, right?

603
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:53,956
Yeah, but I'm going to college
before I marry...

604
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:57,751
...and there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

605
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:07,302
Bad shit!

606
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,472
- Shit, look at this.
- Oh, shit.

607
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,600
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

608
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:16,478
Damn, she got a banging ass.

609
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:20,816
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

610
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:24,194
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish...

611
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,323
- That shit worked.
- What up, baby?

612
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,702
So let me knock the stuffing
off that Egg McMuffin.

613
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:34,455
You got a phone number?

614
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:50,012
- You haven't even given me a ring!
- I ain't ready for all that yet!

615
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,681
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

616
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,190
- With your mad self.
- Don't touch me.

617
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:02,566
All right.

618
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:19,708
- You make me sick, man.
- I know, but I missed you.

619
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:23,212
I missed you too.

620
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:38,185
He still ain't fucked her yet.

621
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,029
You better take your ass
to the store with that.

622
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,782
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

623
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,119
No, that's not all I think about.

624
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:57,037
Yeah.

625
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,749
- Okay, hang on. Pop!
- Yo!

626
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:03,252
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

627
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,755
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

628
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:10,134
He say, how come she don't say hi
when he speak to her?

629
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,428
Yeah.

630
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:17,433
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

631
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:22,271
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

632
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,940
Then we have to do
that incest thing.

633
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,442
What?

634
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:31,030
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

635
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:33,949
Who this?

636
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,035
Oh, hi, Mama.

637
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:40,164
Yeah. Hang on, I got Brandi
on the other line, okay?

638
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,587
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

639
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:49,465
Tre, this is your mother.

640
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:54,803
I'm sorry, Mama.
Hang on for one second. Okay.

641
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,766
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

642
00:50:58,975 --> 00:50:59,975
Okay.

643
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:02,936
Hi, Mama.

644
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,189
"Who this?"

645
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,858
What kind of way is that
to answer the phone?

646
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,818
I'm sorry, Mama.

647
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:14,365
- Why didn't you come this weekend?
- I was cooling with Rick.

648
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,077
You can cool
with your friends anytime.

649
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:21,288
The weekends are supposed
to be our time together.

650
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:25,668
Have you thought about
what we talked about?

651
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,503
Yeah.

652
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,463
And?

653
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:32,132
I don't know yet.

654
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:36,178
Let me speak to your daddy.

655
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:38,847
Pop!

656
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:40,474
Telephone!

657
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Who this?

658
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:47,523
Hey, how you doing?

659
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:51,527
Yeah. Yeah, we talked about that.

660
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:55,531
Yeah, well, look...

661
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:59,535
I know you don't agree with me,
but I think it's his decision.

662
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,996
Look, I don't...
No, I don't think that's necessary.

663
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,668
Look, Reva. Reva, this is bullshit.

664
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,422
I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.

665
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:15,551
There's no reason for him
to come live with you now.

666
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,553
He's not a baby!

667
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:19,346
No.

668
00:52:19,514 --> 00:52:22,766
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?

669
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,227
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!

670
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:29,231
We have gone through this
a thousand times. I always tell him...

671
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,900
...use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber...

672
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:34,653
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.

673
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:36,947
Look.

674
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:40,534
Yeah.

675
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,371
- Taken off the motherfucking set.
- Hey, yo, Monster, man.

676
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:48,459
Don't be cussing so motherfucking
loud. My moms don't like that shit.

677
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,588
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.

678
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,089
Damn!

679
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:55,549
Darin?

680
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:59,470
See, now I gotta hear this shit.

681
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,972
Darin!

682
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:05,768
- What?
- Get them drive-by shooters out of...

683
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:09,938
Damn! Moms be fucking
with his ass without fail.

684
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,107
She ain't like that with Rick, though.

685
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,485
Because they got different daddies.

686
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:19,114
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.

687
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:22,701
- See that? I didn't get my turn.
- It's Monster's fault.

688
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:24,953
Come on, man. Fix that shit, man.

689
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:32,628
What up, man?

690
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,505
What up, dude?

691
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,215
Who that?

692
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,664
Anybody know
where Ricky Baker lives?

693
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,667
That's my brother! He live here.

694
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:14,169
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!

695
00:54:14,462 --> 00:54:15,838
Stop.

696
00:54:18,299 --> 00:54:20,676
Stop. Hold still. Be still.

697
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:21,844
There, I got it.

698
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,638
Yo, Rick! Get your ass out of there.

699
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:27,683
Ricky, come on out
of the bathroom, baby.

700
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:31,478
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.

701
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:37,776
So, what college you from?

702
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,029
I'm from USC.

703
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,698
You got to have a scholarship
to go to SC?

704
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,367
No, but it helps.

705
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,786
Can you hook me up
with a scholarship?

706
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:51,290
- What do you do?
- I used to play baseball.

707
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,042
Shut up, man.

708
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,712
Don't you know
the man's about business?

709
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,215
Move, nigga. Move, punk.

710
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:02,343
Move.

711
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:08,223
Y'all be the fuck quiet.

712
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,516
Hello.

713
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:12,311
I'm Lewis Crump.
You must be Ricky's mother?

714
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:13,729
Brenda.

715
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:16,357
And this is my other son, Darin.

716
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:18,067
- Hello, Darin.
- What's up?

717
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,235
Can I get you something to drink?

718
00:55:20,403 --> 00:55:22,738
- Coffee, water, soda?
- No, thank you.

719
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:25,616
We met at the game
against Washington.

720
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:30,704
I remember. That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.

721
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,539
- That's impressive.
- Thanks.

722
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:35,250
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?

723
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,961
Hey!

724
00:55:56,731 --> 00:56:00,901
I want you to know, we're interested
in you coming to the campus.

725
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:04,655
Get a good look around, you know,
a feel for the school as a whole.

726
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,162
Here's my tape.

727
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,504
That was against Banning
my junior year.

728
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:25,009
Man, we lost that year,
but I did pretty well in yardage.

729
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,887
They had the best defense
in the city that year.

730
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,602
Big country booty!
Big country titties!

731
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,313
- Boo-ya!
- That's what I'm saying.

732
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:41,608
From eating all that corn bread
and shit, I guess.

733
00:56:43,653 --> 00:56:47,656
Shit. Me, I go to college
just for the ho's.

734
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:49,700
You don't go there to talk to bitches.

735
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:52,161
You're supposed to be
learning something.

736
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,789
Can't learn shit,
talking to no stupid-ass bitch.

737
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,838
- Yo, check out that 808.
- Damn, that shit bumping.

738
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:06,842
What are you interested in
beside playing ball?

739
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:10,346
- Like, what you mean?
- I mean...

740
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:14,516
...what do you want to major in? What
kind of degree would you pursue?

741
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:18,062
I'm just asking because
there's a strong possibility...

742
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,190
...that you won't go into the NFL
after college.

743
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,692
Just a fact. It happens.

744
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:26,653
Yeah, I heard that before.

745
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,324
Actually, I was thinking
about majoring in business.

746
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:34,995
I got this friend, Tre, who's always
talked about going into business.

747
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,706
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.

748
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,750
What do you think?

749
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:43,837
Young brother, I think you can do
anything you put your mind to.

750
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,887
I tell you where y'all need to go.

751
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,350
Where they got more women
than anywhere. Fine ones too.

752
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,977
- Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
- No.

753
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:02,731
- Street races on Florence?
- No, nigga. Y'all way off.

754
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:05,234
I give y'all a hint.

755
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:07,403
Everybody's been there.

756
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,906
- Where?
- Where, nigga? Spit it out!

757
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,908
The church.

758
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:15,244
Oh, shit!

759
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:20,374
Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going
to church to catch no bitches.

760
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:24,586
I should roll your ass up off
this porch for that stupid shit.

761
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:29,216
So basically you have
a 2.3 overall GPA...

762
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,510
...according to the classes
we require.

763
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,096
All you have to do
is take the SAT test.

764
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,098
Yeah.

765
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:38,434
I heard about that test.

766
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:42,062
The next one's being offered,
let's see...

767
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:44,898
...early October.
Are you gonna take it?

768
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,943
I guess so. I can't get into
college without it, right?

769
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:52,114
Just remember, all you have
to do is get over a 700.

770
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:55,451
- Okay.
- Come here. Come here!

771
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,080
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give
him a bath. Come here.

772
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,625
Your little brother?

773
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,295
No, that's my son.

774
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:13,635
Well, I'll look forward
to talking to you again.

775
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,347
We'll also arrange that tour for you.

776
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,182
Thank you, Mr. Crump.

777
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:21,310
You bet, Ricky. Bye-bye.

778
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:29,651
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.

779
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:32,821
- Man, shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you, nigga.

780
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:35,491
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb-ass home.

781
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,619
My baby is going to a university.

782
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:43,666
I always knew you would
amount to something.

783
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,334
I did.

784
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:50,172
When you were little, you used to
always run around with that football.

785
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:53,676
I'm proud of you, baby.

786
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,804
- Thanks, Mama.
- You make your mama proud.

787
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:02,685
May I have your attention?

788
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:06,647
The SAT test will be
administered in this room.

789
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:11,193
When you receive your test book,
please keep it closed on your desk.

790
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,530
Read the directions on the
front cover of your test book.

791
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:18,158
Use a number two pencil in
marking your answer sheet.

792
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:21,620
Ink or ballpoint pen
is not to be used.

793
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,708
If you do not have
a number two pencil with you...

794
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:30,379
...raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil out to you.

795
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:35,050
During the time allotted for a section,
you may work on that section only.

796
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:37,886
If you finish a section
before time is called...

797
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:42,891
...you may not go back to a previous
section or on to the next one.

798
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:45,728
You have 30 minutes
for section one.

799
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:49,565
Open your test books and begin work.

800
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,626
- This it?
- Yeah.

801
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:03,472
Damn!

802
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:06,475
Baby got more cakes
than Duncan Hines!

803
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:07,976
Damn.

804
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,939
Bet you bite a chip.

805
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:17,319
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

806
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:20,489
- "Furious Styles Financial."
- Talk to you later.

807
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:28,997
So how you guys think
you did on the test?

808
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,834
All right, I guess.

809
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:39,383
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.

810
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:44,763
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.

811
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:46,974
Came to see you.

812
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,810
See how you doing.
How's business going?

813
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:54,064
Well, there's always business,
just not always in here.

814
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:55,524
What do you do, Furious?

815
01:02:56,192 --> 01:02:58,819
You help people get money
for homes or what?

816
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:03,198
Well, there is no "or what."
That's what I do, Rick.

817
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,414
- You boys want to see something?
- Do we have a choice?

818
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,294
No.

819
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,253
I don't know about all this. Got us
walking around Compton and all.

820
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,090
Rick, it's the '90s.

821
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:04,343
We can't afford to be afraid
of our own people anymore.

822
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,140
Would you two knuckleheads
come on?

823
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:19,066
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?

824
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:22,903
"Cash for your home."
You know what that is?

825
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:25,989
- It's a billboard.
- Billboard.

826
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:27,991
What are y'all, Amos and Andy?

827
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:30,119
Are you Steppin' and he's Fetchit?

828
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,122
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.

829
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,958
It's called "gentrification."

830
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:40,421
It's what happens when property value
of a certain area is brought down.

831
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:42,673
- You listening?
- Yeah.

832
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:46,677
They bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.

833
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:50,973
Then they move the people out,
raise the value and sell it at a profit.

834
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:56,437
What we need to do is keep
everything in our neighborhood black.

835
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:58,397
Black-owned with black money.

836
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:02,443
Just like the Jews, the Italians,
the Mexicans and the Koreans do.

837
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:06,113
Ain't nobody from outside bringing
down the property value.

838
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:07,656
It's these folk!

839
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,453
Shooting each other and selling
that crack rock and shit.

840
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:14,705
How you think crack
gets into the country?

841
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:18,792
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.

842
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,838
We are not the people who are flying
and floating that shit in here.

843
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:27,051
Every time you turn on a TV,
that's what you see.

844
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:31,180
Black people selling the rock,
pushing the rock. Yeah, I know.

845
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:34,016
It wasn't a problem
when it was here.

846
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:36,435
Wasn't a problem
until it was in Iowa...

847
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:39,855
...and on Wall Street where
there's hardly any black people.

848
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,524
If you want to talk about guns...

849
01:05:42,817 --> 01:05:45,944
...why is it that there's a gun shop
on every corner here?

850
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:48,447
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

851
01:05:48,698 --> 01:05:52,826
Same reason there's a liquor store on
every corner in the black community.

852
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,245
Why? They want us
to kill ourselves.

853
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:58,374
You go out to Beverly Hills,
you don't see that shit.

854
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,668
They want to us to kill ourselves.

855
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:05,506
The best way to destroy a people is to
take away their ability to reproduce.

856
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:10,177
Who is it that's dying out here on
these streets every night? Y'all.

857
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:13,847
- Yeah.
- Young brothers like yourselves.

858
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:17,518
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?

859
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,854
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker
if he don't kill me first.

860
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,357
You doing exactly
what they want you to do.

861
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:27,027
You have to think, young brother,
about your future.

862
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:31,240
Damn, man.
You know, Furious is deep.

863
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:36,078
- He used to be a preacher?
- He ain't never been no preacher.

864
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:38,080
Just reads a lot.

865
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,084
My brother should've
heard that, man.

866
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,420
Would've done him some good.

867
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:45,754
Where he at?

868
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:50,759
Where else, man? Up on Crenshaw
with the rest of them fools.

869
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,303
- Let's go.
- Cool.

870
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,291
- What up, Monster?
- What up, nigga?

871
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,668
Goddamn, there's a lot
of motherfuckers here.

872
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:26,628
Don't be using God's name in vain.

873
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:28,422
What?

874
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:29,798
Man, shut up.

875
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,301
Yo, man, you believe in God?

876
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:36,555
Yo, why the fuck y'all get
so damn religi-fied lately?

877
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:38,640
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.

878
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:42,478
This is an A and B conversation.
You can see your way out of it.

879
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,813
You can see your way out
of my ride...

880
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:47,816
...and we'll see your crippled ass
walking home.

881
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:51,570
Man, look. Do I believe in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.

882
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:55,282
How else can you have the sun,
moon and stars and shit like that?

883
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:59,995
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.

884
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:01,830
There ain't no God.

885
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:06,585
If there was a God, why he be letting
motherfuckers get smoked?

886
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:12,132
- Babies and little kids, tell me that.
- You tell me this, nigga.

887
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:15,844
How you know God's a he? He could
be a she. You don't know that.

888
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:19,890
For one thing, you don't know what
the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.

889
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,351
I read about this shit
when I was in the pen.

890
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:26,522
It was this book, right,
and it was telling...

891
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:29,858
...life in the perspective
if God was a bitch.

892
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:35,197
Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't
be no nuclear bombs, no wars...

893
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,366
...because that ain't
in a bitch's nature.

894
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:42,204
Why every time you talk about
a female you say "bitch" or "ho"?

895
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,873
- Because that's what you are.
- Nigga, fuck you.

896
01:08:53,883 --> 01:08:55,009
Hey, hey.

897
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:56,218
What's up?

898
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:57,845
What up, D?

899
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:17,656
- What's up, Mon?
- What's up, Rick? Tre.

900
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:21,869
What's happening?

901
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:24,371
- Where y'all coming from?
- Compton.

902
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:26,206
What y'all doing over here, man?

903
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:31,211
We're kicking it. Philosophizing
on God, church, bitches and all.

904
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,923
I'm schooling these niggas
on the aspect of religion.

905
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:38,218
- Religion?
- And on factual, actual studies.

906
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,304
You know what I'm saying?

907
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:42,264
- Y'all coming from Compton?
- Yeah.

908
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:46,935
- Thought you were scared of Compton.
- Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.

909
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:50,230
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.

910
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,776
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.

911
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:58,280
Your pops is like
motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.

912
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:13,462
Man, what's wrong with you?

913
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:17,132
Fuck you looking at, nigga?

914
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:19,968
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!

915
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:22,471
We got a problem here?

916
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:27,101
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?

917
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,019
- What up with this?
- Put the gun away.

918
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,939
Can't we have one night
where nobody gets shot?

919
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:35,818
- Shut up, bitch.
- Bitch, I will fuck you up!

920
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:39,154
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.

921
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:56,547
Ferris always trying
to start some shit.

922
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:01,301
Nigga can't fight, so he always trying
to find an excuse to shoot somebody.

923
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:04,304
That's why fools be getting
shot all the time.

924
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:08,058
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.

925
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:10,894
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.

926
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,187
I know.

927
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:36,086
Hey, man, come on. Let's go!

928
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:45,304
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.

929
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:48,223
Fuck this shit. Fuck it.

930
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:52,561
You can't go nowhere without
it getting all shot up and shit.

931
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:58,192
Shit!

932
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,361
Shit! Fuck!

933
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,037
Driver! Put your hands
on the steering wheel!

934
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:31,850
- Got any drugs or weapons on you?
- No.

935
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:35,979
I didn't do nothing.

936
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:39,733
You think you tough.

937
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:42,653
You think you're tough, huh?

938
01:12:46,616 --> 01:12:48,492
You scared now, huh?

939
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:52,871
I like that. That's why I took this job.

940
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,625
I hate little motherfuckers like you.

941
01:12:58,503 --> 01:13:02,798
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?

942
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:07,136
I could blow your head off,
and you couldn't do shit.

943
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:09,763
How you feel now?

944
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:12,683
What set you from?

945
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,937
Look like one of them
Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.

946
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:20,816
No, you probably one of them
Rolling 60s, huh?

947
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:26,321
12-Adam-63, we have
a possible 187 in blue ...

948
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:28,991
...at corner of
Florence and Vermont.

949
01:13:30,618 --> 01:13:35,497
Again, a possible 187 in blue 
at corner of Florence and Vermont.

950
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:36,707
Stay out of trouble.

951
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,003
You gentlemen have
a nice evening now, you hear?

952
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:13,994
Hi.

953
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:19,833
- I thought something happened to you.
- Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

954
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:24,380
I'm tired of hearing them
shooting all the time.

955
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,053
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

956
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,891
I'm tired of this shit.

957
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:39,478
Those two motherfuckers.

958
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:42,981
I could kill all these motherfuckers.

959
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,067
I'm sick and fucking tired
of this shit!

960
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:47,069
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

961
01:14:47,278 --> 01:14:50,781
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!

962
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:54,618
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you! Fuck you!

963
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,789
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!

964
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,961
What's so funny?

965
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:51,967
I never thought I'd be crying
in front of a female.

966
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,638
You can cry in front of me.

967
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,628
What do you think about...

968
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:30,964
...people getting married
while they're still in college?

969
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:34,176
Are you trying to ask me something?

970
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:35,803
No.

971
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:40,182
I just wanted to know what you thought
about that kind of situation.

972
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:46,647
I think it can be good
if two people really love each other.

973
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:49,358
Really?

974
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:51,402
Yeah.

975
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:57,241
You sure you're down for this?

976
01:16:57,909 --> 01:16:59,827
Yeah. Are you?

977
01:17:00,036 --> 01:17:01,203
Yeah.

978
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:05,040
I mean, yes, I am.

979
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,715
I don't want to get pregnant.

980
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:14,758
You won't.

981
01:17:50,962 --> 01:17:53,213
Hi. I'm looking for
a Miss Devereaux?

982
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,883
- She's right over there.
- Thank you.

983
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:07,394
- Hey.
- Hi.

984
01:18:11,941 --> 01:18:13,400
You look nice.

985
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,694
Thank you. So do you.

986
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,112
Thanks.

987
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:18,822
Thanks for coming.

988
01:18:19,991 --> 01:18:21,116
So...

989
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:24,078
So this is...

990
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:26,121
...definitely you.

991
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,918
And what's that supposed to mean?

992
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:34,004
I thought we were
gonna talk about Tre.

993
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:37,966
Espresso, please.

994
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:39,927
Caf au lait, please.

995
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:45,724
I bought him some shoes yesterday.

996
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:48,477
Why are you always
buying him stuff?

997
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:51,355
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?

998
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:55,526
Yes, but he has a job. You don't
have to always buy him stuff.

999
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,027
Look...

1000
01:18:57,487 --> 01:18:59,988
...did he tell you he wants
to move in with Brandi?

1001
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:02,157
Yeah. So?

1002
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,993
"Yeah. So?"

1003
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:08,247
So don't you think that's a bad idea?

1004
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:17,506
I think that Tre is old enough
to make his own decisions, Reva.

1005
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:22,678
You're his father. That means you
were supposed to guide his decisions.

1006
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:25,347
What have I been doing
for the last seven years?

1007
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:28,267
- Not that, evidently.
- Listen, Reva...

1008
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:32,980
...it's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...

1009
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:37,026
...but Tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.

1010
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:40,362
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it.

1011
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:44,283
Excuse me,
I'm getting some cigarettes.

1012
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:47,077
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.

1013
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,038
Excuse me?

1014
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:54,209
I said sit down before I raise my voice
and make a fool out of both of us.

1015
01:19:55,378 --> 01:19:56,670
Okay.

1016
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:03,719
Now it's my time to talk.

1017
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,681
Of course you took in
your son, my son...

1018
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,558
...our son...

1019
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:12,853
...and you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...

1020
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:15,814
...because most men ain't man enough
to do what you did.

1021
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:21,403
But that gives you no reason,
do you hear me, no reason...

1022
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:25,449
...to tell me that I can't be
a mother to my son.

1023
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:28,202
What you did...

1024
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:33,749
...is no different from what mothers
have done from the beginning of time.

1025
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:37,336
It's just too bad
more brothers won't do the same.

1026
01:20:37,587 --> 01:20:39,755
But don't think you're special.

1027
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:44,385
You may be cute, but not special.

1028
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:49,139
Drink your caf au lait. It's on me.

1029
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:57,940
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of Contempo's.

1030
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,734
Motherfuckers throwing cookies
out the cookie shop.

1031
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:02,736
Niggas was getting their bail on.

1032
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:06,073
I was smoking every motherfucker
that came in.

1033
01:21:06,282 --> 01:21:09,993
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?

1034
01:21:10,286 --> 01:21:11,286
What's up?

1035
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:15,624
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.

1036
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:26,969
Who's them niggas?

1037
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:29,138
Man, pick Chris up.

1038
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:31,640
Punk might start trippin'.

1039
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:36,603
That's those fools from Crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.

1040
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,449
Motherfucker ain't got
nothing better to do.

1041
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,910
Twenty-seven years old.
Still fucking motherfuckers our age...

1042
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:53,954
...with his old ass.

1043
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:55,289
What's up?

1044
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:56,874
Anyway...

1045
01:21:57,083 --> 01:22:01,295
...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib
at 2 in the motherfucking morning.

1046
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:03,964
Yo, man, that's my business.

1047
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:06,258
Yeah. Handle your shit, G.

1048
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:08,969
- Peer pressure, man.
- Handle your shit.

1049
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,180
Don't be like this motherfucker.

1050
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:15,434
This motherfucker got babies,
in-house pussy.

1051
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:17,770
Let me do shit like that,
Ma would be like:

1052
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:19,521
"I ain't having it."

1053
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:21,940
Ricky.

1054
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:24,026
Ricky!

1055
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:26,278
You know you heard me.

1056
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:28,030
What?

1057
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:30,282
I need you to go get some cornmeal.

1058
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:32,743
Yeah. I'll go in a little while.

1059
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:40,000
You wanna land a good job, you have
to know what most employers want.

1060
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:44,254
Like how to motivate yourself.
How to lead others.

1061
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,715
How to perform under pressure.

1062
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:51,637
Learn these things in the Army.
No matter what career you choose...

1063
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:55,683
...you'll really be ready to take off.

1064
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:00,020
Ricky, get up and go now.

1065
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:02,606
I can't finish frying the fish without it.

1066
01:23:02,857 --> 01:23:05,943
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.

1067
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:09,571
You ought to be happy
somebody's cooking for your ass.

1068
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,366
- Give me some, Dook.
- Here, take it.

1069
01:23:12,575 --> 01:23:14,076
- What's up?
- What's happening?

1070
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:16,954
D, go to the store for me
and get some cornmeal?

1071
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:21,250
Nigga, I ain't the one she told
to go get it. She's your wife.

1072
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:23,210
She ain't my wife, man.

1073
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:24,878
Shit.

1074
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,589
Might as well be,
y'all got a family and shit.

1075
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:30,509
"Tecmo Bowl" playing motherfucker.

1076
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:32,803
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.

1077
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:34,304
Sure, let's do it.

1078
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:35,597
What?

1079
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:39,601
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.

1080
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:42,021
You better get out
of my face, all right?

1081
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:44,481
What's up with Brandi?

1082
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:47,860
- Hey, you a punk, man!
- Hey, yo, yo. Wait a minute.

1083
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:49,069
Wait a minute!

1084
01:23:49,362 --> 01:23:51,488
This is family business.
Let them fight.

1085
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,742
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.

1086
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:57,286
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!

1087
01:23:57,537 --> 01:23:59,079
Get him, Dough.

1088
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:02,833
Let them fight, man.

1089
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:05,669
Brenda, Ricky and Doughboy
are out here fighting.

1090
01:24:05,837 --> 01:24:08,714
Hey, hey. Cut that out.
Get off of him.

1091
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:10,883
Get off of him!

1092
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:12,634
Damn.

1093
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:14,928
- What you hit me for?
- You all right?

1094
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,848
Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right!

1095
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:25,606
What you hit me for?

1096
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:28,108
It's the test scores. Ricky!

1097
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,986
Ricky, baby, your test scores!

1098
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:33,072
What you hit me for?

1099
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:35,783
Why you hitting me?

1100
01:24:36,826 --> 01:24:38,952
Yo, Dough. Why she hit you?

1101
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:40,829
Shut up, man.

1102
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:44,375
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking Army.

1103
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:47,461
- That's all there is to say.
- You're doing what?

1104
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,588
Man, what are you, a damn fool?

1105
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:52,299
They say I can learn
to work on computers.

1106
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,968
Plus, they'll give me
money for college.

1107
01:24:56,596 --> 01:24:59,264
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.

1108
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:02,518
They don't tell you that
you don't belong to you no more.

1109
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,813
You belong to them,
the government.

1110
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:08,148
Like a slave or something.

1111
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,609
My daddy told me a black man...

1112
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,987
...has got no business, no place
in the white man's Army.

1113
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,031
I heard all that.

1114
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:18,158
I got a little boy to think about, okay?

1115
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:22,287
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.

1116
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,790
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.

1117
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:29,211
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

1118
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:31,630
Listen, let me tell you something.

1119
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:34,633
When you join that Army,
you ain't gonna be nobody.

1120
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,473
Yo, you got any change?

1121
01:25:41,725 --> 01:25:43,767
No, I ain't got no change. See?

1122
01:25:44,477 --> 01:25:45,853
What up?

1123
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,194
Yo, chief. Here you go.

1124
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:58,115
Hey, no problem, bro.

1125
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,536
You win anything?

1126
01:26:03,955 --> 01:26:06,498
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.

1127
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,963
Shit. Nothing.

1128
01:26:14,215 --> 01:26:16,759
- What?
- I said nothing. I didn't win.

1129
01:26:16,968 --> 01:26:19,011
You gotta be Mexican
to win that shit.

1130
01:26:19,262 --> 01:26:23,349
Man, I win this lottery, I won't
have to worry about a damn thing.

1131
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:28,604
Don't have to worry about no colleges,
no 700 on no SATs. Not a damn...

1132
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:30,105
Look.

1133
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:36,820
There's that motherfucker
from the other night.

1134
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:42,076
Okay. When I say "cut,"
we'll cut through these houses.

1135
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:45,871
Cut!

1136
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:49,249
- Punk ass.
- Get him, man, get him!

1137
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:50,542
Let's get him.

1138
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:53,420
Go around the corner.
Cut them off. Come on, go!

1139
01:26:54,964 --> 01:26:56,131
Shit.

1140
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,050
Fucking mangy mutts!

1141
01:26:58,259 --> 01:26:59,301
Come on.

1142
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:01,136
I got you. I got you.

1143
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:03,889
- Come on, let's go.
- Hold on, man.

1144
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,559
- What are you doing?
- I gotta drain the weasel.

1145
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:15,943
If that motherfucker roll up on the set
one more time, I'll blast his ass.

1146
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:22,199
Shit! Rick!

1147
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:26,161
What a relief and shit.

1148
01:27:27,288 --> 01:27:29,790
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Let's split up.

1149
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,834
I don't think we should do that.

1150
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:34,962
I think it'd be better
if we're together.

1151
01:27:35,213 --> 01:27:39,466
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.

1152
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:44,513
- I'll meet you at your house.
- Cool. I'm out of here.

1153
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:49,601
Come on, man.

1154
01:28:26,097 --> 01:28:27,598
Ricky!

1155
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:06,887
Ricky.

1156
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:12,935
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

1157
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:15,229
Ricky!

1158
01:29:18,983 --> 01:29:20,109
Shit!

1159
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:36,917
Watch his head. Don't hurt him.

1160
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,462
Don't hurt him, man.

1161
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,676
Be careful with him.

1162
01:29:58,481 --> 01:30:00,065
Watch his head.

1163
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:01,942
He's dead.

1164
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:05,279
Let's take him home.

1165
01:30:33,933 --> 01:30:43,901
Mama!

1166
01:30:48,948 --> 01:30:50,324
No!

1167
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:58,165
Ricky! Oh, my God, no!
Not Ricky!

1168
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:02,836
What y'all doing now?

1169
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:05,339
Ricky?

1170
01:31:06,132 --> 01:31:07,424
Oh, my God.

1171
01:31:10,553 --> 01:31:13,055
Ricky? Ricky, baby, get up.

1172
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:16,642
Get up. Wake up, baby.

1173
01:31:16,893 --> 01:31:19,186
Ricky, get up. Get up.

1174
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:20,688
It's all right. Get up, baby.

1175
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:22,231
Get up. Tre, what happened?

1176
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:24,274
What happened to him?

1177
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:27,695
Give me the baby.
Give me the baby!

1178
01:31:27,946 --> 01:31:30,614
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!

1179
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:33,283
He don't need to be seeing this!

1180
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:35,994
Ricky, please wake up!

1181
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:38,706
Mom.

1182
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:42,418
- What did you do? What did you do?
- It wasn't my fault.

1183
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:45,254
- What did you do?
- Mama, I didn't do nothing.

1184
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:48,215
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.

1185
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:51,010
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

1186
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:53,429
What did you do?

1187
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:58,517
What did you do? You did this!
You did this! I'll kill you!

1188
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:03,897
You did it! I know you did it!
You did it! Yes, you did!

1189
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:12,906
I told you!

1190
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,164
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1191
01:32:20,373 --> 01:32:21,999
Oh, my God!

1192
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,835
Ricky, baby! Ricky!

1193
01:32:26,087 --> 01:32:28,964
Meet me at my house
in five minutes.

1194
01:32:39,392 --> 01:32:41,518
Tre, what happened?

1195
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,480
- Talk to me. What happened?
- Go home.

1196
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:46,690
- What happened to Ricky?
- Go home.

1197
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:49,818
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!

1198
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:53,113
I don't know. He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!

1199
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:57,993
Brandi, I want you to calm down and
I want you to go home. You hear me?

1200
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,454
- You hear me?
- Yes.

1201
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:06,710
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.

1202
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:10,547
Tre?

1203
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:15,886
Tre, what are you doing?

1204
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:27,147
Oh, you bad, now, huh?

1205
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:30,484
You bad. You gotta shoot
somebody now, huh?

1206
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:33,404
Well, here I am.

1207
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:35,823
Come on, shoot me.

1208
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:39,868
You bad, right?

1209
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:46,125
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

1210
01:33:46,918 --> 01:33:50,087
My heart goes out to his family,
but that's their problem.

1211
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:52,798
You my son. You my problem.

1212
01:33:54,759 --> 01:33:56,969
I want you to give me the gun.

1213
01:34:02,642 --> 01:34:06,020
I see. You want to end up
like little Chris in a wheelchair?

1214
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:10,858
Right? No, no, you want to end up
like Doughboy, huh? No?

1215
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:14,945
Give me the motherfucking gun, Tre!

1216
01:34:38,094 --> 01:34:42,014
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna
lose you to no bullshit, you hear?

1217
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:46,226
I love you, man.

1218
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:59,114
Go clean yourself up.

1219
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:02,451
Go on.

1220
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:40,322
Tre.

1221
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,282
Tre!

1222
01:35:48,498 --> 01:35:49,623
Damn.

1223
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:55,337
Shit!

1224
01:36:35,628 --> 01:36:36,754
Yeah.

1225
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:51,393
Let me out.

1226
01:37:00,987 --> 01:37:02,363
Dough...

1227
01:37:03,573 --> 01:37:05,074
...let me out.

1228
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:59,294
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.

1229
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:02,381
It's colder than a motherfucker
out here too.

1230
01:38:03,299 --> 01:38:04,633
Let's go eat.

1231
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,760
Cool.

1232
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:15,728
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.

1233
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,604
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.

1234
01:38:17,814 --> 01:38:20,190
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.

1235
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,277
What's up with the babe
you been talking to?

1236
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:25,154
- Fuck that bitch.
- You scared?

1237
01:38:25,405 --> 01:38:28,490
- He ain't scared, he just young.
- And dumb.

1238
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,909
I'm putting ketchup on this.

1239
01:38:31,161 --> 01:38:32,828
Why you put all that ketchup on it?

1240
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:36,373
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.

1241
01:38:41,129 --> 01:38:43,297
We going to see your girl?

1242
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:45,799
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.

1243
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:48,052
There they go, right there.

1244
01:38:48,553 --> 01:38:50,346
Turn off the lights.

1245
01:38:51,056 --> 01:38:52,848
Hit the lights, nigga.

1246
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:55,392
Take your ass home
and watch some videos.

1247
01:38:55,643 --> 01:38:57,311
Home with your mama.

1248
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:05,569
Check that motherfucker out.

1249
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:11,200
- Shit!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1250
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:13,702
Don't follow me. Go your own way.

1251
01:39:26,174 --> 01:39:28,759
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck you doing?

1252
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:31,553
This motherfucker's crazy!

1253
01:39:31,805 --> 01:39:35,224
Goddamn, man. And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!

1254
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:36,892
What the fuck you doing?

1255
01:39:37,727 --> 01:39:39,228
Shit!

1256
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:41,647
Yo, Dough. Let's bail, man.

1257
01:39:41,898 --> 01:39:43,816
- Let's go, man!
- Come on, nigga, now!

1258
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:47,319
Man, what the fuck?

1259
01:39:48,947 --> 01:39:50,739
Oh, shit!

1260
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:54,368
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

1261
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,875
Fuck you, man!

1262
01:40:02,127 --> 01:40:03,961
Fuck you!

1263
01:40:06,047 --> 01:40:08,048
Turn your punk ass over.

1264
01:40:14,222 --> 01:40:18,017
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.

1265
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:20,644
What the fuck you doing?

1266
01:40:20,937 --> 01:40:22,521
Come on, man.

1267
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:24,023
Well, fuck you!

1268
01:40:28,903 --> 01:40:30,654
Dough, let's bail, man.

1269
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:32,114
Man, let's move!

1270
01:40:32,323 --> 01:40:34,199
- Let's go!
- What the fuck you doing?

1271
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:36,744
- Let's bail, man!
- Let's go, man!

1272
01:40:36,995 --> 01:40:39,204
Come on, nigga, let's bail!

1273
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:43,167
Damn! Come on!

1274
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:46,712
Shit, let's get out of here.

1275
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:49,214
Here come the fucking police.

1276
01:40:50,216 --> 01:40:52,343
Get your ass in.

1277
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:55,095
Let's get the fuck up out of here.

1278
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:30,417
What's up?

1279
01:43:34,881 --> 01:43:36,674
Yo, coz.

1280
01:43:37,884 --> 01:43:41,095
I know why you got
out of the car last night.

1281
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:45,224
You shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

1282
01:43:45,892 --> 01:43:48,769
You don't want that shit
to come back to haunt you.

1283
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:57,319
I ain't been up this early
in a long time.

1284
01:44:01,866 --> 01:44:03,909
Turned on the TV this morning.

1285
01:44:06,454 --> 01:44:08,580
Had this shit on about...

1286
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:13,168
About living in a violent world.

1287
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:18,007
Showed all these foreign places.

1288
01:44:19,509 --> 01:44:21,677
How foreigners live and all.

1289
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:26,306
I started thinking, man.

1290
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:31,103
Either they don't know...

1291
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:34,231
...don't show...

1292
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:39,236
...or don't care about
what's going on in the 'hood.

1293
01:44:44,534 --> 01:44:46,869
They had all this foreign shit.

1294
01:44:47,829 --> 01:44:50,247
They didn't have shit
on my brother, man.

1295
01:44:59,758 --> 01:45:01,967
I ain't got no brother.

1296
01:45:14,689 --> 01:45:16,774
Got no mother, neither.

1297
01:45:20,403 --> 01:45:23,238
She loved that fool
more than she love me.

1298
01:45:23,698 --> 01:45:25,240
Doughboy.

1299
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:27,993
You got some blow? Got some rock?

1300
01:45:28,244 --> 01:45:30,329
Get the fuck out of my face!

1301
01:45:32,665 --> 01:45:35,751
Keep them goddamn babies
out the street.

1302
01:45:39,589 --> 01:45:41,382
Did y'all get them?

1303
01:45:53,144 --> 01:45:56,397
I don't even know
how I feel about it neither, man.

1304
01:45:58,483 --> 01:46:01,402
Shit just goes on and on, you know.

1305
01:46:03,697 --> 01:46:06,824
Next thing you know,
somebody might try to smoke me.

1306
01:46:11,454 --> 01:46:13,080
Don't matter, though.

1307
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:18,085
We all gotta go sometime, huh?

1308
01:46:21,881 --> 01:46:26,635
Seem like they punched
the wrong clock on Rick, though.

1309
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,432
Yeah.

1310
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:35,602
I gotta go, coz.

1311
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,232
Hey, Dough.

1312
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:43,819
What's up?

1313
01:46:50,702 --> 01:46:52,828
You still got one brother left, man.

1314
01:46:54,205 --> 01:46:56,040
Thanks, man.

1315
01:47:00,045 --> 01:47:01,211
- Later, G.
- Later.
