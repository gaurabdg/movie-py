1
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,734
He's clean.

2
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,486
So...

3
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,573
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,894
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,535
4:35.

6
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,287
You misunderstood.

7
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:10,834
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,420
There was a time?

9
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,089
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,967
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:22,220
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:24,847
She's 70.

13
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,933
If she's a day.

14
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:29,019
But there was a time.

15
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,189
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,776
- Listen, Mr. Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,363
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,326
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,037
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:52,375
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,460
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,172
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,966
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,761
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,305
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,891
No small matter.

27
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,771
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,024
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,778
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,906
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,911
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,670
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,177
<i>It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,391
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing,
so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:55,439
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobbler from Antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,734
<i>WOMA N: Oh, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:03,071
<i>The same could be said
for Doc's jelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:05,657
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,660
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:22,132
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,842
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,679
<i>- What do you want?
WOMA N: Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,973
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:34,352
<i>GLORIA: Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,
maybe then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,437
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:39,148
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,777
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,571
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>SMITH: Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,870
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,455
<i>ABE: Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:59,460
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,546
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,048
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:07,302
<i>SMITH:
And then there was this joker who had ears...</i>

56
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,387
<i>ABE: Let's get back.</i>

57
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,806
<i>SMITH: ... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,891
Max, who's your favorite uncle?

59
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,269
OK, who's your second favorite uncle?

60
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,146
Just pay attention.

61
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,148
I got something here.

62
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,985
<i>SMITH: And before you know it,
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

63
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,571
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:31,492
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in
your ear and tells you, you got a sure thing,</i>

65
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,496
<i>and what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,123
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

67
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,709
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,253
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:45,757
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,133
We're leaving.

71
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,887
<i>But mostly,
Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,972
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,475
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,977
- You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,771
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,148
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,900
Love you.

78
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:10,449
<i>TANNOY: They're off.</i>

79
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:16,329
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,789
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,917
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,711
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:28,216
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,635
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:34,431
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:37,392
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,643
Mm -hm.

88
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,395
You're good.

89
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,397
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,899
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,568
Why?

92
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:50,072
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:52,532
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,909
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,454
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,540
It's economically viable.

97
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,335
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,254
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:09,800
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,263
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,098
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,600
But until then...

103
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,061
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:25,023
Hey.

105
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,151
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:30,069
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,946
I love you, kid.

108
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,116
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,409
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,578
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,081
Start counting.

112
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,463
<i>TANNOY:
The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,308
<i>- Come on, come on.
TANNOY: The field is making towards</i>

114
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,979
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,482
<i>- Number Two has the lead...</i>

116
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,651
Come on.

117
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,153
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

118
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:16,241
<i>And Number Seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,408
Yes!

120
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,745
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

121
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,665
- Let's go!

122
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:28,419
<i>... to challenge, goes clear
and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,505
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,840
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,259
Yes!

126
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,512
Oh!

127
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,100
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,688
<i>Number One comes home
and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,108
<i>SMITH: Max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,318
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,071
20 large.

132
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,616
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,826
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,786
And lay it off.

135
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,955
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,499
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,711
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:13,381
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,384
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:20,263
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,640
The juice is ten.

142
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:27,145
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,731
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:34,403
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,239
Yeah.

146
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,162
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

147
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,331
<i>if you lose...</i>

148
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,876
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:55,590
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,689
Henry!

151
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,024
Henry!

152
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,530
Henry!

153
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,617
Henry!

154
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,954
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,039
No. Henry!

156
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,584
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,921
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,381
Urgh!

159
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,975
Where am I?

160
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,568
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,324
He already has.

162
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,748
Please.

163
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,959
I have a family.

164
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,504
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,423
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,592
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,346
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,477
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:35,774
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,444
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,044
Fuck.

172
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,629
Shit.

173
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,172
Jesus.

174
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:01,633
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,385
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,763
New outfit in town.

177
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:11,143
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:14,563
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,941
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:22,528
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,739
and came in third.

182
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,200
Now that's a story.

183
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,079
This...

184
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,164
This is something else.

185
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,333
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,834
No.

187
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,296
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:42,424
The catalyst.

189
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:46,803
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,847
<i>They look right...</i>

191
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,141
And you...

192
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:54,603
go left.

193
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,904
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,783
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:12,370
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,056
<i>- He's down!
- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,350
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm coming!

199
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,119
Coming.

200
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:22,084
It took you long enough.

201
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,252
You're not Nick.

202
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,754
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,341
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:34,512
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,100
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,602
So it's a good thing?

207
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,522
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,942
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,819
Who are you?

210
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,362
I'm Slevin.

211
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,949
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,701
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,786
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,080
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,832
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,752
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,048
<i>First... I lost my job.</i>

218
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,468
<i>Then I came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:17,221
<i>due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,808
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,978
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,700
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,161
Slevin.

224
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,581
It was an accident.

225
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,250
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:50,713
<i>MA N: Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:53,758
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,178
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York
and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,015
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first hand job
on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:04,060
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,814
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,
that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:11,026
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?
- Yeah.</i>

233
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:23,121
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,206
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,668
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,753
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,464
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,969
<i>Why don't you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,013
Am I being mugged?

240
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,640
Man!

241
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,018
And so here I am.

242
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,062
You said three.

243
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,481
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,402
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,404
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,406
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,366
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:03,286
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:06,623
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:08,917
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:12,045
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,130
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:17,050
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,135
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:20,803
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,764
Where's Nick?

257
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:26,017
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,102
<i>- How did you get in?
- Door was open.</i>

259
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,396
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,690
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,818
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,029
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,406
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:42,909
<i>- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a cup of sugar.</i>

265
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,203
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,955
- Touché.

267
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,958
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,877
Hello?

269
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,796
Hello?

270
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,466
They hung up.

271
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,970
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:04,473
No, except for that.

273
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,558
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,434
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,436
What are you doing?

276
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:12,397
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,816
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:18,236
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,655
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,740
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,286
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,663
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,748
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,250
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,335
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:38,298
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,217
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:43,261
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,723
<i>- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything didn't.</i>

290
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:50,268
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,353
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:56,691
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,861
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,196
OK.

295
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,535
I totally forgot...

296
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:10,163
Yeah.

297
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:11,623
Sorry.

298
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,626
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,129
<i>I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,049
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,635
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,929
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,974
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,393
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,645
What, my penis?

306
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,231
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:39,067
<i>Neighbors borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:41,445
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:42,904
Yeah.

310
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:45,949
<i>That's Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.</i>

311
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,617
No.

312
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:50,203
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,589
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,675
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,600
Whew!

316
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:20,859
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:24,612
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who...?

318
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,614
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:29,284
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:32,454
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,539
Go.

322
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,209
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,378
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,880
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,966
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,260
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:49,345
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,056
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,476
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,979
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,565
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,401
Who are you?

333
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,278
I'm Slevin.

334
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,824
You got some ID?

335
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,245
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,914
Look, look.

337
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,916
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,419
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,096
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,682
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:37,101
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,103
Motherfucker!

343
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,190
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,275
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,944
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,696
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,365
Now he told me that today.

348
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,951
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:56,705
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,164
Today.

351
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,832
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,709
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,464
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,883
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:11,302
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,888
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:16,933
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,810
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:23,731
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:24,732
No.

361
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,943
Orders.

362
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,320
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,157
<i>Orders is orders.</i>

364
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:37,996
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:46,755
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,549
My nose is already broken.

367
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,016
<i>- Can I just say one more thing?
- What?</i>

368
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,602
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:03,354
Uh... yeah.

370
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:08,026
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,559
SLEVIN: Ah, Jeez.

372
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,449
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:10,338
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,428
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,741
Well, listen.

376
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:42,037
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:45,290
<i>- I'm not Nick Fisher.
- Mr. Fisher?</i>

378
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,544
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

379
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,714
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,425
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,803
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,639
gave milk...

383
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:04,893
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,563
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:11,358
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:15,946
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:20,534
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,330
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:31,169
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,670
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,213
I'm The Boss.

392
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:36,508
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,343
Why?

394
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,762
Do we look alike?

395
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,683
So, Mr. Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,769
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,229
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,815
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,525
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,779
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,365
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,450
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,661
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:07,997
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:10,584
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,628
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:16,756
<i>No, do you want to give me $96,000?</i>

408
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:18,299
No, should I?

409
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,802
I don't know, should you?

410
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:25,182
I don't know, should I?

411
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:32,147
Long story short.

412
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:37,277
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:44,909
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,913
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:52,000
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,252
You owe me.

417
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:01,760
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

418
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,810
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,021
Slim?

420
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:16,483
No use.

421
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,862
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,615
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,367
Why?

424
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:31,414
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:32,957
Oh, OK.

426
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,920
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:41,299
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:43,801
Hm.

429
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:48,890
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

430
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,438
Well, that depends on the favor.

431
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,568
<i>THE BOSS: That was my son.</i>

432
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,779
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,198
Yeah.

434
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:07,784
That's because he's dead.

435
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,912
Murdered.

436
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,750
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:20,714
<i>Sent from an is to a was
before he'd had his breakfast.</i>

438
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,633
Bummer.

439
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,891
Lex Talionis.

440
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:34,770
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:52,120
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,374
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,585
Whose son?

444
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,378
The Rabbi's.

445
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,463
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,299
Because...

447
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:08,386
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,555
Who's his son?

449
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,308
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,894
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:19,314
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,319
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,906
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:29,991
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:32,577
Come on.

456
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,082
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,418
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,754
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,173
So where do I fit in?

460
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:47,342
You?

461
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:50,929
You're the trigger man.

462
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:53,431
Me?

463
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,809
You.

464
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,862
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,280
Of course there are.

466
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,699
Yes.

467
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,451
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:17,705
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:23,962
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,630
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,466
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,553
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,223
Slim could use the company.

474
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:37,225
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:39,895
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,565
Is there anything else?

477
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:47,569
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichéd as,

478
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,821
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,323
I think you just did.

480
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,326
I guess I did.

481
00:34:57,746 --> 00:35:01,083
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:08,673
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,843
Don't worry.

484
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,930
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,770
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:24,856
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,312
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:06,272
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,442
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:12,320
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:13,780
Where are we going?

492
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,824
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,993
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:21,079
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,667
<i>She can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:27,418
What is it?

497
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,504
<i>- I know this guy.
- Who?</i>

498
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:31,465
This guy.

499
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,634
You know that guy?

500
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:36,719
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,597
He was dead.

502
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,767
You met a dead guy?

503
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,852
Yeah.

504
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:47,439
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,903
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:55,613
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:59,784
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:05,082
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,171
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:14,674
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?

511
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:17,969
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,225
Hm.

513
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:37,697
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:41,993
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,707
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:52,003
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:53,588
Let's go.

518
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,841
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,803
Aaahh... better...

520
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,056
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:38:03,057 --> 00:38:05,100
You think?

522
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:13,900
What is it?

523
00:38:15,486 --> 00:38:16,945
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,531
<i>- Do you always speak for him?
- Yes.</i>

525
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,951
Hm.

526
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:25,161
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:26,204
Not quite.

528
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:28,373
Well, what, then?

529
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:31,000
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:33,587
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,176
- Hey, are we going to the...?
- No.

532
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:43,096
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:46,140
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:50,979
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:56,317
<i>And now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:59,237
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,582
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,504
Penthouse.

539
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:25,013
Gentle piano music

540
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,451
You must be Mr. Fisher.

541
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:51,706
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

542
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:54,918
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

543
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:58,672
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

544
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:03,676
For starters, I'm unlucky.

545
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:07,764
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

546
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:10,808
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

547
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,437
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

548
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:18,191
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

549
00:40:18,192 --> 00:40:23,989
but it took today for you to realize it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

550
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,576
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

551
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:31,746
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

552
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:34,249
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

553
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,334
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

554
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:37,502
I mean, what is that?

555
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:40,713
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

556
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:44,175
<i>I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi</i>

557
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,845
and a gangster?

558
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:52,100
I don't.

559
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,311
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

560
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:57,522
when I am what could've been or not have been.

561
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:01,777
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

562
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,446
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

563
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:06,698
...there are two men sitting here before you,

564
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:10,202
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

565
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,955
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

566
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:16,666
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

567
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,627
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

568
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:24,382
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

569
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:37,437
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

570
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:40,982
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

571
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:44,027
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

572
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:46,487
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

573
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:50,242
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

574
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:55,246
You have 48 hours to get my money.

575
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:59,126
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

576
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:06,842
Wait, I just have one question.

577
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,470
I wasn't frisked.

578
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:19,687
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

579
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:24,150
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

580
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:30,699
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

581
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,451
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

582
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:36,037
- Kosher.

583
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,208
Acceptable.

584
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,105
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

585
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:05,441
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

586
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:08,028
Now I can expect that when?

587
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:14,409
- Very soon.
- Good.

588
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,621
So, tell me. The kid...

589
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,540
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

590
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,920
The kid and I have unfinished business.

591
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,348
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

592
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,018
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

593
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:44,856
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

594
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:46,608
your own, someone else's.

595
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:50,278
That being said, he wasn't lying.

596
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:52,864
That's not Nick Fisher.

597
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:55,158
I know.

598
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:10,006
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

599
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:13,009
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

600
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,971
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

601
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:20,934
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

602
00:44:20,935 --> 00:44:23,228
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

603
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:26,356
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

604
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:30,401
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith. In the flesh.

605
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:35,406
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

606
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,993
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

607
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:41,037
<i>But I have no idea who he is
but I think you might,</i>

608
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:44,499
<i>so I take a picture using my cell phone
which I thought was a total waste</i>

609
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,085
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

610
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:52,841
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

611
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:55,426
This is Smith. Recognize him?

612
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,678
No.

613
00:44:57,096 --> 00:45:01,891
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

614
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:05,853
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

615
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:08,273
So I followed him.

616
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:16,739
<i>He went down
into an apartment building downtown.</i>

617
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,326
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

618
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,371
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

619
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:25,665
- Smith?
- You.

620
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:31,088
Me?

621
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:37,219
<i>You out of the same building
with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

622
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:40,138
Friends of yours?

623
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:42,140
Not exactly.

624
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:44,976
I think it's time you told me that story.

625
00:45:45,895 --> 00:45:49,564
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

626
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,651
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

627
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:57,364
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

628
00:46:04,663 --> 00:46:07,832
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

629
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,752
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

630
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:17,092
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

631
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:20,178
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

632
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:24,057
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

633
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:25,600
Ironic.

634
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:27,936
I know, I don't even gamble.

635
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:31,690
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

636
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,028
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

637
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:40,949
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

638
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,453
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

639
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,747
I'd say you're fucked.

640
00:46:47,748 --> 00:46:50,208
Fucked.

641
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,672
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

642
00:46:55,673 --> 00:46:58,049
I have Ataraxia.

643
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,718
Ataraxia?

644
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:06,058
It's a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

645
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:10,395
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

646
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:12,981
Oh, what are you gonna say?

647
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:16,651
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

648
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:19,654
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

649
00:47:21,824 --> 00:47:23,283
Yes.

650
00:47:23,742 --> 00:47:26,328
I knew you had sense.

651
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:30,415
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

652
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,250
Sometimes.

653
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,253
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

654
00:47:36,255 --> 00:47:40,384
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

655
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:43,344
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

656
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:46,223
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

657
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:50,435
He doesn't see it.

658
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,104
Wouldn't matter if he did.

659
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:55,190
Elvis lets me win.

660
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:58,527
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

661
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:02,280
Wait a minute. You know this game?

662
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:11,373
THE BOSS: You got three days.

663
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,500
I was thinking it would take me a week.

664
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,128
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

665
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:21,883
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

666
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,054
You win this game, you got your week.

667
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,268
Hm.

668
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,740
THE BOSS: So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

669
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:47,575
Was gonna play it by ear.

670
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:51,288
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

671
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:54,833
And, by the way, he has shadows.

672
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,589
Shadows?

673
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:06,428
Bodyguards.

674
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:09,222
With him all the time.

675
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,976
Military.

676
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:20,067
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

677
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:25,196
THE BOSS: They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-Israeli Mossad.

678
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:27,699
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

679
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:31,536
That doesn't sound good.

680
00:49:32,288 --> 00:49:34,956
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

681
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:37,792
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

682
00:49:37,793 --> 00:49:40,378
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

683
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:44,299
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

684
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,218
What's this?

685
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:48,553
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

686
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:53,308
- Get down!

687
00:49:54,476 --> 00:49:57,312
<i>Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.</i>

688
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,898
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

689
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:02,108
Where?

690
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:05,404
- Where?
- The apartment.

691
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,534
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

692
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:13,662
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

693
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:22,837
Then what?

694
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:25,674
He does the kid, I do him.

695
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:28,676
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

696
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:33,348
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

697
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,102
Take the clothes off- make it look like a,

698
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:43,275
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

699
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:46,528
And that's all there is to it.

700
00:50:47,154 --> 00:50:49,364
Is that all there is to it?

701
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:52,367
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

702
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,252
Peww!

703
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:07,382
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

704
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:11,303
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

705
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:16,141
Some have grown pretty dead.

706
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:22,147
You're a conundrum, you.

707
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:29,154
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

708
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:31,865
You can only kill me once.

709
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:40,624
Checkmate.

710
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:49,174
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

711
00:51:52,094 --> 00:51:54,388
Cat.

712
00:51:55,014 --> 00:51:57,307
Mouse.

713
00:51:58,475 --> 00:52:01,061
You've got three days.

714
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,109
Excuse me.

715
00:52:27,379 --> 00:52:29,548
Who the fuck is this guy?

716
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:33,635
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

717
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:38,514
because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

718
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:42,685
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

719
00:52:42,686 --> 00:52:44,896
Yes, boss.

720
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:48,316
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

721
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:51,444
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

722
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:55,407
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

723
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:06,668
- What have you got?
- Get this.

724
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:09,254
The Kat's in town.

725
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:10,505
Good Kat?

726
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:13,258
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

727
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:16,594
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

728
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:18,972
Um... who's er... who's Good Kat?

729
00:53:18,973 --> 00:53:21,683
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

730
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:24,811
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

731
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:27,438
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

732
00:53:27,439 --> 00:53:30,441
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

733
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:32,610
<i>Just what we need.</i>

734
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:34,279
All right.

735
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:40,202
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

736
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:50,879
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

737
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,590
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

738
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,466
Well, listen.

739
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,468
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

740
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,263
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

741
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:02,640
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

742
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,810
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

743
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:09,940
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

744
00:54:10,149 --> 00:54:12,567
My guess was a fastball.

745
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:17,238
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humor.

746
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:19,157
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

747
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:22,493
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

748
00:54:22,494 --> 00:54:25,496
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

749
00:54:25,497 --> 00:54:27,874
Between you and me...

750
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:32,587
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

751
00:54:33,422 --> 00:54:36,257
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

752
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:38,218
These two were poisoned.

753
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:40,845
Something exotic.

754
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:43,223
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

755
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,600
<i>Will do.</i>

756
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:47,185
Prick.

757
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:53,942
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

758
00:54:58,113 --> 00:55:00,615
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

759
00:55:01,992 --> 00:55:05,536
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

760
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:07,538
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

761
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,124
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

762
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:13,878
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and license

763
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:15,880
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

764
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:17,715
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

765
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:21,386
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

766
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:25,223
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

767
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:28,059
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

768
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,519
Hm.

769
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,021
- You should run.
- I can't.

770
00:55:32,022 --> 00:55:34,941
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

771
00:55:34,942 --> 00:55:37,986
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

772
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:40,154
This isn't the first time this has happened.

773
00:55:40,155 --> 00:55:43,700
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

774
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:47,579
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

775
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,664
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

776
00:55:49,665 --> 00:55:54,544
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

777
00:55:54,545 --> 00:55:56,921
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

778
00:55:56,922 --> 00:56:01,426
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

779
00:56:01,635 --> 00:56:05,263
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:10,101
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

781
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:14,231
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

782
00:56:17,693 --> 00:56:19,277
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

783
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:21,446
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:23,031
- Yeah.

785
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:26,618
OK. Um... No. Bye.

786
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,834
Hm...

787
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,545
Weird.

788
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:47,805
What?

789
00:56:47,806 --> 00:56:52,101
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

790
00:56:52,102 --> 00:56:56,648
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

791
00:56:56,982 --> 00:57:00,527
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

792
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,739
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

793
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,076
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

794
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:13,874
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

795
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:18,670
So, come here often?

796
00:57:20,673 --> 00:57:24,593
No. But I heard about someone who does.

797
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:28,513
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

798
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:31,099
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:32,642
Where?

800
00:57:38,816 --> 00:57:40,984
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

801
00:57:42,027 --> 00:57:43,945
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

802
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:45,905
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

803
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:46,739
Talking.

804
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,910
You're gonna go over and say, "I'm Slevin,
some bad dudes think I am someone I am not.

805
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:53,955
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

806
00:57:53,956 --> 00:57:56,207
and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

807
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,543
- I can't do that.
- You think?

808
00:57:58,544 --> 00:58:01,212
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

809
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:04,132
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

810
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:08,512
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

811
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,139
Beards. Right behind him.

812
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,142
<i>See 'em?</i>

813
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:18,646
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

814
00:58:18,647 --> 00:58:20,523
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

815
00:58:20,524 --> 00:58:23,402
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

816
00:58:23,736 --> 00:58:26,321
What do you think?

817
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,491
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

818
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:33,245
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

819
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,915
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

820
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,458
<i>Bodyguards nearby.</i>

821
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:42,503
<i>Our boy's not far away
but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

822
00:58:42,504 --> 00:58:46,382
<i>- Did Murph get a beat on him yet?
- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

823
00:58:46,383 --> 00:58:50,512
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even
bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

824
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:57,728
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

825
00:59:00,981 --> 00:59:03,859
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

826
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:27,549
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- Relax.</i>

827
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,802
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

828
00:59:34,348 --> 00:59:36,933
I got it next.

829
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:41,563
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

830
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:42,397
And?

831
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:44,566
I told him I thought we should get together.

832
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:46,025
- You didn't?
- I did.

833
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:48,111
And?

834
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:51,155
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

835
00:59:51,156 --> 00:59:55,702
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

836
00:59:56,328 --> 00:59:58,746
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

837
00:59:58,747 --> 01:00:01,040
- A what?
- The cops.

838
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,878
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

839
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:09,174
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

840
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:20,519
You and me need to talk.

841
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:26,775
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

842
01:00:33,866 --> 01:00:36,075
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

843
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:37,869
I'm not gay.

844
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:42,541
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

845
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:44,959
I've been watching you.

846
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,839
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

847
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,634
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

848
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:55,470
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

849
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:58,598
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

850
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:00,683
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

851
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:02,769
And you... are not him.

852
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:06,606
So... who the fuck are you?

853
01:01:10,277 --> 01:01:13,280
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

854
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:15,990
May I leave now?

855
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:17,909
- Come here.
- What?

856
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:23,498
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

857
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:30,088
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

858
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:32,090
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

859
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:33,425
Kananga?

860
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:36,970
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

861
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:39,556
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

862
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:44,019
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

863
01:01:44,478 --> 01:01:48,106
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

864
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:49,774
Who?

865
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,610
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

866
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:56,155
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

867
01:01:56,156 --> 01:02:01,036
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

868
01:02:18,262 --> 01:02:20,722
So...

869
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:25,560
See you later.

870
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:55,465
SLEVIN: Ah, that was incredible!
- You...

871
01:02:58,302 --> 01:03:01,512
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

872
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:04,682
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realizing that now?

873
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:09,354
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

874
01:03:09,355 --> 01:03:13,733
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

875
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:18,029
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

876
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,155
I naturally assumed...

877
01:03:19,156 --> 01:03:22,868
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

878
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:32,627
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

879
01:03:32,628 --> 01:03:38,133
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

880
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:41,344
Well, on that we agree.

881
01:03:43,222 --> 01:03:44,597
Same time on three.

882
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:46,391
- One...
- Two...

883
01:03:46,392 --> 01:03:48,351
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

884
01:03:48,352 --> 01:03:50,728
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

885
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:52,397
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

886
01:03:52,398 --> 01:03:54,482
The only James Bond is...

887
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:57,194
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

888
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:02,741
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

889
01:04:35,357 --> 01:04:37,943
Why are you going?

890
01:04:38,193 --> 01:04:40,695
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

891
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:43,615
OK.

892
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:49,037
Hurry back to me.

893
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:50,788
WENDY RENE: After Laughter

894
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:58,630
When you're in love, you're happy

895
01:04:58,714 --> 01:05:03,009
Oh, and when you're in her arms

896
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:08,724
You gain

897
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:12,810
After...

898
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:14,896
Hey! Police.

899
01:05:14,897 --> 01:05:17,065
Aw, come on, man.

900
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:20,068
I already talked to your buddy.

901
01:05:20,402 --> 01:05:24,906
After...
After your laughter

902
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:30,828
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

903
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:33,164
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

904
01:05:33,165 --> 01:05:36,376
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

905
01:05:36,377 --> 01:05:40,129
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

906
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,798
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

907
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:44,592
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

908
01:05:44,593 --> 01:05:46,470
Oh.

909
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:53,476
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

910
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:55,770
- What about me?
- Who are you?

911
01:05:55,771 --> 01:05:57,438
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

912
01:05:57,439 --> 01:06:00,024
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

913
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:02,611
You think I'm tall enough?

914
01:06:12,663 --> 01:06:16,416
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

915
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:18,793
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

916
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:21,713
<i>- Kelevra.
- Look, kid,</i>

917
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:24,966
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

918
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:27,552
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

919
01:06:27,553 --> 01:06:30,055
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

920
01:06:30,389 --> 01:06:33,183
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favors.

921
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:36,520
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

922
01:06:42,902 --> 01:06:45,487
Take a walk.

923
01:06:46,155 --> 01:06:49,574
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

924
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,875
When you're in love

925
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:45,464
You're happy

926
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:49,717
Oh, and when you're in her arms

927
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:55,223
You gain

928
01:07:56,934 --> 01:08:02,146
After
This doesn't matter...

929
01:08:02,147 --> 01:08:04,107
I have to go to work.

930
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,235
Hey.

931
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:09,821
After
After...

932
01:08:33,637 --> 01:08:37,265
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

933
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:40,310
I've got at least... Jesus.

934
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:44,147
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

935
01:10:02,184 --> 01:10:04,519
You're early.

936
01:10:07,064 --> 01:10:11,526
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

937
01:10:22,913 --> 01:10:24,789
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

938
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,042
I wasn't expecting you for...

939
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:31,963
<i>You look good.</i>

940
01:10:32,298 --> 01:10:34,799
<i>- You want some wine?
- No.</i>

941
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,386
Is something the matter?

942
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,808
Somebody's trying to kill you.

943
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:46,645
Who?

944
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:50,732
Me.

945
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:47,039
- That was close.
- Yeah.

946
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:06,910
Close.

947
01:14:29,952 --> 01:14:32,537
<i>THE BOSS: I hired you to do a job.</i>

948
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:36,166
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

949
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:43,465
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

950
01:14:44,758 --> 01:14:48,303
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

951
01:14:48,304 --> 01:14:50,680
beginning to look very much

952
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:53,266
like a job.

953
01:15:01,734 --> 01:15:04,236
All right. Fuck it.

954
01:15:06,322 --> 01:15:08,907
If the Rabbi wants a war...

955
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:12,452
...l'll give him a war.

956
01:15:19,251 --> 01:15:21,503
Saul.

957
01:15:23,756 --> 01:15:26,758
- Saul.

958
01:15:26,759 --> 01:15:29,052
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

959
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:31,221
Oh.

960
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:33,724
I thought you were Saul.

961
01:15:35,935 --> 01:15:38,854
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

962
01:15:41,857 --> 01:15:44,484
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

963
01:15:44,485 --> 01:15:47,487
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

964
01:15:47,821 --> 01:15:51,866
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

965
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:55,119
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

966
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,040
But names, even made-up ones...

967
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,919
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

968
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,964
Now...

969
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:08,258
the woman in the picture with Grant,

970
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:10,843
<i>- her name was er...
- Eva Marie Saint.</i>

971
01:16:10,844 --> 01:16:13,805
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

972
01:16:13,806 --> 01:16:17,100
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

973
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:20,144
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

974
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:23,147
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

975
01:16:23,148 --> 01:16:27,235
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

976
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:32,407
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

977
01:16:36,328 --> 01:16:38,288
Is that my money?

978
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:40,248
This is everything I owe you.

979
01:17:14,366 --> 01:17:18,453
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

980
01:17:18,454 --> 01:17:20,413
I know.

981
01:17:20,414 --> 01:17:22,373
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

982
01:17:22,374 --> 01:17:23,625
Saul!

983
01:17:23,626 --> 01:17:26,878
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

984
01:17:30,299 --> 01:17:33,135
Saul's dead.

985
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:37,180
<i>They're all dead.</i>

986
01:18:01,163 --> 01:18:03,749
Oh, I've been in this room before.

987
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:08,336
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

988
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:11,715
Somehow...

989
01:18:12,007 --> 01:18:13,591
Somehow it seems different.

990
01:18:13,592 --> 01:18:17,846
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

991
01:18:18,597 --> 01:18:22,350
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

992
01:18:23,102 --> 01:18:26,312
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

993
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:31,192
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

994
01:18:31,193 --> 01:18:33,779
20 years...

995
01:18:35,281 --> 01:18:39,201
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

996
01:18:41,203 --> 01:18:44,539
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

997
01:18:47,793 --> 01:18:52,672
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won,
if such a term may be applied.</i>

998
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,469
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

999
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,225
Should we get on with it, then?

1000
01:19:09,273 --> 01:19:11,733
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1001
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:20,325
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1002
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:24,996
Nice speech, though.

1003
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:31,169
I wish I was standing for it.

1004
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,516
You... you brought this upon our heads.

1005
01:19:46,393 --> 01:19:50,939
- Me?
- You... you hired Good Kat to kill my son.

1006
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:55,026
After you murdered my son?

1007
01:19:56,278 --> 01:19:59,197
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1008
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:01,783
Just like in '84?

1009
01:20:01,825 --> 01:20:05,954
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1010
01:20:08,207 --> 01:20:10,792
Time's up, Rabbi.

1011
01:20:11,835 --> 01:20:15,338
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1012
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:21,386
You were getting too big.

1013
01:20:22,805 --> 01:20:25,265
See...

1014
01:20:26,141 --> 01:20:28,309
...problem when two men are standing in a room

1015
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:31,312
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1016
01:20:31,313 --> 01:20:35,275
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1017
01:20:37,486 --> 01:20:39,321
Then they called you The Boss.

1018
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:44,534
It was clear what had to be done.

1019
01:20:50,499 --> 01:20:53,835
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1020
01:20:55,838 --> 01:21:00,300
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1021
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:03,512
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1022
01:21:07,433 --> 01:21:09,893
The dead eyes of...

1023
01:21:12,855 --> 01:21:16,024
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1024
01:21:19,278 --> 01:21:21,362
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1025
01:21:21,363 --> 01:21:25,033
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1026
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:28,453
...looking for your son.

1027
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,752
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1028
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:39,506
And now...

1029
01:21:40,132 --> 01:21:42,718
...after all these years...

1030
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,304
...in spite of our agreement!

1031
01:21:47,056 --> 01:21:48,681
You... you...

1032
01:21:48,682 --> 01:21:52,227
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1033
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:55,355
You managed to take my son away from me.

1034
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,900
Well...

1035
01:21:59,652 --> 01:22:01,819
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1036
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:05,365
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1037
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,125
You haven't heard.

1038
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:18,587
Will I?

1039
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:22,883
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1040
01:22:24,343 --> 01:22:26,511
Your son is dead.

1041
01:22:29,473 --> 01:22:32,059
Your son is dead.

1042
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:37,355
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1043
01:22:39,275 --> 01:22:40,817
<i>SLEVIN: Rabbi.</i>

1044
01:22:41,694 --> 01:22:44,279
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1045
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,627
Fisher.

1046
01:23:00,045 --> 01:23:02,506
Fisher, listen to me.

1047
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:07,552
I already told you,

1048
01:23:07,553 --> 01:23:10,138
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1049
01:23:14,935 --> 01:23:17,521
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1050
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:25,987
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1051
01:23:27,156 --> 01:23:29,115
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1052
01:23:29,116 --> 01:23:32,327
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1053
01:23:39,752 --> 01:23:42,337
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1054
01:23:49,845 --> 01:23:52,848
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1055
01:23:53,224 --> 01:23:55,516
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1056
01:23:55,517 --> 01:23:58,103
<i>In books.</i>

1057
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:04,025
<i>And who has books?</i>

1058
01:24:11,659 --> 01:24:14,119
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1059
01:24:15,538 --> 01:24:16,746
He's clean.

1060
01:24:16,747 --> 01:24:19,249
<i>SLEVIN: Crooked bookies...</i>

1061
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:23,211
<i>- ... who work with big-time crooks.
- So... why are you here?</i>

1062
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,641
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1063
01:24:37,726 --> 01:24:39,978
<i>One who was in both books...</i>

1064
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:42,730
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1065
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:43,982
Got him.

1066
01:24:43,983 --> 01:24:46,568
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1067
01:24:46,694 --> 01:24:49,279
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1068
01:24:50,447 --> 01:24:51,906
1729.

1069
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:54,284
Nick Fisher.

1070
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:56,787
OK.

1071
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,550
<i>GOODKAT: There was a time.</i>

1072
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:29,945
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1073
01:25:50,007 --> 01:25:53,843
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man</i>

1074
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:56,638
<i>who does the jobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1075
01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:00,809
<i>THE BOSS: I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1076
01:26:01,769 --> 01:26:04,563
There's a specialist.

1077
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:08,817
Calls himself Mr. Good Kat.

1078
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:16,867
Fine.

1079
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,829
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1080
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,210
Are you ready?

1081
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:29,671
Yeah.

1082
01:26:32,299 --> 01:26:34,801
It's just that one last thing.

1083
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:45,228
<i>THE BOSS: Mr. Good Kat.</i>

1084
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:47,939
It's been a long time.

1085
01:26:51,819 --> 01:26:56,907
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Good Kat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1086
01:26:57,533 --> 01:27:01,912
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1087
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:05,874
And I guess you've already heard about...

1088
01:27:06,959 --> 01:27:10,045
<i>- ... my son.
- Yes, I heard.</i>

1089
01:27:10,588 --> 01:27:12,463
I need you to sort it out for me.

1090
01:27:12,464 --> 01:27:14,215
Who's the mark?

1091
01:27:14,216 --> 01:27:16,301
Yitzchok.

1092
01:27:19,221 --> 01:27:20,889
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1093
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:23,224
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1094
01:27:23,225 --> 01:27:25,184
I remember The Rabbi well.

1095
01:27:25,185 --> 01:27:26,853
<i>Thing is...</i>

1096
01:27:26,854 --> 01:27:29,856
it can't look like a job.

1097
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:33,276
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1098
01:27:35,404 --> 01:27:40,409
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1099
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,661
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1100
01:27:43,662 --> 01:27:46,248
Anything can be done.

1101
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:50,418
Good. How?

1102
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:53,088
Kansas City Shuffle.

1103
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:56,842
I'm not familiar with the term.

1104
01:27:59,094 --> 01:28:01,387
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1105
01:28:01,388 --> 01:28:07,519
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1106
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:14,401
What are you looking for?

1107
01:28:17,446 --> 01:28:20,532
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1108
01:28:20,741 --> 01:28:22,951
1729.

1109
01:28:22,952 --> 01:28:24,410
Nick Fisher.

1110
01:28:24,411 --> 01:28:26,038
Why him?

1111
01:28:26,705 --> 01:28:28,498
A loser.

1112
01:28:28,499 --> 01:28:31,293
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1113
01:28:39,301 --> 01:28:41,719
<i>GOODKAT: Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1114
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,888
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1115
01:28:43,889 --> 01:28:46,099
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1116
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,352
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1117
01:28:49,353 --> 01:28:52,564
Like I said... very big job.

1118
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:56,818
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1119
01:28:56,819 --> 01:29:00,155
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1120
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:04,534
No. But something like that.

1121
01:29:08,205 --> 01:29:11,249
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1122
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,876
And I hate baseball.

1123
01:29:12,877 --> 01:29:16,254
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1124
01:29:16,255 --> 01:29:19,633
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1125
01:29:20,009 --> 01:29:23,845
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1126
01:29:23,846 --> 01:29:28,766
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1127
01:29:28,767 --> 01:29:32,479
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1128
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:36,274
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1129
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:38,359
than he does to The Boss dead.

1130
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,612
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1131
01:29:40,613 --> 01:29:45,283
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1132
01:29:45,659 --> 01:29:47,285
I'm listening.

1133
01:29:47,286 --> 01:29:51,456
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1134
01:29:51,457 --> 01:29:55,085
- Ohh.
- And that...

1135
01:29:56,462 --> 01:29:58,964
And that will make us friends.

1136
01:29:59,298 --> 01:30:01,800
Right, Rabbi?

1137
01:30:02,426 --> 01:30:04,302
Hm?

1138
01:30:07,973 --> 01:30:12,769
And... since friends do favors for their friends,
you will do a favor for me.

1139
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,772
Pray tell? What is this favor?

1140
01:30:15,773 --> 01:30:19,400
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1141
01:30:19,401 --> 01:30:20,652
Whose?

1142
01:30:20,653 --> 01:30:23,780
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1143
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:26,074
Who is he?

1144
01:30:26,075 --> 01:30:28,159
Just a loser.

1145
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,746
You just made a lot of money.

1146
01:30:33,707 --> 01:30:37,419
<i>SLEVIN: And then I was free
to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1147
01:30:50,891 --> 01:30:51,766
Hm?

1148
01:30:51,767 --> 01:30:55,353
Whatever they're paying you...

1149
01:31:01,777 --> 01:31:03,612
Oh.

1150
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:05,781
There is nobody.

1151
01:31:07,575 --> 01:31:10,202
I did this to you.

1152
01:31:12,705 --> 01:31:14,373
- Me.
- You.

1153
01:31:14,707 --> 01:31:16,958
Me.

1154
01:31:22,631 --> 01:31:25,092
Who are you?

1155
01:31:27,303 --> 01:31:29,387
<i>BRIKOWSKl: Who is he?</i>

1156
01:31:29,388 --> 01:31:33,766
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1157
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:35,727
What about dental records?

1158
01:31:35,728 --> 01:31:41,775
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1159
01:31:42,109 --> 01:31:44,694
What a fucking mess.

1160
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:48,072
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1161
01:31:48,073 --> 01:31:52,243
<i>We found two more bodies
to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1162
01:31:52,244 --> 01:31:54,329
All right, I'll be right over.

1163
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:58,666
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1164
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:02,128
<i>Negative.
We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1165
01:32:02,129 --> 01:32:03,796
Send somebody over.

1166
01:32:03,797 --> 01:32:05,424
<i>Copy.</i>

1167
01:32:06,926 --> 01:32:09,844
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1168
01:32:09,845 --> 01:32:11,846
No, I'm fine.

1169
01:32:11,847 --> 01:32:14,433
All right.

1170
01:32:37,373 --> 01:32:40,625
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1171
01:32:40,626 --> 01:32:42,293
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1172
01:32:42,294 --> 01:32:45,505
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry?</i>

1173
01:32:45,506 --> 01:32:49,467
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1174
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:51,553
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1175
01:32:51,554 --> 01:32:55,390
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1176
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:58,017
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- We're making small talk.</i>

1177
01:32:58,018 --> 01:33:01,771
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1178
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:05,316
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1179
01:33:05,317 --> 01:33:09,070
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1180
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:13,032
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1181
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:15,827
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1182
01:33:15,828 --> 01:33:19,790
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1183
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,895
I have that same phone.

1184
01:33:53,782 --> 01:33:58,286
<i>About an hour later the phone rings, it's Harry,
talking like a goddamned machine gun,</i>

1185
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:01,289
going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1186
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:06,211
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1187
01:34:06,712 --> 01:34:09,548
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1188
01:34:16,722 --> 01:34:18,932
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1189
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:22,977
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,
The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1190
01:34:22,978 --> 01:34:26,147
<i>before people started
waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1191
01:34:26,148 --> 01:34:30,902
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1192
01:34:30,903 --> 01:34:33,196
His name was Max.

1193
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:39,494
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1194
01:34:39,495 --> 01:34:41,871
Roth laid the bet off.

1195
01:34:41,872 --> 01:34:43,915
On you.

1196
01:34:52,925 --> 01:34:55,177
And you.

1197
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,519
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1198
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,604
they are the opposite of happy.

1199
01:35:06,605 --> 01:35:09,691
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1200
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:10,650
Aargh!

1201
01:35:10,651 --> 01:35:13,027
These guys kill everyone!

1202
01:35:13,028 --> 01:35:14,780
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1203
01:35:15,364 --> 01:35:18,783
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1204
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,785
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1205
01:35:20,786 --> 01:35:24,790
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1206
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:30,754
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take the job.</i>

1207
01:35:48,188 --> 01:35:50,982
What have you done with my son?

1208
01:36:06,832 --> 01:36:08,625
You?

1209
01:36:08,626 --> 01:36:10,835
No.

1210
01:36:10,836 --> 01:36:13,588
You're dead.

1211
01:36:14,673 --> 01:36:17,592
You're dead!

1212
01:36:23,349 --> 01:36:27,602
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1213
01:36:27,603 --> 01:36:31,856
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1214
01:36:31,857 --> 01:36:33,942
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1215
01:36:33,943 --> 01:36:36,277
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1216
01:36:36,278 --> 01:36:40,740
<i>He says the horse's name was
Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1217
01:36:40,741 --> 01:36:43,201
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1218
01:36:51,877 --> 01:36:54,463
Do you remember this part?

1219
01:37:04,723 --> 01:37:07,850
Please! I have a family.

1220
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:09,811
Not any more, you don't.

1221
01:37:09,812 --> 01:37:12,105
Henry!

1222
01:37:13,691 --> 01:37:16,276
You fucking bastards!

1223
01:37:17,444 --> 01:37:20,572
You fucking bastards!

1224
01:37:39,425 --> 01:37:42,552
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1225
01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:50,769
Fuck you both.

1226
01:38:14,793 --> 01:38:19,881
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra,
as far as I can tell.</i>

1227
01:38:19,882 --> 01:38:22,217
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1228
01:38:22,218 --> 01:38:25,303
<i>Which is interesting,
him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1229
01:38:25,304 --> 01:38:27,722
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1230
01:38:27,723 --> 01:38:31,059
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1231
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:33,895
<i>I thought to myself, maybe it means something.</i>

1232
01:38:33,896 --> 01:38:38,775
<i>Then again, maybe its just a coincidence,
name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1233
01:38:38,776 --> 01:38:43,030
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1234
01:38:47,535 --> 01:38:51,163
<i>Ah, one more thing,
we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1235
01:38:51,413 --> 01:38:54,499
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1236
01:38:55,459 --> 01:39:00,588
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1237
01:39:00,589 --> 01:39:02,840
<i>He says it means...</i>

1238
01:39:02,841 --> 01:39:05,343
Bad dog.

1239
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:14,102
<i>BRIKOWSKl:
20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1240
01:39:14,103 --> 01:39:16,813
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1241
01:39:32,454 --> 01:39:35,040
Brikowski? You there?

1242
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:31,323
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1243
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,160
She took my picture.

1244
01:41:35,619 --> 01:41:38,205
She's got to go in the ground.

1245
01:41:39,999 --> 01:41:41,541
OK.

1246
01:42:02,605 --> 01:42:05,107
I have something I have to tell you.

1247
01:42:07,318 --> 01:42:09,903
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1248
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:17,285
You're gonna have to trust me.

1249
01:42:28,297 --> 01:42:30,757
Shit!

1250
01:42:33,177 --> 01:42:35,762
He's going to shoot you here.

1251
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,280
I didn't think you'd understand.

1252
01:43:52,423 --> 01:43:54,591
I understood.

1253
01:43:58,888 --> 01:44:01,055
How did you find out about us?

1254
01:44:01,056 --> 01:44:03,391
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1255
01:44:03,392 --> 01:44:05,977
How do you think I found out?

1256
01:44:09,106 --> 01:44:11,483
I thought you might want this.

1257
01:44:50,814 --> 01:44:52,774
I want to go home.

1258
01:44:52,775 --> 01:44:55,610
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.

1259
01:44:58,948 --> 01:45:01,533
My name is Good Kat.

1260
01:45:02,076 --> 01:45:04,661
You can call me Mr. Good Kat.
