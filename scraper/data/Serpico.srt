1
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,738
This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.

2
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,740
We're bringing in a wounded cop.

3
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:17,660
All right, 10-4.

4
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,838
8th Precinct.

5
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,468
Jesus Christ.

6
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,230
Guess who got shot.

7
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,984
Serpico.

8
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,739
You think a cop did it?

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,949
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

10
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,926
Hello.

11
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,888
New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.

12
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,766
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,935
- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.

14
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,859
To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...

15
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,403
and to enforce it impartially...

16
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,572
respecting the equality
of all men...

17
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,742
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,580
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

19
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,999
and also your character.

20
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,628
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

21
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,797
compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,633
and perseverance...

23
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,801
and patience.

24
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:25,431
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

25
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,310
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

26
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,821
Same time, same place-
both reports.

27
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,783
I already made out a 424.

28
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,369
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

29
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,454
Who was with Serpico?

30
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,916
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

31
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,710
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

32
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,129
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,269
Another thing-
I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

34
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,604
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

35
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:14,707
Anthony Sardo.

36
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,254
Ralph Seidler.

37
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,886
Frank Serpico.

38
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,528
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

39
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,156
Get closer!

40
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,561
Patrolman Serpico.

41
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,273
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

42
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,666
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

43
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,169
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

44
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,338
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

45
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,322
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,949
Gather around. Let's go.

47
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
All right. Settle down.

48
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,666
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

49
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,420
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

50
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,672
squad two, red sector...

51
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,674
squad three, green sector.

52
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,054
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

53
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,889
I'll help the boys, Florence.

54
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,225
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

55
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,519
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

56
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,438
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

57
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,358
How about a roast beef on roll?

58
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,532
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

59
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,579
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,836
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

61
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,380
Sit down, sit down.

62
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,008
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,928
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,473
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

65
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,732
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

66
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,527
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

67
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,664
SectorD-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...

68
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:46,127
vicinity ofPS 218,
GrandA venue and BQ Expressway.

69
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,840
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

70
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,509
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

71
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,805
It's on the borderline.

72
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,558
I'm gonna take it.

73
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,311
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

74
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,511
Oh, my God!

75
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,684
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

76
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,229
Oh, shit!

77
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,523
- Come on. Give us-
- Don't shoot now.

78
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,066
Be cool.

79
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

80
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,071
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

81
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,907
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

82
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,076
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

83
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,373
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

84
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

85
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,212
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

86
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,381
Just be cool. All right.

87
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,217
All right. All right.
That's it.

88
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,578
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,875
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,087
He- He held me down.

91
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,884
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,928
they'd kill me.

93
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,853
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

94
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,022
Would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,954
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

96
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,002
Okay, hard-on.

97
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,297
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,138
Hey, Frank,
you want a piece of this?

99
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,808
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

100
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,041
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

101
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,043
- Sure.
- Thanks.

102
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,925
Thank you, Charlie.

103
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,312
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

104
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,023
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

105
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,192
That's not my kind of fun.

106
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,528
Shit.

107
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,200
I want to talk to you.

108
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,786
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

109
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,497
without cuffs.

110
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,711
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

111
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,839
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

112
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,341
Understand?

113
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,053
Come on.

114
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.

115
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,899
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

116
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,403
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

117
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,739
I got a feeling
you just went along.

118
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,285
But you're the one
who got caught.

119
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,663
You never even
got your cock out.

120
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,582
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

121
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,299
Look at you.

122
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,052
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

123
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,766
I don't understand you,
you know that?

124
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,935
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

125
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,980
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

126
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,107
You don't owe them nothin'.

127
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,612
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

128
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,656
What can I get?

129
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,494
Oh, let's see-
kidnapping...

130
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,705
sodomy, rape...

131
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,083
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,426
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

133
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,265
Let it go, Harv!

134
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,861
Take the shot.

135
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,113
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

136
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,490
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

137
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,745
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

138
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,706
- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!

139
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,708
- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!

140
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,279
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

141
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,698
Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,870
Spread!

143
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,916
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

144
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,918
Turn around slow.

145
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,476
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

146
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,399
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

147
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,319
We take the collar.

148
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,698
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

149
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,117
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

150
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,246
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

151
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,666
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

152
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:08,421
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

153
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,465
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

154
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,345
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

155
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,015
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

156
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,023
Come on, Frankie!

157
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,526
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

158
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,156
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

159
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,510
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

160
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,643
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

161
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,853
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

162
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,898
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

163
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,150
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

164
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,569
Rev it up. Rev it up!

165
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,533
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

166
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,535
Okay. Good job.

167
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,578
You people do good work here.

168
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,916
So, how you doing, Frankie?

169
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,253
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

170
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,298
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

171
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,467
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

172
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,179
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

173
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:44,183
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

174
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,937
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

175
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,773
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

176
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,068
What's going on
with you two anyway?

177
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,488
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,034
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

179
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,662
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

180
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,833
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

181
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,961
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

182
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,425
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

183
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,887
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

184
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,222
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

185
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,893
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

186
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,895
NYU? Greenwich Village?

187
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,147
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

188
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,399
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

189
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,276
Tell Pop I was here.

190
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,236
Frankie, Sunday?

191
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,822
Sunday what?

192
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,033
Dinner? Huh?

193
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,329
- Do me one favor- no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

194
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,498
All right.
A couple of announcements.

195
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,833
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

196
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,002
to be given at John Jay College.

197
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,171
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

198
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,340
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

199
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,593
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

200
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,055
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

201
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,974
Signed, Captain McGuire."

202
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,227
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

203
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,398
Hot enough for ya?

204
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,193
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

205
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,529
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

206
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,593
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

207
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,055
Check one print category, two-
That's plenty.

208
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,769
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

209
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:55,898
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

210
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,526
All my life.

211
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,821
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

212
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,324
Barto, it's not just that.

213
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,161
You don't like me.

214
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,788
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

215
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,250
Barto, stop buggin' me.

216
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,095
Mama?

217
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,905
Wanna buy a puppy?

218
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,125
Look at that, huh?

219
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,670
Where'd you get these dogs?

220
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,840
Oh, they're mine.

221
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,051
Want one for free?

222
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,640
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

223
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,311
You got it.

224
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,944
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

225
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,446
What?

226
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,742
Come on.

227
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,660
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

228
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,747
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

229
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,749
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

230
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,281
Don Quixote.

231
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,551
Señorita Land?

232
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,766
Mr. Serpico.

233
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,727
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

234
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,438
Well, I'm going to work
at the Café Reggio.

235
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,440
Café Reggio.

236
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:13,197
- That's 4th Street and-
- MacDougal and 3rd.

237
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,491
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

238
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,452
Jesus, what's that?

239
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,913
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

240
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,374
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

241
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,711
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

242
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,048
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

243
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,050
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

244
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,052
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

245
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,597
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

246
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,099
- What do you do?
- Me?

247
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:44,437
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

248
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,398
In that order?

249
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,819
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

250
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,011
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

251
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,679
Jetés.

252
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,978
You try it.

253
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,106
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

254
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,365
Next life. Come on.

255
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,870
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

256
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,543
My Life by Isadora Duncan.

257
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,088
She was a ballet dancer.

258
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,422
A belly dancer?

259
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,095
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

260
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,307
- You know ballet?
- A little.

261
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,103
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

262
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,064
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

263
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,692
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

264
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,694
That's where I go
after I leave here.

265
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,780
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

266
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,283
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

267
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,492
I noticed.

268
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,161
There's five positions.

269
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,371
Five pos-
You're being shortchanged.

270
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,291
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

271
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,918
Watch. See?

272
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,587
This is the first position.

273
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,922
From this position,
I can do anything.

274
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,799
- You want to see?
- Sure.

275
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,801
Here we go.

276
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,765
Bye, Barto!

277
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,394
- Lieutenant Steiger-
- No, no. Later.

278
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,945
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

279
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,115
Positions, positions!

280
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,243
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

281
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,371
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

282
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,583
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

283
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,628
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

284
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,713
Barto wants a specimen.

285
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,090
I'm gonna look into this matter.

286
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,473
- What do you got there?
- Here.

287
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,141
Straight ahead.

288
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,938
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

289
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,484
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

290
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,947
She just pulled down the shade.

291
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,076
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

292
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,248
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

293
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,126
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

294
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,462
Were you goin' down on him?

295
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:03,177
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

296
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,180
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

297
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,683
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

298
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,395
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

299
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,147
There!

300
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,111
You actually accusing me of this?

301
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,450
Good morning, Captain McCIain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

302
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,703
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

303
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,292
Certainly, son.
Come in.

304
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,548
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

305
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:44,218
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

306
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:47,597
But it- it could affect
your future in the BCI.

307
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,561
Sir, I tell you...

308
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,897
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

309
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,151
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

310
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,403
because I've been there
two years now...

311
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,405
And you want a transfer.

312
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,159
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

313
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,954
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

314
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,751
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

315
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,966
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

316
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,635
You are Catholic?

317
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,264
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

318
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,477
Alfie, come on.

319
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,689
I missed you, baby.

320
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,361
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

321
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,154
Why Paco?

322
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:48,241
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

323
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,661
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

324
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,581
Well, what'll I call you...

325
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,667
Frank or Paco?

326
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,644
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

327
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,230
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

328
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,566
But he works for
an advertising agency.

329
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,193
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

330
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,570
Paco's a policeman.

331
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,697
That's terrific.

332
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,323
I work for the police department.

333
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,534
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

334
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,828
See ya.

335
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,790
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

336
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,126
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

337
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,753
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

338
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,881
Really? How exciting!

339
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:48,384
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

340
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,095
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

341
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,182
We should get together then,
file or something.

342
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:57,268
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

343
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,772
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

344
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:05,151
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

345
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,278
Will you do me a big favor?

346
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,363
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

347
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:12,366
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

348
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,368
Okay.

349
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,670
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

350
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,466
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

351
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,636
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

352
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,972
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

353
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,849
What's a mind fucker?

354
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,976
Well, that's a chick...

355
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,355
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

356
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,524
Oh, yeah?

357
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,859
Well, she's very perceptive.

358
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,160
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

359
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,204
it's too rigidly stylized.

360
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,833
Well, yeah, you know-
Yeah, but...

361
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,379
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

362
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:11,259
you start to appreciate the
clarity- you know, the authority.

363
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,970
I got a sheep dog.

364
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,098
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

365
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,517
dating back...

366
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,310
for 16 generations...

367
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,314
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

368
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,068
The family crest...

369
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,488
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

370
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,990
Oh, shit!

371
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,958
Paco, everybody loves you!

372
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,377
I love you!

373
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,713
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

374
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,054
Give her this, will ya?

375
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,601
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

376
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:04,979
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

377
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,939
- Sir-
- That's an order.

378
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,941
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

379
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:15,698
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

380
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,367
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

381
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,703
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

382
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,040
Thank you, sir.

383
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:28,002
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

384
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,591
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

385
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:36,385
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

386
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,513
I thought so.

387
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:44,143
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

388
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:47,021
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

389
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:50,149
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

390
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,693
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

391
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,737
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

392
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,740
Everybody knows who he is.

393
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,076
You made your point.

394
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,453
I want you to keep your mustache.

395
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,082
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

396
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,085
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

397
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,962
I'd like that, sir.

398
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,090
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

399
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,591
No shit.

400
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,770
Hold it!

401
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,275
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,404
Oh, Christ!

403
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,741
Quick. Get against there.

404
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,245
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

405
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,831
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

406
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:34,545
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

407
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,006
Poli- I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

408
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,092
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

409
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:44,639
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

410
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:48,684
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

411
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:52,104
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

412
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,024
Oh, shit.

413
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:59,737
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

414
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,830
Holy shit.

415
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:11,040
Look at that mess.

416
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,421
Filling out forms till next month.

417
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,257
Good.

418
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,425
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

419
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,761
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

420
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:26,347
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

421
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,682
Good. You should.

422
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:31,477
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

423
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:34,897
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

424
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,529
You motherfucker.

425
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:48,953
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

426
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,302
Here.

427
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,723
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

428
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:12,768
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

429
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,939
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

430
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,901
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

431
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:23,821
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

432
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,450
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

433
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:32,288
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

434
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,624
Among users of the drug...

435
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,084
a marijuana cigarette...

436
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:40,296
is referred to as reefer...

437
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,800
stick, roach, joint.

438
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:48,763
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

439
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,765
tea, boo...

440
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,935
stuff, grass.

441
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,022
Hey, this is real good shit.

442
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,567
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

443
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:05,363
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

444
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,616
And I have to have some,
and I love you- I love it.

445
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,829
Have some of that. We have
nothing to- I have to have a dime?

446
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,832
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

447
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:18,960
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

448
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,838
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

449
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,215
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

450
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:27,635
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

451
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,390
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

452
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,851
Me? You!

453
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,186
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

454
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,689
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

455
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,232
The two of us.

456
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,236
Give me.

457
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,282
Where you supposed
to go from here?

458
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:53,953
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

459
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,874
You?

460
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:01,002
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

461
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,589
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

462
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,760
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

463
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,180
No fouryears in plainclothes?

464
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:15,933
Who do you know?

465
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:19,854
I make it my business to know
people- people who can help.

466
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,355
Unfair.

467
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,650
Unfair.

468
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,028
Life is unfair, pal.

469
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:30,573
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

470
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,159
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

471
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:37,121
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

472
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:39,790
I wonder ifwe can get candy
out of this machine though.

473
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,757
No, thanks.

474
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:55,014
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

475
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,811
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

476
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:07,902
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

477
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,029
unless you marry me.

478
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,000
What about the theater
and your dancing?

479
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,170
A girl has to get
married sometime.

480
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,299
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

481
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,469
I thought you were committed.

482
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:36,806
I am, but...

483
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,810
You are, but?

484
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,982
I can go on working,
studying there.

485
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,693
Where? Fort Worth?

486
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,404
Amarillo.

487
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,124
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

488
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:07,336
I'll ask Roy.

489
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:15,344
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

490
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,388
Here you go.

491
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,350
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

492
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:25,813
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

493
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:28,232
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

494
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:31,444
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

495
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,665
Been holding this for you.

496
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,210
It's from Jewish Max.

497
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,643
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

498
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:50,356
This is great, Frank.

499
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:55,236
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

500
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:56,904
It's scary.

501
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:00,825
I wanna protect myself.

502
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:03,077
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

503
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,746
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

504
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:14,463
Kellogg- Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

505
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:18,092
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

506
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:20,469
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

507
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:22,805
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

508
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,974
He owes me.
You understand?

509
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,477
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

510
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:33,107
Frank, trust me.

511
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:49,624
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

512
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:51,959
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

513
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:58,341
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

514
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:01,260
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

515
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,519
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

516
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,730
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

517
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,358
You have two alternatives.

518
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:18,778
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

519
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,113
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

520
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:24,659
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

521
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:26,661
Word will get out.

522
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:30,665
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

523
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:39,715
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

524
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:44,053
Well, what do I do with this?

525
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:08,411
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

526
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:14,917
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

527
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:24,051
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

528
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:37,773
Alfie, come on.

529
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:01,422
Is that Bjoerling?

530
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,805
No. It's DiStefano.

531
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:14,560
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

532
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:24,362
You could hear it
better over here.

533
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:27,448
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

534
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:30,034
For coffee.

535
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:34,789
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

536
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:38,000
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

537
00:48:39,794 --> 00:48:41,003
Not me.

538
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,339
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

539
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:48,135
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

540
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:51,472
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

541
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:59,021
Love my garden.

542
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:03,067
Okay. I love your garden.

543
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,487
You know what they say,
don't you?

544
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,365
No. What do they say?

545
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:13,536
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

546
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:21,961
You like her, Alfie?

547
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:26,174
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

548
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:28,676
I gotta get out of the 93.

549
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:32,054
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

550
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:36,100
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

551
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,977
It was like
the kiss of death.

552
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:41,314
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

553
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:44,025
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

554
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:48,070
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

555
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:51,616
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

556
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:53,284
Come on, Alfie.

557
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:57,997
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

558
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,666
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

559
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,795
No, you're the first.

560
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:08,382
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

561
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:12,595
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

562
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:14,972
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

563
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:17,183
- God bless you.
- Right.

564
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:28,820
Frank, Captain McCIain here.

565
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,988
Captain McCIain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

566
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,490
Sure.

567
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:41,499
Yeah. Sorry.

568
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,501
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

569
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:47,088
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

570
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:49,549
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

571
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:53,344
I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...

572
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:57,390
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

573
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:58,683
He was delighted.

574
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:02,770
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

575
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:04,856
Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.

576
00:51:07,483 --> 00:51:10,069
When did you start doing that?

577
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,198
McCIain says that Palmer says...

578
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,659
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

579
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,872
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

580
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:28,045
Plainclothes division.

581
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,299
Upstairs.

582
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:44,896
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

583
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:47,023
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

584
00:51:47,106 --> 00:51:50,234
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

585
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,154
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

586
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:56,574
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

587
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,701
Listen, take-
I'll see youse later, all right?

588
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:01,162
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

589
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:03,247
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

590
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:08,503
Deckk the halls
with boughs ofholly

591
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,761
Ten grand, Dallas-
if Minnesota. Right.

592
00:52:16,844 --> 00:52:18,513
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

593
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:22,558
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

594
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,644
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

595
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:27,480
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

596
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:29,607
Bullshit.

597
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,442
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

598
00:52:31,526 --> 00:52:33,778
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

599
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,907
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

600
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,159
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

601
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:43,079
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

602
00:52:43,162 --> 00:52:45,790
- Three.
- Three?

603
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:47,500
You heard me.

604
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:51,796
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

605
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:58,719
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

606
00:52:58,803 --> 00:53:00,721
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

607
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:02,223
I better check in.

608
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:07,520
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

609
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:14,068
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

610
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:18,447
Here you go, Frank.

611
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:21,117
It was your collar.
Keep it.

612
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:25,079
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

613
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:29,625
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

614
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,335
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

615
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:34,046
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

616
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,925
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

617
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,511
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

618
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:44,056
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

619
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,893
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

620
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,770
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

621
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:53,191
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

622
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,195
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

623
00:53:57,278 --> 00:54:00,072
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

624
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:07,622
We're not doing
anything bad here.

625
00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:10,374
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

626
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,461
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

627
00:54:13,544 --> 00:54:15,463
Come on, Frank.

628
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:18,841
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

629
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:21,427
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

630
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:24,639
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

631
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:27,683
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

632
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:30,394
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

633
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:33,773
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

634
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:35,858
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

635
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,237
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

636
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:41,405
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

637
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,991
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

638
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:47,286
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

639
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,665
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

640
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:52,416
It's worth it.

641
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:56,003
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

642
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:02,134
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

643
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:06,639
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

644
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,476
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

645
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,271
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

646
00:55:13,354 --> 00:55:15,982
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

647
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:18,776
when you leave the division.

648
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,904
Frankie, it's like-
it's like severance pay.

649
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:26,617
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

650
00:55:29,453 --> 00:55:31,998
Look at me. I'm shaking.

651
00:55:36,085 --> 00:55:38,421
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

652
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:40,882
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

653
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,554
I remember this one time...

654
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,891
there was...

655
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,476
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

656
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,479
Somebody stabbed somebody.

657
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:57,940
And...

658
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:00,568
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

659
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:04,989
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

660
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:06,991
I went over to see
what was going on.

661
00:56:07,074 --> 00:56:10,286
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

662
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:12,788
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

663
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:17,335
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

664
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:19,587
Nobody knew.

665
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,840
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

666
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,550
that crowd there.

667
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:28,054
All of a sudden...

668
00:56:28,137 --> 00:56:30,181
the crowd just parted...

669
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:32,600
Like the Red Sea, you see?

670
00:56:32,683 --> 00:56:36,270
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

671
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:38,147
"They know."

672
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:42,276
What do they know?
What do they know?

673
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,742
It's amazing.

674
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,786
It's incredible...

675
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,832
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

676
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:02,421
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

677
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:03,923
I wonder why.

678
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:05,591
Come here.

679
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:11,639
- Right there.
- Here?

680
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:16,727
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

681
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:19,063
Do you like cops?

682
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:21,107
You're my first.

683
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:26,154
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

684
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:27,822
Why not?

685
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,784
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

686
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:35,496
What's the matter with me?

687
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,665
Everybody knows about cops.

688
00:57:38,749 --> 00:57:41,377
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

689
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,589
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

690
00:57:45,673 --> 00:57:50,094
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

691
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:53,598
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

692
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,641
That's where everybody drank.

693
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:59,353
One night,
this witch came along...

694
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:01,355
and she poisoned the well.

695
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,568
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

696
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,737
and they all went crazy.

697
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:10,072
They got together
in the street and they said...

698
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:13,117
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

699
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:18,706
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

700
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:21,584
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

701
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:25,755
because their king
had regained his reason.

702
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,427
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

703
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:33,304
- Me?
- Yeah.

704
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:37,808
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

705
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:41,813
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

706
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:46,275
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

707
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,444
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

708
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:53,950
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

709
00:58:53,991 --> 00:58:56,953
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

710
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:59,330
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

711
00:58:59,413 --> 00:59:01,499
No. We'll be okay.

712
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:03,417
We're paisans, huh?

713
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:08,464
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

714
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:11,300
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

715
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:14,512
He goes to track down heroin.

716
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:17,265
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

717
00:59:17,348 --> 00:59:19,809
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

718
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,272
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

719
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:31,279
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

720
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,407
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

721
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:39,412
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

722
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:46,627
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

723
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:50,756
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

724
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,925
me and two other bagmen.

725
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,469
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

726
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,433
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

727
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:03,728
Hey!
Look, there he is.

728
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:18,659
Son of a bitch!

729
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:26,000
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

730
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:41,492
Where's the money?

731
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,961
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

732
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:54,338
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

733
01:01:58,593 --> 01:02:00,428
Three times you never show,
right?

734
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:04,724
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

735
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,726
Don't bust me!

736
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:11,272
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

737
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:15,485
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

738
01:02:16,944 --> 01:02:18,988
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

739
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:23,159
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

740
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:28,122
All right, Frank.

741
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:36,756
I keep this place
for socializing.

742
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:40,259
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

743
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:48,601
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

744
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:55,817
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

745
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,611
Look, Don...

746
01:02:58,694 --> 01:03:03,115
if I was broke, if I had a family-
I don't know.

747
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,159
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

748
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,578
So why the fuck stick my neck out?

749
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,706
It's already out, Frank-
not taking the money.

750
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,959
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

751
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,961
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

752
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:18,214
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

753
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:21,259
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

754
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,719
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

755
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:25,888
Hey. Look at that.

756
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,350
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

757
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,690
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

758
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:39,193
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

759
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:57,962
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

760
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:08,723
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

761
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:18,524
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

762
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,820
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

763
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:24,906
No, absolutely not.

764
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:26,949
All right, all right.

765
01:04:30,328 --> 01:04:33,414
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

766
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:37,543
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

767
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:40,338
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

768
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:42,757
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

769
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:46,177
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

770
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:49,931
When do I hear from him?

771
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:53,142
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

772
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:57,021
Reach out?

773
01:04:59,148 --> 01:05:01,818
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

774
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:04,111
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

775
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:06,823
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

776
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:08,449
Patience and faith.

777
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:11,869
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

778
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:13,871
he'll get in touch with you.

779
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,291
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

780
01:05:32,306 --> 01:05:34,934
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

781
01:05:35,017 --> 01:05:37,603
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

782
01:05:37,687 --> 01:05:40,273
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

783
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:43,276
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

784
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,404
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

785
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:48,322
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

786
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:51,951
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

787
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:53,619
- How are you?
- Fine.

788
01:05:53,703 --> 01:05:56,747
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

789
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:58,916
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

790
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,544
You the new bagman,
you prick?

791
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:05,965
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

792
01:06:06,048 --> 01:06:07,967
Wait a minute.

793
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,648
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

794
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:24,901
what the fuck am I doing?

795
01:06:26,944 --> 01:06:29,572
You know,
if this ever came out...

796
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:31,616
Christ, my family.

797
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:34,619
My daughter.

798
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,372
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

799
01:06:38,456 --> 01:06:39,790
Chorus.

800
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,960
Took a lot of money.

801
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:46,964
I once tried to pull out.

802
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:49,217
Christ, they were all over me.

803
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,344
So you...

804
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,346
just go along.

805
01:06:57,183 --> 01:06:59,727
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

806
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:19,956
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

807
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,752
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

808
01:07:25,753 --> 01:07:28,089
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

809
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,758
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

810
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,302
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

811
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:36,931
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

812
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:41,978
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

813
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,151
Your nut-
where's it been going?

814
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,777
Ask Rubello.

815
01:07:52,363 --> 01:07:54,490
All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myselfthen.

816
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:58,161
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

817
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:01,914
- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.

818
01:08:01,998 --> 01:08:04,458
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

819
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,794
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

820
01:08:12,258 --> 01:08:15,386
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

821
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:19,640
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

822
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:22,018
The top guys have been
cops too long.

823
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:25,980
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

824
01:08:26,063 --> 01:08:27,732
No, not a fucking word.

825
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:36,532
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

826
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:39,327
Where could we go?

827
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,830
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

828
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:53,508
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

829
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:56,302
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

830
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:59,096
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

831
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,182
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

832
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:07,939
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

833
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:10,858
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

834
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:16,113
Dynamite.

835
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:19,325
Every plainclothes man
in the division...

836
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:21,702
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

837
01:09:21,786 --> 01:09:25,790
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

838
01:09:25,873 --> 01:09:29,085
That is 150...

839
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:32,213
That is $250,000 a year...

840
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:35,299
but that is just one precinct.

841
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:38,052
Oh, that is amazing!

842
01:09:39,053 --> 01:09:42,682
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

843
01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:45,893
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

844
01:09:46,686 --> 01:09:48,813
McCIain and Delaney...

845
01:09:48,896 --> 01:09:51,357
they have done nothing?

846
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,151
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

847
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,574
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

848
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:01,242
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

849
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:02,577
Oh, right.

850
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,538
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

851
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,834
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

852
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:15,381
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

853
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:17,675
Really, Frank, I mean...

854
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:20,636
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

855
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,638
for what you've been
going through, man.

856
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,474
Wow.

857
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:31,564
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

858
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:34,400
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

859
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:52,877
Well?

860
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:56,672
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

861
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,674
I'd like a drink.

862
01:11:04,138 --> 01:11:06,390
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

863
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:13,564
To the mayor!

864
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:18,444
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

865
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:20,446
You know that?

866
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:26,410
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

867
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,206
It's like a personal defeat.

868
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,876
However...

869
01:11:33,918 --> 01:11:35,878
there are priorities.

870
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,381
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

871
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:40,550
The priorities are...

872
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:43,052
a long, hot summer ahead...

873
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:45,847
and riots are expected...

874
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:51,102
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

875
01:11:51,185 --> 01:11:53,980
Now, in the fall...

876
01:11:54,063 --> 01:11:56,899
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

877
01:11:56,983 --> 01:11:58,901
to take another look
at the situation.

878
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:00,778
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

879
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,586
They're all rotten.

880
01:12:16,669 --> 01:12:18,754
Chickenshit.

881
01:12:18,838 --> 01:12:20,882
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

882
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:27,972
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

883
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:35,563
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

884
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:37,565
Let him in.

885
01:12:39,275 --> 01:12:41,235
You let him in.

886
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:02,632
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

887
01:13:02,715 --> 01:13:05,801
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

888
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,514
"Wow. Amazing!

889
01:13:09,597 --> 01:13:13,434
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

890
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:15,436
Priorities. Priorities."

891
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,481
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

892
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:20,817
your big bullshit names.

893
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,653
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

894
01:13:23,736 --> 01:13:26,697
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

895
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,908
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

896
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:31,744
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

897
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:33,996
with your humble-pie act-
the saint, the injured innocent.

898
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,998
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

899
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:38,626
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

900
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:45,007
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

901
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:48,511
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

902
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,513
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

903
01:13:50,596 --> 01:13:53,057
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

904
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:56,269
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

905
01:13:57,353 --> 01:13:59,147
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

906
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,941
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

907
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:05,278
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

908
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:07,572
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

909
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:10,241
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

910
01:14:10,283 --> 01:14:12,785
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

911
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:14,537
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

912
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,248
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

913
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,750
We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.

914
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,630
Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.

915
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:27,925
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

916
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,468
This is safe, Frank.

917
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,345
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

918
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:35,057
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

919
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:37,185
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

920
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:38,811
- Go fuckyourself!
- Fuckyou!

921
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:45,610
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

922
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:49,197
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

923
01:15:30,154 --> 01:15:32,156
Honey...

924
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,325
come to bed.

925
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:45,271
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

926
01:16:45,354 --> 01:16:49,233
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

927
01:16:52,236 --> 01:16:56,115
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

928
01:16:56,199 --> 01:17:00,995
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

929
01:17:01,037 --> 01:17:03,623
he'd give it back to me.

930
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:06,250
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

931
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:10,046
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

932
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:13,841
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

933
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:17,678
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one ofyou...

934
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,475
makes his own collections-
no stops, no bread, okay?

935
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:24,477
- Right.
- You got it.

936
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,689
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

937
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:33,361
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

938
01:17:33,444 --> 01:17:35,154
You can always give it
to charity.

939
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:39,742
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

940
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:44,372
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

941
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:52,421
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

942
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,465
You're a schmuck, Frank.

943
01:18:02,473 --> 01:18:04,934
If they would take
all that energy, see...

944
01:18:05,017 --> 01:18:07,103
put it into
straight police work...

945
01:18:07,186 --> 01:18:08,563
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

946
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:11,065
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

947
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:20,741
If I could work alone-
That's the thing, see?

948
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:23,494
If I could just get- Work alone.
But they don't like that.

949
01:18:23,578 --> 01:18:25,663
They don't want that.
They want to suckyou in.

950
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:28,499
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

951
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:32,795
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

952
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:36,048
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

953
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,759
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

954
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:42,305
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

955
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:45,850
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

956
01:18:45,933 --> 01:18:49,770
Eitheryou're exploding, oryou're
Iying around like a catatonic!

957
01:18:49,854 --> 01:18:53,316
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

958
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:56,694
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

959
01:18:56,736 --> 01:19:00,364
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

960
01:19:00,406 --> 01:19:03,826
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

961
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,828
It's tearing me apart!

962
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:09,457
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

963
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:13,377
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

964
01:19:13,419 --> 01:19:18,841
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

965
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:22,720
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

966
01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:26,808
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

967
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:29,560
Well, do it.

968
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:46,327
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

969
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:48,329
Try me. Try me.

970
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,375
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

971
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:56,128
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

972
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:59,048
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

973
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,678
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

974
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,264
This mother's so cocksure...

975
01:20:06,347 --> 01:20:09,600
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

976
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:11,102
Where's the drop?

977
01:20:58,524 --> 01:20:59,775
Hold it!

978
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:02,528
I'm a police officer.

979
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:03,946
And...

980
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:09,118
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

981
01:21:10,578 --> 01:21:13,498
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

982
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,460
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

983
01:21:17,543 --> 01:21:19,754
What are you doin'?
What's that?

984
01:21:21,255 --> 01:21:24,258
Put that away, oryou're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

985
01:21:30,056 --> 01:21:32,225
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

986
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:34,393
Wouldn't you like to know?

987
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:39,232
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

988
01:21:39,315 --> 01:21:41,275
I'm gonna search his car.

989
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,134
Where's Corsaro?

990
01:22:06,217 --> 01:22:08,136
Smith took him upstairs.

991
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:20,565
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

992
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:25,319
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

993
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:38,666
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

994
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:42,879
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

995
01:22:42,962 --> 01:22:46,215
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

996
01:22:46,299 --> 01:22:48,759
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

997
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:51,596
You're fucking right!

998
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,348
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

999
01:22:54,432 --> 01:22:57,059
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

1000
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,479
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

1001
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,106
Stay the fuck outta this!

1002
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:05,151
You fuck!

1003
01:23:06,444 --> 01:23:08,571
What's this?
What's this?

1004
01:23:08,654 --> 01:23:10,573
Get in! Get in!

1005
01:23:59,705 --> 01:24:03,417
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

1006
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:20,309
You want to read something?

1007
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:24,689
It's about your pal Corsaro.

1008
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:27,525
Here, read it.
Read it!

1009
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:33,156
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

1010
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:36,325
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

1011
01:24:48,004 --> 01:24:50,131
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

1012
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:52,842
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

1013
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:55,470
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

1014
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:59,140
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

1015
01:24:59,182 --> 01:25:02,143
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

1016
01:25:02,226 --> 01:25:05,146
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

1017
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:09,400
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

1018
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,944
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

1019
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:14,197
What outside agencies?

1020
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,534
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

1021
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:23,289
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

1022
01:25:23,372 --> 01:25:24,790
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

1023
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:28,002
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

1024
01:25:28,044 --> 01:25:31,798
- If I have to go to outside agencies-
- Stay away from outside agencies!

1025
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,841
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

1026
01:25:33,883 --> 01:25:36,135
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1027
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:38,095
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

1028
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:41,432
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

1029
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,521
It's my life, you fuck!

1030
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:51,400
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

1031
01:25:59,408 --> 01:26:01,327
For this precinct,
cases reported...

1032
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:06,999
Murder- 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

1033
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,337
Inspector Palmer?

1034
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:17,051
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1035
01:26:17,093 --> 01:26:19,220
are waiting to see you.

1036
01:26:22,598 --> 01:26:24,851
You want to come
to my office?

1037
01:26:31,023 --> 01:26:33,401
Captain McCIain called me.

1038
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:35,570
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1039
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:38,114
on your allegations.

1040
01:26:38,197 --> 01:26:42,743
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

1041
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:46,747
Well...

1042
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:52,837
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

1043
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,339
you told...

1044
01:26:55,423 --> 01:26:58,009
I mean,
you told Captain McCIain...

1045
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:00,511
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

1046
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:04,307
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

1047
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,476
My record's clear.

1048
01:27:06,559 --> 01:27:08,686
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

1049
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:10,688
confidential
investigation unit.

1050
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:14,609
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

1051
01:27:16,986 --> 01:27:18,404
I don't understand.

1052
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:21,115
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1053
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:25,995
No, I didn't hear a thing.

1054
01:27:26,078 --> 01:27:29,248
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

1055
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:31,417
believe me.

1056
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:34,629
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

1057
01:27:34,712 --> 01:27:36,798
out of a paper bag,
right?

1058
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:42,553
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

1059
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,980
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1060
01:27:54,607 --> 01:27:57,860
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1061
01:27:57,944 --> 01:27:59,862
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

1062
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:02,406
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1063
01:28:05,326 --> 01:28:07,286
Well, I...

1064
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:09,413
I'll have to think that...

1065
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:11,999
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

1066
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:15,211
What is there
to think about?

1067
01:28:15,294 --> 01:28:18,005
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

1068
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:23,052
You've got a point there.

1069
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:26,931
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

1070
01:28:29,809 --> 01:28:34,605
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

1071
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:39,735
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

1072
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:42,405
That's fair enough.

1073
01:28:42,446 --> 01:28:44,407
We'll be in touch.

1074
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,496
Inspector Palmer?

1075
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,665
May I see you a minute?

1076
01:28:58,045 --> 01:29:00,131
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

1077
01:29:00,214 --> 01:29:02,967
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

1078
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:05,386
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

1079
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:06,846
is warranted?

1080
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:10,600
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

1081
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:17,064
But, sir...

1082
01:29:17,148 --> 01:29:19,650
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1083
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:24,489
No.
You're all experienced men.

1084
01:29:26,574 --> 01:29:28,951
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1085
01:29:34,999 --> 01:29:36,417
Commissioner...

1086
01:29:39,086 --> 01:29:42,799
Serpico claims that...

1087
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:46,135
McCIain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

1088
01:29:46,219 --> 01:29:49,972
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

1089
01:29:54,644 --> 01:29:59,273
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

1090
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:01,359
We need a location!

1091
01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:04,320
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1092
01:30:04,362 --> 01:30:08,032
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1093
01:30:08,115 --> 01:30:10,952
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

1094
01:30:10,993 --> 01:30:13,079
Lieutenant Smith-
Let's get back to him.

1095
01:30:13,162 --> 01:30:17,500
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

1096
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:21,379
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

1097
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,548
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

1098
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:26,425
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

1099
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,982
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

1100
01:30:41,065 --> 01:30:44,861
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1101
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:49,448
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1102
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,450
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

1103
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:56,497
He's clean.

1104
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:58,040
Right?

1105
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:03,087
You practicing your frisk?

1106
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:09,135
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1107
01:31:12,346 --> 01:31:16,017
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

1108
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,518
Come on, Frank.

1109
01:31:17,602 --> 01:31:22,648
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1110
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:25,693
I'm not testifying.

1111
01:31:25,776 --> 01:31:27,945
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1112
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:31,491
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1113
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:41,417
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

1114
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:42,919
Yeah, I watch television.

1115
01:31:43,002 --> 01:31:47,381
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1116
01:31:47,465 --> 01:31:49,383
It's unique.

1117
01:31:49,467 --> 01:31:53,471
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

1118
01:31:53,554 --> 01:31:56,599
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

1119
01:31:56,682 --> 01:31:59,894
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

1120
01:31:59,977 --> 01:32:03,523
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1121
01:32:03,606 --> 01:32:05,024
'cause I'm not testifying.

1122
01:32:05,107 --> 01:32:08,194
- Listen-
- Wait just a second, Frank.

1123
01:32:08,277 --> 01:32:10,613
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1124
01:32:10,696 --> 01:32:13,032
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1125
01:32:13,115 --> 01:32:14,867
- Wait a minute-
- if it meant something...

1126
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:17,328
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

1127
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,122
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

1128
01:32:20,206 --> 01:32:21,916
the division, the Bronx.

1129
01:32:21,999 --> 01:32:23,918
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

1130
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:27,046
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

1131
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:30,007
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

1132
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:08,629
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

1133
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:10,298
I'm splitting.

1134
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:12,467
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

1135
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:15,887
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1136
01:33:15,928 --> 01:33:18,139
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1137
01:33:18,222 --> 01:33:20,183
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

1138
01:33:20,224 --> 01:33:22,310
I can shout anywhere!

1139
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,400
I won't shout.

1140
01:33:31,027 --> 01:33:32,570
Sit down, sit down.

1141
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,960
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

1142
01:33:48,044 --> 01:33:50,129
It isn't gonna
get any better.

1143
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:54,550
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1144
01:34:03,726 --> 01:34:05,853
How could you leave
the man you love...

1145
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:09,023
future father of your kids?

1146
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:14,487
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1147
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:19,909
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

1148
01:34:22,203 --> 01:34:25,706
You want to be free
and unattached...

1149
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:29,210
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1150
01:34:29,293 --> 01:34:30,711
My cause.

1151
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:37,468
I felt so safe with you...

1152
01:34:38,845 --> 01:34:40,847
so loving.

1153
01:34:50,523 --> 01:34:51,941
Stay with me, Laurie.

1154
01:34:55,278 --> 01:34:57,196
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

1155
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,462
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

1156
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:14,464
Here.

1157
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:15,965
Here's $2:00.

1158
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,359
What are you doing?

1159
01:35:39,947 --> 01:35:41,407
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

1160
01:35:43,242 --> 01:35:44,660
I'm not gonna walk away.

1161
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:48,122
It's finished!

1162
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:59,550
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1163
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:03,387
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

1164
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:07,767
Look, maybe if you were borough
commanderwhen this thing started...

1165
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:11,229
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1166
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,606
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1167
01:36:13,689 --> 01:36:18,027
You're like a quiffwho says
she won't, then maybe she will.

1168
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:20,696
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

1169
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,700
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McCIain, Delaney...

1170
01:36:24,784 --> 01:36:27,703
I'm not Kellogg,
McCIain or Delaney!

1171
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:30,581
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

1172
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:33,376
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

1173
01:36:33,459 --> 01:36:36,629
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

1174
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:39,173
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1175
01:36:39,257 --> 01:36:42,009
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

1176
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:45,596
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

1177
01:36:45,638 --> 01:36:49,100
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

1178
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:53,020
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

1179
01:36:53,104 --> 01:36:54,772
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

1180
01:36:54,856 --> 01:36:57,567
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1181
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:59,485
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

1182
01:36:59,569 --> 01:37:02,113
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

1183
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:05,324
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1184
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:08,327
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

1185
01:37:08,411 --> 01:37:10,788
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

1186
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:13,749
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

1187
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:16,961
Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shtickklech.

1188
01:37:17,044 --> 01:37:19,172
I don't understand.

1189
01:37:19,255 --> 01:37:21,215
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1190
01:37:23,718 --> 01:37:27,388
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1191
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:39,358
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.

1192
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,236
Ready on the firing line.

1193
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,830
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1194
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,167
Depends on
what they ask me.

1195
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:40,711
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

1196
01:38:40,795 --> 01:38:43,047
What I don't know,
I don't know.

1197
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:45,842
But you do know, Frank.

1198
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:49,929
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

1199
01:38:50,012 --> 01:38:54,350
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1200
01:38:54,392 --> 01:38:57,979
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

1201
01:38:58,062 --> 01:39:00,857
I mean, there's lots ofways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1202
01:39:00,898 --> 01:39:03,067
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1203
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:06,362
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1204
01:39:06,445 --> 01:39:08,531
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

1205
01:39:08,614 --> 01:39:10,825
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

1206
01:39:14,954 --> 01:39:17,331
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

1207
01:39:20,626 --> 01:39:23,212
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1208
01:39:24,297 --> 01:39:26,549
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

1209
01:39:26,632 --> 01:39:29,302
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

1210
01:39:29,385 --> 01:39:31,304
more than a year
and a half ago.

1211
01:39:31,387 --> 01:39:34,724
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

1212
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:37,477
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

1213
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,606
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

1214
01:39:41,689 --> 01:39:44,859
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

1215
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:49,655
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1216
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,949
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

1217
01:39:52,033 --> 01:39:55,620
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1218
01:39:55,703 --> 01:39:57,997
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

1219
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,999
Quite the contrary.

1220
01:40:00,082 --> 01:40:03,586
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1221
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:07,089
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1222
01:40:07,173 --> 01:40:10,176
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1223
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:14,722
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1224
01:40:14,806 --> 01:40:17,600
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

1225
01:40:17,683 --> 01:40:20,353
actively engaged in corruption.

1226
01:40:20,436 --> 01:40:23,064
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1227
01:40:23,147 --> 01:40:27,109
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

1228
01:40:27,151 --> 01:40:30,738
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

1229
01:40:30,822 --> 01:40:33,533
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

1230
01:40:33,574 --> 01:40:36,869
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

1231
01:40:36,911 --> 01:40:39,789
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1232
01:40:39,872 --> 01:40:42,458
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

1233
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:45,211
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

1234
01:40:45,294 --> 01:40:47,213
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

1235
01:40:47,255 --> 01:40:49,674
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

1236
01:40:49,757 --> 01:40:52,176
All right! Look, Frank.

1237
01:40:53,052 --> 01:40:56,013
You got guts, integrity.

1238
01:40:56,097 --> 01:40:59,058
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1239
01:41:01,769 --> 01:41:05,231
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

1240
01:41:05,314 --> 01:41:06,899
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

1241
01:41:06,983 --> 01:41:08,860
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

1242
01:41:08,943 --> 01:41:11,237
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1243
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,493
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

1244
01:41:17,577 --> 01:41:20,913
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

1245
01:41:32,842 --> 01:41:35,595
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1246
01:41:35,678 --> 01:41:37,722
You expecting an army?

1247
01:41:37,763 --> 01:41:39,724
No, just a division.

1248
01:41:41,642 --> 01:41:46,189
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

1249
01:41:46,272 --> 01:41:48,941
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

1250
01:41:49,025 --> 01:41:52,236
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1251
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,407
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

1252
01:41:56,491 --> 01:41:58,075
would convince
a lot of people...

1253
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,702
Not while I'm commissioner.

1254
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,348
Commander's office?

1255
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:24,769
It's down that corridor.

1256
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:30,483
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1257
01:42:30,566 --> 01:42:33,444
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

1258
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:36,405
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1259
01:42:38,574 --> 01:42:40,243
It isn't so.

1260
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:43,412
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1261
01:42:44,664 --> 01:42:46,624
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

1262
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:54,173
Don't move.

1263
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:18,531
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1264
01:43:26,789 --> 01:43:29,792
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1265
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:33,796
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1266
01:43:35,548 --> 01:43:37,008
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1267
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:44,307
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1268
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:50,730
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

1269
01:43:50,813 --> 01:43:53,024
I'll work with you.

1270
01:43:53,107 --> 01:43:55,026
Is that all right?

1271
01:44:05,745 --> 01:44:07,747
How do we get past
the lookouts?

1272
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,540
How many you got?
One.

1273
01:44:12,084 --> 01:44:14,712
There's two.

1274
01:44:14,796 --> 01:44:17,590
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

1275
01:44:17,673 --> 01:44:19,842
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

1276
01:44:19,926 --> 01:44:22,011
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

1277
01:44:23,638 --> 01:44:25,973
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1278
01:45:09,016 --> 01:45:11,102
What do you think?
Want to try it?

1279
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:31,831
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

1280
01:45:31,873 --> 01:45:33,833
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

1281
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:36,169
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1282
01:46:04,572 --> 01:46:06,157
Close up!

1283
01:46:08,993 --> 01:46:10,995
Wait, Frank!

1284
01:46:11,078 --> 01:46:12,538
Come on!

1285
01:46:21,964 --> 01:46:23,382
I ain't got nothing!

1286
01:46:25,593 --> 01:46:27,553
Beat it, fuck face!

1287
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:32,183
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

1288
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:38,356
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

1289
01:46:38,397 --> 01:46:40,233
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

1290
01:46:40,316 --> 01:46:42,944
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

1291
01:46:43,027 --> 01:46:46,697
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

1292
01:46:46,739 --> 01:46:49,408
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

1293
01:46:49,492 --> 01:46:52,620
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

1294
01:46:55,206 --> 01:46:56,874
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

1295
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:59,043
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1296
01:47:00,711 --> 01:47:03,214
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

1297
01:47:03,256 --> 01:47:05,341
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1298
01:47:05,424 --> 01:47:08,594
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1299
01:47:09,637 --> 01:47:14,225
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

1300
01:47:14,308 --> 01:47:17,728
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

1301
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:22,525
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1302
01:47:22,608 --> 01:47:25,611
The pickups here are made-
You want to get this...

1303
01:47:25,695 --> 01:47:28,906
The pickups are made by...

1304
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,868
retired policemen.

1305
01:47:31,909 --> 01:47:35,413
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

1306
01:47:35,496 --> 01:47:39,750
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1307
01:47:41,586 --> 01:47:45,965
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

1308
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:49,051
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1309
01:47:57,351 --> 01:47:58,936
With all due respect,
sir...

1310
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:03,900
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

1311
01:48:03,941 --> 01:48:07,612
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

1312
01:48:07,695 --> 01:48:10,031
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

1313
01:48:10,072 --> 01:48:12,033
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1314
01:48:12,116 --> 01:48:15,661
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

1315
01:48:15,745 --> 01:48:19,165
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

1316
01:48:19,248 --> 01:48:23,127
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1317
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:26,964
That's it, huh?

1318
01:48:27,048 --> 01:48:30,718
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

1319
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,887
That's what
you want to know...

1320
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:36,224
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1321
01:48:37,767 --> 01:48:39,519
- Hello.
- Hello, prick.

1322
01:48:39,602 --> 01:48:41,729
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1323
01:48:42,605 --> 01:48:45,566
- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.

1324
01:48:46,526 --> 01:48:50,613
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

1325
01:48:50,696 --> 01:48:53,282
I don't know if
the timing is right.

1326
01:48:55,993 --> 01:48:58,788
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

1327
01:48:58,871 --> 01:49:01,290
in case something
should happen to me.

1328
01:49:04,836 --> 01:49:06,921
I want it on the record.

1329
01:49:09,966 --> 01:49:11,384
I don't know ifwe
carry enough weight.

1330
01:49:13,052 --> 01:49:15,138
I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...

1331
01:49:15,221 --> 01:49:17,473
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

1332
01:49:21,769 --> 01:49:24,522
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

1333
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:29,569
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

1334
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:33,948
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1335
01:49:34,031 --> 01:49:37,243
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

1336
01:49:37,326 --> 01:49:39,370
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

1337
01:49:39,453 --> 01:49:41,372
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

1338
01:49:41,456 --> 01:49:43,499
You said we could go
to bed late!

1339
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:48,087
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

1340
01:49:48,171 --> 01:49:52,467
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

1341
01:49:52,508 --> 01:49:54,594
If I left the force...

1342
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:58,097
I don't know
what I could do.

1343
01:50:03,895 --> 01:50:07,815
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

1344
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:15,031
Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.

1345
01:50:15,114 --> 01:50:17,033
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

1346
01:50:17,116 --> 01:50:18,534
Newsweek, please.

1347
01:50:20,953 --> 01:50:22,872
Holy sh- Jeez!

1348
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,834
Aw, Christ!

1349
01:50:26,918 --> 01:50:29,796
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1350
01:50:29,837 --> 01:50:32,089
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1351
01:50:32,173 --> 01:50:35,134
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1352
01:50:35,218 --> 01:50:39,847
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1353
01:50:39,931 --> 01:50:43,100
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

1354
01:50:43,184 --> 01:50:46,020
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

1355
01:50:46,103 --> 01:50:49,148
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1356
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:50,650
Unbelievable!

1357
01:50:54,946 --> 01:50:59,325
The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...

1358
01:50:59,408 --> 01:51:01,410
of McCarthyism.

1359
01:51:01,494 --> 01:51:05,957
- I have issued a statement-
- We here at city hall...

1360
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,751
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

1361
01:51:08,835 --> 01:51:10,753
to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.

1362
01:51:10,837 --> 01:51:12,255
Yeah, come.

1363
01:51:17,301 --> 01:51:22,765
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1364
01:51:22,849 --> 01:51:25,977
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

1365
01:51:30,773 --> 01:51:32,692
I miss you already, Frank.

1366
01:51:37,738 --> 01:51:40,950
Look, Frank...

1367
01:51:43,661 --> 01:51:46,330
it's narcotics.

1368
01:51:46,414 --> 01:51:48,958
You be careful.

1369
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,503
It's very easy to get hurt...

1370
01:51:54,046 --> 01:51:55,465
and to...

1371
01:51:57,049 --> 01:51:58,759
to be set up.

1372
01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:42,845
Get in.

1373
01:52:59,779 --> 01:53:01,864
You're not wired,
are you?

1374
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:04,867
Okay, you cocksucker.

1375
01:53:06,369 --> 01:53:09,372
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

1376
01:53:09,455 --> 01:53:12,875
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1377
01:53:14,502 --> 01:53:17,255
Last week,
one dope dealer...

1378
01:53:17,338 --> 01:53:20,383
sent out these guys
making pickups.

1379
01:53:20,466 --> 01:53:22,969
40,000 each.

1380
01:53:23,052 --> 01:53:26,347
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

1381
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:30,017
120,000 split four ways.

1382
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,479
That's serious money.

1383
01:53:33,563 --> 01:53:37,108
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1384
01:53:38,901 --> 01:53:41,279
- I got the message.
- Good.

1385
01:53:42,071 --> 01:53:43,531
Now get the fuck out.

1386
01:53:50,204 --> 01:53:51,622
The guy's name is Limbo.

1387
01:53:51,706 --> 01:53:54,041
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1388
01:53:54,083 --> 01:53:56,669
He's a pusher- heroin.

1389
01:53:56,752 --> 01:53:59,005
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

1390
01:53:59,088 --> 01:54:02,758
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

1391
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,886
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

1392
01:54:04,969 --> 01:54:07,513
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

1393
01:55:15,873 --> 01:55:18,334
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

1394
01:55:18,417 --> 01:55:22,004
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

1395
01:55:22,088 --> 01:55:25,383
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1396
01:55:25,466 --> 01:55:28,177
I'll take you shopping.

1397
01:57:12,824 --> 01:57:14,283
Limbo.

1398
01:57:47,692 --> 01:57:49,443
Police. Freeze!

1399
01:57:49,527 --> 01:57:51,529
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

1400
01:57:51,612 --> 01:57:55,825
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

1401
01:57:55,908 --> 01:57:58,828
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

1402
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:00,955
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

1403
01:58:01,998 --> 01:58:04,000
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo.Julio!

1404
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:06,335
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

1405
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:12,276
Police officer!

1406
01:59:22,411 --> 01:59:24,372
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

1407
01:59:25,373 --> 01:59:27,500
Go down the fire escape!

1408
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:47,353
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1409
02:00:21,596 --> 02:00:24,765
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

1410
02:00:24,849 --> 02:00:26,767
Okay. Go ahead.

1411
02:00:32,064 --> 02:00:35,026
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

1412
02:00:35,109 --> 02:00:37,570
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

1413
02:01:05,681 --> 02:01:07,600
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

1414
02:01:07,683 --> 02:01:11,771
the news is better
than we expected.

1415
02:01:11,854 --> 02:01:16,150
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

1416
02:01:16,234 --> 02:01:17,819
It didn't enter the brain...

1417
02:01:19,487 --> 02:01:21,572
or strike the spinal cord.

1418
02:01:23,074 --> 02:01:25,618
He's on the critical list...

1419
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:28,871
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1420
02:01:30,206 --> 02:01:32,041
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1421
02:02:05,992 --> 02:02:09,162
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1422
02:02:09,245 --> 02:02:10,705
What?

1423
02:02:10,788 --> 02:02:14,167
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

1424
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:26,637
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1425
02:02:33,352 --> 02:02:35,313
How are you?

1426
02:02:38,483 --> 02:02:40,902
You wanna read my fan mail?

1427
02:02:40,985 --> 02:02:42,904
Sure.

1428
02:02:42,987 --> 02:02:45,072
You're a big shot now, huh?

1429
02:03:13,309 --> 02:03:16,896
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

1430
02:03:27,698 --> 02:03:31,285
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1431
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:32,870
Naturally.

1432
02:03:37,708 --> 02:03:39,168
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

1433
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,796
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

1434
02:03:43,339 --> 02:03:45,258
That's very funny.

1435
02:03:50,555 --> 02:03:53,015
That's very funny.

1436
02:03:54,267 --> 02:03:55,685
Francesco, you love me?

1437
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:00,439
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

1438
02:04:04,902 --> 02:04:06,988
Your gold shield's
come through.

1439
02:04:35,725 --> 02:04:37,685
What's this for?

1440
02:04:41,272 --> 02:04:43,983
For being an honest cop?

1441
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,530
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1442
02:04:53,951 --> 02:04:56,913
You tell them
they can shove it.

1443
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:04,337
I don't want it.

1444
02:05:43,251 --> 02:05:44,710
Oh, well.

1445
02:05:49,882 --> 02:05:52,468
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

1446
02:05:52,552 --> 02:05:56,180
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

1447
02:05:56,222 --> 02:06:00,101
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1448
02:06:00,184 --> 02:06:02,812
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

1449
02:06:02,895 --> 02:06:04,522
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

1450
02:06:04,564 --> 02:06:07,358
andyou'll have to be checkked
from time to time.

1451
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,819
Your left side will
feel stiffioccasionally.

1452
02:06:10,987 --> 02:06:14,157
Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.

1453
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,367
But in general,
you'll be okkay.

1454
02:06:34,802 --> 02:06:37,096
Through my appearance
here today...

1455
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:40,183
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

1456
02:06:40,266 --> 02:06:43,853
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

1457
02:06:43,936 --> 02:06:47,231
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

1458
02:06:47,315 --> 02:06:50,234
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1459
02:06:50,318 --> 02:06:55,072
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

1460
02:06:55,156 --> 02:06:58,701
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1461
02:06:58,785 --> 02:07:00,745
in which an honest police officer
can act...

1462
02:07:00,787 --> 02:07:05,458
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1463
02:07:05,541 --> 02:07:09,128
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

1464
02:07:09,212 --> 02:07:11,339
at higher levels
in the department.

1465
02:07:11,422 --> 02:07:14,759
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1466
02:07:14,801 --> 02:07:18,930
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1467
02:07:19,764 --> 02:07:21,182
In order to ensure this...

1468
02:07:21,265 --> 02:07:24,227
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

1469
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:28,105
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
