1
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,666

Jacobs!

6
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,041
Kids' going missing
on Khayelitsha.

7
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,624
People coming do
on it, you know.

8
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,833
Still trying to confirm.
Any way.

9
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,459
Hi, Dan.

10
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:08,434
Where is it?

11
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,791
At Botanical gardens.

12
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,208
I will drop the boys off school
and I arrived right there...

13
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,458
Tom! Gary!

14
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,791
Hey, are you kidding me?

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,208
Go and put on your clothes.

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,015
Mom would let me...
Come on boys.

17
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,791
Did you called Brian I've
left several messages.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,291
- Sokhela.
- Hello.

19
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,374
Fletcher? Do you work
in the field now?

20
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,041
I needed to change senior.

21
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,041
You get your money as well.

22
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,833
How long the Around 20.

23
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,374
20 years old.

24

Died around 2 am, multiple
wounds no bullet.

25
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:10,874
Melee Weapons No.

26
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,999
Someone beat her to
death with the fists.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Rape?

28
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,124
Sexual intercourse.

29
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,624
Rape, I'll tell you later.

30
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,291
This is what we found on it.

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,999
Video club membership card.

32
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,334
Judith...

33
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,584
Botha.

34
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,833
What fucking you doing?
It's me.

35
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,499
Nice meet to you, boy.

36
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,666
- Speak a while...
- Fucking lunatic.

37
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,166
It's not loaded.

38
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:16,791
What are you doing here?

39
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:18,417
That is it?

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,791
The rest stashed in
the Cayman Islands.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What do you think?

42
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,624
That's we have to go
to Pension Support?

43
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:29,083
Charles! Your mom is not
exactly act as a student.

44
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,791
She has a new
boyfriend, doesn't she?

45
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,624
Dentist.

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,541
Big business!

47
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,416
So he is my Dad now?

48
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,458
And how must I pay for my flat?

49
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,916
Flat?

50
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:45,083
Yeah, Marjorie and I
are living together.

51
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Marjorie?

52
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,916
Why don't you come
and live here?

53
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:51,416
You know I got this ass for you.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,708
It's too much traffic
around here.

55
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,124
Do you even know
this one's name?

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,083
I know she's got a nice ass.

57
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,083
I stop pass grandpa's grave.

58
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,833
What's going take view of getting
around putting his name on his stone?

59
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:24,999
Come here!

60
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,249
You look like hell.

61
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,374
Me too I'm glad to see you.

62
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,333
Because she's keeping it's spirits.
She's tougher than she looks.

63
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,708
What about the kids?

64
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,458
I don't think they understand.

65
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,999
When we looks at Mother's hair.
Tom says:

66
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,583
"Mommy's leaves are falling.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
Please wait.

68
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,833
He's aged Since the World Cup.

69
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,291
I'll let you do the talking.

70
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,541
Nils Botha?

71
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,041
Hello, sir.

72
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,583
I am the Detective Dan Fletcher from
the serious violent criminal Unit.

73
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,124
And this is Detective
Brian Epkeen.

74
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,292
What's going on here?

75
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,374
Do you know where your
daughter Judith is?

76
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,041
At home, I imagine.

77
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,855
No, she's not at the flat, and
the cell phone does not answer.

78
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,166
Could you...

79
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,345
Could you please give
us her description of

80
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,249
height and

81
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,475
weight...

82
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,708
5 foot 5... (1.68 m)

83
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,791
- What's going on here?
- Something wrong, Nils?

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,541
What's going on?

85
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,583
We found the body of a young
woman in botanical gardens.

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,333
The body hasn't been
identified yet,

87
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,499
But she had a video
club membership card.

88
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,124
And her name, Judith Botha. Do you know
what your daughter did last night?

89
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,624
Judith and Nicole were
studying for the medium exams.

90
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,541
Nicole?

91
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,999
My daughter. Judith and
Nocole are close friends.

92
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,916
Thank you, Janet.

93
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,624
We, we just got hold that Judith still
on the beach with her boyfriend,

94
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,374
Phone switched off.

95
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,791
She lent her video club card to
her friend Nicole, yesterday.

96
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,708
You could do help, Judith.

97
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,124
Yes, we've done it before.

98
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:47,041
Nicole told her parents she spending
the night in my place to study,

99
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,124
tetapi pada hakikatnya,
dia keluar.

100
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,624
You know where, with whom?

101
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,232
We weren't see much
nor chat lately.

102
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,541
You are in the same university?

103
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,666
Thanks, Janet.

104
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,458
Yes. She wasn't come
to classes any more.

105
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,249
In the last three months
Something changed.

106
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,499
Like she wasn't the same person.

107
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,499
I can't explain why but...

108
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,374
she's becoming visive.

109
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:49,834
This is me.

110
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,291
Between.

111
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,624
What's going on?

112
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,416
Everything is alright.

113
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,541
A draping blood pressure.
Nothing too serious.

114
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,208
I was hanging out kids
and with other ladies.

115
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,833
Alongside Khayelitsha.

116
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,749
I got a bit of the flash.
It happens, you know.

117
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,499
You too, Mama.

118
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,083
You are working much too hard,

119
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:12,542
much too hard!

120
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,249
You know that there is
a child lost in there?

121
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,083
Have you gone to see Adams?

122
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,458
They haven't notice
anything suspect.

123
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:24,583
Naturally. Nobody cares about
these children, you know.

124
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,625
Mom...

125
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,458
You all shave talks
about you, you know.

126
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,209
Thank you.

127
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,124
Do you see the way
she's looking at you?

128
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,416
Stop.

129
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,874
Ali, she is beautiful!

130
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,624
Mom, stop it.

131
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,541
Ok, Ok. How about
Chicken and dumpling?

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,208
Sounds good?

133
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,375
Good.

134
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,541
Former rugby world
champion Stewart Weitz

135
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,874
call the press conference
late this afternoon.

136
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:02,249
Set the violent crimes lean for
Africa into just another fail of.

137
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,618
Some kind of rust beast raped
and murdered my daughter.

138
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,916
If the police in this country are incapable
offer protecting it's citizens …

139
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,124
Jika polis di negara ini tidak mampu
untuk melindungi rakyatnya...

140
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,083
Please...

141
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,666
Stop it!

142
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:31,874
Stop them!

143
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,874
Let me go!

144
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
Stop them!

145
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,834
Stop.

146
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,416
- Take I.
- Hey, what's going on?

147
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,166
Stop it!

148
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,083
Come on, boy

149
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:06,666
I just want to see how you are.

150
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,667
Get out of there!

151
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,625
How are you?

152
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,791
You are late.

153
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,291
You exactly you are
hoping to find?

154
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,583
Well, come from
the call we lead.

155
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,624
My daughter was
raped and murdered

156
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,166
by one of these degenerate

157
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,999
that hit the country.

158
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,999
You will find nothing here.

159
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,374
Yeah, but we don't know that
your daughter was raped.

160
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,833
Tick? It is the town of drug.

161
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,874
We are dealing with a rich kid.
Not an abuse.

162
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,100
No, she does.

163
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,906
The medical exam
unfold result of blood

164
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:44,066
revealed the presence of
ammonia and ephedrine.

165
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,208
We suggest she was using tik.

166
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,749
It possible some one
drugged did the abuser?

167
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,791
She has sexual intercourses,

168
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,749
but she wasn't raped.

169
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,749
A man, the priority
is to find a partner.

170
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,791
Is he the killer?

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,791
Or, he'd come forward by now.

172
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,017
It's possible.

173
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:04,666
But it could be that he just sold her
the Tick and doesn't want the problem.

174
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,333
In any case, we are
looking for him.

175
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,208
- What about the DNA samples.
- Nothing useful there.

176
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,227
- Have you spoken to the Attorney General?
- Three times already.

177
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,624
Nicole Weitz's father called

178
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,083
to complain the cop he chat
up at his place this morning.

179
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,499
Brian is a first-grade
detective. I trust him.

180
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,124
He's a mess.

181
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,583
Ruby!

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,499
What are you doing here?

183
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,666
I was just in the
neighborhood for work.

184
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,499
Haven't they fired you?

185
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,666
Lovely place you got.

186
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,708
Is David here?

187
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,999
He is at his girlfriend's.

188
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,124
- Margaret.
- Marjorie, Brian!

189
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,208
And he is studying for
his finals tomorrow.

190
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,166
- He drop in to see me yesterday.
- I heard.

191
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,499
He wanted to get an own flat.
I was thinking...

192
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,166
Since when you have been more
interest David than your cock?

193
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,374
Ever since he started
have a cute girlfriend.

194
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,709
Look...

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,833
I thought maybe we
can go 50/50 on it?

196
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,041
Fuck you. Why don't you start paying
me your chance-support by your own?

197
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,930
I am broke. Your dentist is rich and
famous, he can help you as well.

198
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,999
Rick is not going
pay for your son!

199
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,874
Just tell him the price
for bunting you!

200
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,083
Can't we just talk normally?

201
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,708
You are not normal.

202
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,166
I can change.

203
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,334
You?

204
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:22,333
- It that your car down there?
- Baby!

205
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,374
Me, Brian.

206
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,666
The famous Brian.

207
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,208
You want coming for a drink?

208
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,916
Have a lucky day.

209
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,042
I am sorry.

210
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,749
It's alright

211
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,499
I'm late.

212
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,041
So you remembered!

213
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,833
- Blond.
- I reserve a lot of lovely fantasies anymore!

214
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,208
Turn around.

215
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:38,874
Please kindly save your trip to the
emergency room before bed time!

216
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,166
All those boys are so violent!

217
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:47,458
Next time Brian can bring one
of his lady friends around.

218
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,708
What about Ali? When we
can meet his girlfriend?

219
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,374
I do not know.

220
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,999
- He called me a mess?
- And what did you say?

221
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,041
I lied. I said that you
are not total fork up.

222
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,916
Kruger is right.

223
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,499
I am a mess.

224
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,208
- Lot's of Kruger's want to talk.
- Don't start again, Claire.

225
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,874
Must remind you unit C10?

226
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:11,499
There, during the apartheid.

227
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,541
It was Kruger who
promote me to captain.

228
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,749
That's wonderful. But how many Black
man he killed and tortured Vlakplaas?

229
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,499
Do not tell me he was
one of those bastards.

230
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,624
We decided that we will

231
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,708
go to live together.

232
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,624
The past is the past.

233
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:29,833
So can we play cards?

234
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,499
Kruger was amnestied.

235
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,166
Of course he is amnestied! Kruger and
all the other murders amnestied!

236
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,416
It's so easy that you pay before
misguide Force of Commission,

237
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,198
You confessed all the
evil degent And presto,

238
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,850
bang, all was forgiven.
Just like that...

239
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,333
Instantly. Absolution
is pendently absurd!

240
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,999
A slage exaggeration,
don't you think?

241
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,416
We were too easy
among us to breaks.

242
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,874
They got we key,

243
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,624
Free as fucking birds.

244
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,541
Prosper than ever as if
nothing had happened.

245
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:02,374
Would you have preferred?
Retribution?

246
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:03,874
More death?

247
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,374
Not retribution, Ali.

248
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,750
Justice.

249
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,083
I would prefer justice.

250
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,208
Claire, If there's
one at the table.

251
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,499
Who possibly want to
take revenge? Is Ali.

252
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,166
But it turns out he's...

253
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,833
Strength and intelligence.

254
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,499
To forgive!

255
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,041
"If you want to make peace
With your enemies,."

256
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:26,124
" Working with your enemies."

257
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,208
" Then they become
your partners ..."

258
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,999
Mandela.

259
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:32,666
So.

260
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,041
Are you hiding the cards?

261
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,416
We are hiding the cards.

262
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,791
And the girls?

263
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:40,416
- No even one last beer.
- I got my in my car.

264
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,416
And your car keep
your slitch's wait.

265
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,416
Blonde? Brown? Or both?

266
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,499
I will tell you that tomorrow.

267
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:52,499
List of the expense judge to Nicole
Weitz credit card over of the past.

268
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,499
Petrol, restaurants, clothes...

269
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,667
Nightclub.

270
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,708
I am Captain Ali Sokhela.

271
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,166
Have you ever seen this girl?

272
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,270
That's the girl who
was killed, right?

273
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,999
Yeah, I saw her on
the newspapers, yes.

274
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,041
That girl was found of
a botanical gardens?

275
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,624
She came several times. She
was here the night she dead.

276
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,291
What did I tell you!
I saw her.

277
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,041
I Knew is her.

278
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,874
She was talking to Zina.

279
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,124
- Zina.
- The girl on the show.

280
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:23,833
Zina?

281
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,166
Captain Ali Sokhela.

282
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,458
I'm a Serious of
violent crimes Unit.

283
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:32,624
Oh, there.

284
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,041
Do you recognize her?

285
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,499
You have seen?

286
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,749
I didn't smash her head in, if
that you would have to ask.

287
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,833
They saw you talking to her.

288
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,749
So what were you talking about?

289
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,124
- I'll wait outside.
- Last Wednesday.

290
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,374
She came up to me after
the performance.

291
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,666
We had a drink together.

292
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,333
Was she alone?

293
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,624
She came alone.

294
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,083
She didn't leave alone.

295
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,999
I spent the night with her.

296
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,166
These overprotected kids.

297
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,874
One day or another,

298
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,499
they want to
experiment new things.

299
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,874
And you?

300
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,249
What are you looking for?

301
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,208
- Me.
- Yes.

302
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,999
I like man.

303
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,666
Around 40,

304
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,874
Prefer being black.

305
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:43,416
But I won't say no to little
treat, from time to time.

306
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,666
Was she in her normal
state, that night?

307
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,833
What do you call " Normal state"

308
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,708
when we making love?

309
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:00,249
We found drugs,
Tik in her blood.

310
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,833
Were you doing that for her?

311
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,624
That night was clean.

312
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,708
All she had was Loving
potion I had made for her,

313
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,291
From the plants. Iboga.

314
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,083
Do you like to try?

315
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,416
In another life, perhaps.

316
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,583
Nicole came to see me again.

317
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,333
She came to see me at the
club again Last Friday night.

318
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,874
Night of her death.

319
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,583
She wanted to buy Loving
potion I made for her.

320
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,916
She wants to party
with some guy.

321
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,624
I recognized the little drugs

322
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,583
and his name is Stan.

323
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,124
Stan...

324
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,833
That's all I know.

325
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,708
Thank you.

326
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,749
Why don't you sleep over?

327
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,791
Because I do not sleep.

328
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,833
Good night.

329
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,334
Go!

330
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:31,792
Brian!

Fast!

422
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,208
Little sister? This is Stan.

423
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,375
Stan?

424
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,999
Sorry, Father, I will come.

425
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,374
Stan? What do you do?

426
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,541
If one seeks me say you
do not know where I am.

427
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,791
- But...
- Shouldn't I stay.

428
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,333
What do I do with the other?

429
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,624
For now, do not worry about it.

430
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,374
Make as usual. Pigs.

431
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,291
They will pay you. Ok! Bye.

432
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,100
Where think you are going?

433
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,541
Cat wants to see you.

434
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,041
The guys of the beach...

435
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:49,874
They not just drug,
Thugs break.

436
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,749
They have bring new weapons,

437
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,249
walk-talkies, night
vision goggles.

438
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:58,083
They were organized. As if they
were protecting something.

439
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,916
We found this at the beach yard.

441
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:56,833
Get out of me!

442
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,124
Don't touch me.

443
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,833
It's getting worse and worse.

444
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:17,333
Cat and his gang control in
this area for 2-3 years ago

445
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,499
I doubt if anyone Deal at Muizenberg
beach, without knowing about it.

446
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,541
It's been a while not see.

A friendly discussion.

451
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,041
I told you he is not here.

452
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,208

Speaking.

465
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,125
A new gang

466
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,083
on the Muizenberg beach.

467
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,416
With a new products.
A rubbish.

468
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,833
A kind of tik.

469
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,916
I am looking for a
boy named Stan.

470
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,374
Do not know Stan. We
do not sell Tick.

471
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,583
- One of my people was killed.
- I know nothing.

472
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,791
Do you recognize this one?

473
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,541
Never seen that ugly mug.

474
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:14,416
This one?

475
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:15,583
No more.

476
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,041
This one?

477
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,208
Ever notice.

478
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,208
I told your guy
control the area.

479
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,174
He tells me that the
people in your territory

480
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,815
dealing drug, and you
know nothing of it.

481
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,624
And you, you realize anything?

482
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,583
Seems you know more than I know.

483
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:38,124
I hope that you
told me the truth.

484
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,499
Hey, how's going?

485
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,583
This is the same drug Nicole Weitz
took the night of her death.

486
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,624
It's exactly the same synthetic
methamphetamine cocktail

487
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,335
but when I did further
analysis I discovered

488
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,524

unknown molecule.

489
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,583
With an unknown molecule.

490
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,374
You mean

491
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,374
you do not know all of
the molecule exists?

492
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,499
You can't imagine what's
been invented to new ()LSD.

493
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,791
From... companies are falling along
with themselves just to searching

494
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,708
new molecules that
affects the brain.

495
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,458
For resistance to
fear, pain, fatigue,

496
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,666
suppression traumatic
memories...

497
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,041
I'll buy it.

498
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:29,333
Those rat inhaled drug
in a short while ago.

499
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,208
Basically after flash
last about 2 to3 minutes,

500
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,499
couples and hierarchical social

501
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,333
go down the drain.

502
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,499
Phase 2 is not quite as pretty.

503
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,125
Apathy,

504
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,708
Loss of sensory bearings,

505
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,166
Antisocial Even
paranoid behavior.

506
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:47,333
Now look what happens
when increased dosage.

507
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,874
Hysteria, extremely aggressive.

508
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:55,666
Suicide in past for some.

509
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,999
And when human being take this
shit? The kind of reactions...

510
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,667
Same thing.

511
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,499
All depends the
dose administered.

512
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,374
What about Nicole Weitz?

513
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,083
Considerately might she took,

514
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,708
God only knows...

515
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,583
You know not hold
your man, chatting.

516
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,624
Cam, I said: Only the
kids in the townships.

517
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,291
This son of a bitch Stan
I think he can cut.

518
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:39,249
Welcome to you.

519
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,458
Hi Rasta.

520
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,999
Stan, you can not spend
your life afraid.

521
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,499
You see my friend here?
Repeat them all.

522
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,499
Everything you told me. All!

523
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,833
Police on a beach

524
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,583
what they want?

525
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,374
What? I can not hear.

526
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,833
For me.

527
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,458
As the cam?

528
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,541
Girls.

529
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,166
What girl?

530
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,458
White . The daughter of rugby.

531
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,833
That one botanical gardens?
You know her?

532
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:30,166
I have been selling cam.
We slept together.

533
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,999
Why did you kill her, stupid?

534
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,499
- At night, she farted a Lead.
- You have to take her tick?

535
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:38,083
Too...

536
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,374
She was too busy.

537
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,791
She wanted to get high.

538
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,916
We started kissing

539
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:47,874
but she started to hit me.

540
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:51,416
She scratched me. Really crazy!

541
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,249
She crushed my balls.

542
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,541
I freaked out.

543
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,999
Who is it?

544
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,708
Men who pay you.

545
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,749
Do not worry about it.

546
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,774
Must clean the house
from the beach.

547
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,660
And other children's bitch?

548
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,749
Keep it cool. It can
still serve us.

549
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,291
I was not expecting you.

550
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,249
This was the last time.

551
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,041
I will not come back, Maia.

552
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,916
What did I do wrong?

553
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,833
We have an agreement.
Now you are free.

554
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,083
I do not want to be free.

555
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,624
Do not worry.

556
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,249
I will continue to help you.

557
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,208
You found someone else?

558
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:40,916
Stop it.

559
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,583
You have. You meet
someone else!

560
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,999
A real woman? What
she has I don't?

561
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,499
- Stop.
- Tell me!

562
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,874
- Stop it.
- You fuck her?

563
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:53,249
- Do you already fucked her.
- Shut up!

564
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,458
He got where it hurts!

565
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,416
You will not become a man,

566
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,542
Small Zulu!

567
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,875
Listening to you!

568
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,541
There you are.

569
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,874
You're almost on time.

570
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:45,583
Kruger isn't here?

571
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,583
Claire doesn't want anyone
from the department here.

572
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,249
Did you tell Kruger I was
slow dancing with some chick

573
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,916
when you guys were
getting chopped up?

574
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,541
I was in charge of
this operation.

575
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,083
I am the one that agreed to
let Dan investigated with us,

576
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,458
not you.

577
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,624
Do not play the boss with me.

578
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:15,166
We'll see it.

579
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:17,499
Here she is . She is here.

580
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,749
Come on, boys.

581
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,116
Stay with Chloe for a little
while, I'll be right there.

582
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,167
Claire...

583
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:41,708
I wish to thank you both for the
support you gave us when I fell ill.

584
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,583
And anything you did
for Dan at that time.

585
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:46,999
But I do not want help
from you anymore.

586
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,624
Of any sort. Do you understand?

587
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:54,749
And I do not want you to
attend cremation ceremony.

588
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:55,917
I know.

589
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:57,999
You're sorry.

590
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,249
She needs time.

591
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,249
Something isn't easy to forgive.

592
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:10,833
Yes, well...

593
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:13,583
Let's hope she's not as...

594
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:15,541
breaky as you are.

595
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Hi, Janet.

596
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:29,249
Dan's wife doesn't want
anyone from the department.

597
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,083
I can stay for a while, anyhow.

598
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,833
Do not worry, I will
give my distance.

599
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,999
As you like. I am going.

600
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,208
Captain!

601
00:44:43,334 --> 00:44:46,333
I took the liberty of checking out
a few things on the Internet.

602
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,208
For around the hut
with where Dan was.

603
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:52,291
There is nothing except one isolated
house about a half km away.

604
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,583
I tried to find out who
lives there. No one.

605
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,499
The house was sold 8 months ago. The said
agency attends presale never saw the owner.

606
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,833
The entire action
shore cooperation.

607
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:06,666
And money was transferred from
offshore accounts in Cayman Islands.

608
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,041
If you want, I can try to
find those behind this.

609
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,249
Good work. Thank you very much.

610
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,208
How would you like
to join my team?

611
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:23,499
Congratulations, Jane.

612
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:25,624
I hope you don't mind that.

613
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,541
Someday an insomniac Zulu
calling you announced

614
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,541
dispense justice remuneration.

615
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:49,916
Did you lose something?

616
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,166
Let's just say I am looking.

617
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,499
For what?

618
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,624
I knew that I would be looking.

619
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:01,541
- You come riding around very often.
- Every morning.

620
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:03,084
Isn't it?

621
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,666
You know who lives here?

622
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,791
You've seen anyone around?

623
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,833
So are you a policeman?

624
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,749
Depends who's asking.

625
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,291
I saw a 4x4 once.

626
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:18,374
- When.
- About ten days ago.

627
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
What kind?

628
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,749
The big kind, dark.

629
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,499
If I show you pictures would
you recognize the model?

630
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,166
We can always try.

631
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:30,291
4 o'clock this afternoon,
policical Hall.

632
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,166
Detective Brian Epkeen...

633
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:33,874
It is an order?

634
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,791
An invitation.

635
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:37,916
Ok, then I will be there.

636
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:56,499
Fucking bird.

637
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:05,083
Good morning.

638
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,125
Do you remember me?

639
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:14,458
I am looking for kids
They fight another day.

640
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:16,874
Do you have an idea
where they can be?

641
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:19,749
- Thanks.
- Sir...

642
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,083
The kid was getting inside...

643
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,208
Never came out.

644
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,583
- Thanks.
- Nothing.

645
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,291
No. It is a big thing,

646
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:28,624
high on the leggy

647
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,208
very ugly.

648
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:34,584
That's it.

649
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:36,225
Are you sure?

650
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,416
I have good eyes.

651
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,499
- What color.
- Green.

652
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:41,334
The 4x4.

653
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,333
Oh, Black.

654
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,041
- Anything else.
- No. It's too far away.

655
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:48,166
Sorry, I have to run.

656
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:50,583
But you will be available
if we need you?

657
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,142
Of course.

658
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,416
How about tonight?

659
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:08,583
That's it. I saw this
child several times.

660
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,208
It's horrible...

661
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:11,541
12 years old!

662
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,916
- Suicide? Are you sure?
- We think it's possible side effect.

663
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,708
Some new drugs certainly
near the area.

664
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:20,970
But the last time I saw him I didn't
make a note that he was on drugs.

665
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,749
What I learn to him, he was
with another kid at his age.

666
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:27,791
Simon belong to a gang out street
kids all hang out in gang stage.

667
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,041
You had medical files
for the reserve?

668
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,249
Sure, but haven't seen them
in a while. As they vanished.

669
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,499
- You told the police?
- What?

670
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,041
The lost kids.

671
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:40,499
We must tell them!

672
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:44,999
Pardon, but the police couldn't
care less about street kids.

673
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,166
And I am been kind
of saying that.

674
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:50,833
And this is another kid there.

675
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,041
You look awful!

676
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:38,916
Try to sleep, Ali.

677
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:42,291
Those kids are disappearing
I'm looking into myself.

678
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:44,791
Oh, that's right, my son.

679
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,833
If your girlfriends happen
to see one of them...

680
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,416
- Ok.
- I am not ask to mention it to people.

681
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,583
Not finding any municipality.

682
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,749
Do not run, Mom.

683
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,309
Agree?

684
00:51:57,334 --> 00:52:01,041
Why you just say it in my
face that I am sick and old.

685
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,291
Mama...

686
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,249
You're sick and you're old.

687
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:16,749
Epkeen...

688
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,333
It's not appear Afrikaans' name.

689
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,708
Yeah, Nah.

690
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:24,541
My father was...

691
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,458
State prosecutor
during apartheid.

692
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,833
Member of the National's Party.

693
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,625
Religions, you know.

694
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,374
Pure and hard.

695
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:39,874
So, I took my Mama's name
when I've turned 17.

696
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,124
How many you want?

697
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
- Three.
- Three?

698
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,916
You make me hungry.

699
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:38,999
- Was a good trip.
- No. Miserable.

700
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:43,333
Five hours later in Airport
Zurich is under snow.

701
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:47,791
But it was worth it. They
are very interested.

702
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,041
- How?
- 40.

703
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,541
For Health.

704
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:57,041
When the trunk will
be in Zurich...

705
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:00,874
We must act quickly. One
police found a house.

706
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:02,624
You have it all cleaned up?

707
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:03,792
Yes.

708
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,666
In 2 or 3 days, everything
will be finished.

709
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,624
In the meantime, we
will give police hull.

710
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,916
Shit.

711
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,499
Sleep well?

712
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:34,499
I have to run.

713
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,333
I completely forgot it's my turn
to drop the kids to nurses.

714
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,141
- Kids? I don't think you have kids.
- I don't . My boyfriend does.

715
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,624
Hey! I'm waiting there!

716
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:59,166
I'm here.

717
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:03,833
I know, I know, bullshit.

718
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,249
Kate Montgomery. A jogger,
found her this morning

719
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:08,999
6: 30.

720
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:10,475
She lives up here,

721
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,833
In the houses with
her father, Tony.

722
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,042
Tony Montgomery...

723
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,225
A singer?

724
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,124
Yes. We havn't been
able to look it in yet.

725
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:19,708
Another student?

726
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,583
No, costumes system
in the movies.

727
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,833
You couldn't introduce me
to a girl live for change?

728
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:26,882
What do we have here?

729
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:29,249
At first glance, looks like
might have some procedure

730
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,541
same as Nicole Weitz, but...

731
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:34,874
She put on fight.

732
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:36,416
It leaves him no chance.

733
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,666
I want the DNA result today.

734
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,791
Do my best.

735
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,999
But, still something new...

736
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,208
B... Z... K...

737
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:48,999
" Bazokhala ."

738
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,541
" Bazokhala "?

739
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:51,999
Zulu war cry.

740
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,499
This means that...

741
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,708
" We will make them cry."

742
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,708
I told her was proof.

743
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,416
Did she running on the
beach every morning?

744
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:04,124
She is a...

745
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:08,541
She was a healthy fleetly girl,

746
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:10,458
Perfect normal.

747
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:13,249
Nicole Weitz's father said too.

748
00:56:14,292 --> 00:56:15,708
Think it could be
the same killer.

749
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:33,083
Hey, this is David.
I was not in.

750
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,666
At 99.9 % match the DNA hair
found on the victim's hand.

751
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,499
Stan Kwalana, 32 years old.

752
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,624
Drug dealing,
robbery, voilence...

753
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:55,850
Zulu?

754
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:58,041
It says that he's colored.

755
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,249
But his certainly had
name is Zuluish.

756
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,874
Dad must be Zulu, his mother
colored. But... I am just guessing.

757
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:18,499
Are you... into my terms
of by for that me now.

758
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,458
Let me guess you happen
to be in this area?

759
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,999
I am in charge of investigating
Kate Montgomery's death.

760
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,416
She recently worked as a
star on video apparently.

761
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,291
On where you came up
production assistant.

762
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:30,624
Three months ago, and...

763
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,374
I am trying to piece together
of her personality perform.

764
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
It's bullshit.

765
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:38,249
- And I am the one you come see.
- Her death doesn't seem to bother you.

766
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:39,916
I barely knew the girl.

767
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,499
Ruby,

768
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,333
Did you answer my questions?

769
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,874
Go ahead, detective.

770
00:57:45,084 --> 00:57:46,916
When did you see Kate
for the last time?

771
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,708
That's enough, Brian, this
is really ridiculous.

772
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,083
To the best of your acknowledge.
Was she taking drugs?

773
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,999
How on earth could I know?

774
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:56,166
Drugs and showbiz are exactly
all together, isn't it?

775
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:58,541
- I do not work in showbiz.
- No.

776
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,249
But what do dentist with stars,

777
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:02,737
you should be invisted to
center lating dinner parties,

778
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,166
with DV news readers, Top
models... I do not know.

779
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,166
You're not getting
any better with age.

780
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,666
Someone who claimed
they hated vulgarity...

781
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,124
Did David pass his exam?

782
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:20,124
- Call him and you will find out.
- He won't answer my calls.

783
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,083
Top of his class, Brian.

784
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:28,166
And learn look approud of inspect
whatever, Not thanks to you.

785
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:32,458
Is there anything else you can tell
me about Kate Montgomery, Miss?

786
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:34,874
" Mrs.".

787
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:37,124
Rick and I are getting married.

788
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,833
And here.

789
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,999
You never learnt, ehm?

790
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:45,583
Still g hunting
guys fuck around.

791
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,916
The screw over to you.

792
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,249
Fuck you!

793
00:58:51,584 --> 00:58:53,458
Who do you think you are?
Asshole.

794
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:54,584
Hi, Ricky boy.

795
00:58:58,209 --> 00:58:59,209
You bastard!

796
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:01,833
Have a larkish swim!

797
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:10,708
Where are you?

798
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:11,875
Nowhere special.

799
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,166
- Why.
- Someone send us a present.

800
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,249
- You need me.
- Yes!

801
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,499
Found in the trash
containers of the.

802
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:19,999
Police Station.

803
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,499
Well, we found Stan.

804
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:28,583
Claw marks.

805
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,749
Don't you think it's
too good to be true?

806
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,999
This head which leads
us on the tray...

807
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,624
Stan is illiterate.

808
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,249
He couldn't even
write his own name.

809
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,499
And he's get kids writing
on young girls' corpses?

810
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,999
I don't think so.

811
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,208
You can not...

812
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,083
Quiet!

813
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,999
You don't like my gift?

814
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,874
I hear about your
friend on beach.

815
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:14,083
Do not tell me you
know how to read.

816
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,666
I got girls read for me...

817
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,083
- Do you know something about literature?
- I have the Holy Bible on my ass.

818
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,416
Where you found?

819
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,333
These bastards, catch them all.

820
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,124
Any other, where are they?

821
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:56,209
On the other way!

822
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:03,083
Are you alright?

823
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,124
Move, move!

824
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,541
Move out the way!

825
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,541
He's fine.

826
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:22,541
Is he? Where is he?

827
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,833
The man who kill Nicole
Weitz and Kate Montgomery

828
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:49,166
has been positively
identified by DNA.

829
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:53,291
Stan Kwalana was a known drug
dealer as far as we know

830
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:56,874
did not belong to any extremist
political organization

831
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:59,083
I wish to stress the fact.

832
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,999
That our police force
did a remarkable job.

833
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,916
Couple of days rest
of me, on it's feet.

834
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,583
Did you find anything?

835
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,624
There're only two 4x4s at
this type in the area.

836
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,541
One belongs to a 77 year
old man who only takes as

837
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:19,249
a good art.

838
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:22,458
And the other, belongs to a
private security company,

839
01:03:22,584 --> 01:03:23,624
DPS.

840
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:27,255
- Epkeen, come with me. I want to talk
to you - As soon as I finished it.

841
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:31,749
Did you verify whether the company has a
home security contract for the beach house?

842
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:34,708
Did you heard the
investigation is over?

843
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:37,999
- Doesn't the body you kill was illiterate.
- Should he?

844
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,041
How could Stan written
" bazokhala "?

845
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:45,333
The girl has his hair in her
hand, and we have the DNA.

846
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,541
Set up.

847
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:50,458
Won't you have be that for
once you did a good job?

848
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:54,979
Is the company has a home contract
surveillance for beach home?

849
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,291
I forbid you answer that!

850
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,833
Rick Van Der Verkuizen wait a
pleasing file charges against you.

851
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:03,083
So We're waiting for you to appear
in court, I am suspending you.

852
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,666
Sehingga anda menghabiskan di hadapan
hakim, saya menggantung anda.

853
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:09,291
In other words, get out! Now!

854
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,874
You're a shit, Kruger.

855
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,458
An ass the Fucking
piece of shit!

856
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:18,499
Fuck you, Epkeen!

857
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,999
Fuck you!

858
01:04:45,084 --> 01:04:46,124
Hi!

859
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:48,583
What the holly you doing here?

860
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,125
Marjorie?

861
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:52,833
Brian. Father of...

862
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:54,208
Good evening, sir.

863
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:55,708
How did you find where I was?

864
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:59,541
I am a cop. I heard
about your exams.

865
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:01,583
I wanna take you congratulate.

866
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,249
- And you get a celebrate?
- I hope so!

867
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,833
I am going to wait you inside.

868
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:11,416
Bye, sir.

869
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:19,083
Good manners, eh?
She seems nice.

870
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,291
Mom said you came
around ass her.

871
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,499
You are jealous, isn't that?

872
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,749
Of what?

873
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:28,624
Sleeping with the dention-King?

874
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:31,499
I do not think so.

875
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,416
You leave mama alone.

876
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:35,749
You've done enough hurt of this.

877
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,833
For the deposit on your flat,

878
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,999
and for being a shit Dad.

879
01:06:26,334 --> 01:06:27,334
Detective...

880
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:29,334
Detective!

881
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:35,874
Sorry.

882
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:39,124
Hi, Jane.

883
01:06:40,084 --> 01:06:42,083
I checked for the
security company.

884
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,690
You know, DPS, the
security company?

885
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,249
Woo, woo Wait a second.

886
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,666
Look, I am listening.

887
01:06:54,834 --> 01:06:55,874
DPS

888
01:06:56,084 --> 01:06:57,499
The security company,

889
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,999
Officially, there is no
contract for the beach house.

890
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:04,041
But I took liberty of hacking
DPS's computer systems.

891
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:05,624
Over the past 6 months.

892
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:07,791
The offshore companies
that own the house.

893
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,416
Paid of three million
rand to DPS!

894
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:12,542
Shit...

895
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:15,458
enough monitor and
drugs in the houses.

896
01:07:15,584 --> 01:07:17,666
In the DPS's cunstom files.

897
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,499
It is South African
cellphone number

898
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,624
that listed full of
the offshore company.

899
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:25,166
Dr Joost Opperman. It's the
cellphone number belongs to him.

900
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,166
- What kind of doctor.
- A geeky researcher.

901
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,791
A genius molecular
chemistry founder creak.

902
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:32,999
Opperman.

903
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,999
Type " Opperman, Project Coast..."

904
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:42,917
That's it.

905
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:46,458
The Bastards who are
part of Beach project.

906
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,791
You haven't heard about it?

907
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,624
You are too young.

908
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:53,583
A nut.

909
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,083
A secret project. Scientists and
medical officers by the regime

910
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,166
to develop chemical weapons
virus, this kind of shit.

911
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:03,041
Anything can come up prevent
blacks increase any number.

912
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:04,749
Dr Opperman.

913
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:07,249
Testify before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commision.

914
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,541
Of course.

915
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,208
Government gave us carte blanch.

916
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,333
We have 200 scientists.

917
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,708
Our mission is to develop
might calling...

918
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,624
ethnic bomb.

919
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:20,874
Could you be more specific?

920
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:23,333
A chemical weapons.

921
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:27,416
A molecule capable to desolating
the black population.

922
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,791
But I was following the Chain of
command by orders from my top.

923
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,916
Not my place to question them.

924
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,458
These girls

925
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:39,499
is.

926
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:42,124
Just the tip of the iceberg.

927
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,999
Opperman has developed molecules
that makes people go crazy

928
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:47,791
and was stashed in dark.

929
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:53,166
He use Cat's gang to dumped it off
from streets in the town shop?

930
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:56,791
That would explain why
Kids are disappearing.

931
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,374
They must kill each
other or themselves.

932
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,041
And the youth you
find in the pipe.

933
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,583
Yeah, but what about
Nicole Weitz?

934
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:08,999
Probably not part of the plan.

935
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:13,083
The beach house was their
lab, Stan was watching over.

936
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,930
He must has taken
advantage of the seller.

937
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,333
In most of the bright ideas to sell
tick to white kids on the side.

938
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,499
Where is this Dr. Opperman?

939
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:22,666
He left the country after
remit by the commission.

940
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:24,583
It's like he
vanishes in the air.

941
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,916
If you like, I can try to
track his bank account.

942
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,333
My friend Kruger's
lock the same.

943
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,874
As well, we will not
go to tell him.

944
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:35,499
Didn't you have an
operation last night?

945
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,666
Go and check out the
security company.

946
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,291
What the fuck you doing?

947
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:42,291
I am going to see Cat.

948
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,249
We leave tonight.

949
01:10:10,209 --> 01:10:12,833
I need you clean everything.

950
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:17,749
And do not forget
the girl for pigs.

951
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:27,749
Fucking psychopath.

952
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,350
Mom?

953
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,874
Hello, Ali, are you alright?

954
01:11:28,475 --> 01:11:29,475
Are you feeling better?

955
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,291
Do not worry, I am a true Zulu.

956
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:32,499
What's that noise?

957
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,499
They just open the
window of my room.

958
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,499
- You must be careful of...
- Draft.

959
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:40,392
Yes.

960
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:41,541
I know.

961
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:43,499
You know, one of my
friend Mahimbo...

962
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:47,499
She thinks she saw one of
your kids, about a week ago.

963
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:49,392
Where?

964
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:51,249
Near the Lengezi church.

965
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:54,166
There is a girl there
the minist of priests,

966
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:57,666
holding the soup kitchen for
the poor in this neighborhood.

967
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,416
She's been in contact
with these kids.

968
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,541
Does not make you tired, Mom.

969
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:06,874
Do not forget that
I also a Zulu.

970
01:12:07,084 --> 01:12:08,708
As much as you!

971
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,124
I know.

972
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,416
I know.

973
01:12:43,517 --> 01:12:44,517
Yes, Janet.

974
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,823
Guess who is in charge of the
logistics of Project Coast?

975
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,833
The young officer,
name Frank Debeer.

976
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:51,916
Who is now the owner
of DPS Company.

977
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,499
Looking for something?

978
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,874
Hello, Brian? Can you hear me?

979
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,541
Thank you, Janet.

980
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,166
Is this vehicle yours?

981
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:06,708
Belongs the company.

982
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:11,708
Are you the owner, Mr...?

983
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:13,999
Debeer. Yes, I am. Why?

984
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,416
Do you use it often?

985
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:18,666
Use for around! I asked you why!

986
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:22,166
I am asking you. To
change of tone of voice.

987
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:26,249
This is a security agency not
a tourist information centre.

988
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,833
I am investigating

01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,499
I spoke to Janet.

1150
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:12,083
Can I take a look?

1151
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,583
We got everything
to lock them up.

1152
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:24,083
Opperman, the lab...

1153
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,541
Ali! Are you listening to me?

1154
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,624
It won't bring them back.

1155
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,791
Your mother, Dan, and
all the others...

1156
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,166
It won't bring them back.

1157
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:34,625
Fucker, do you hear me?

1158
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:37,749
Not this way.

1159
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:39,041
Not you.

1160
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:42,208
Don't you dare give me lessons!

1161
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,208
I know this shit by heart.

1162
01:32:44,584 --> 01:32:46,999
I've been recited for 40 years!

1163
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,166
Brian, Let go my weapon.

1164
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:54,249
- Loose.
- Not this way.

1165
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:55,874
Loose!

1166
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:11,815
What are you doing
here, you dirt...

1167
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,333
Mister Ali, you're not
going to shoot me?

1168
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:10,249
Motherfucker, there is the
other white. He is the devil.

1169
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:27,249
Please not do that.

1170
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,500
Just saying...

1171
01:35:30,334 --> 01:35:31,666
I made a copy.

1172
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,333
Please...

1173
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:13,541
Forgive me, please.

1174
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,583
I see something, Two o'clock.

1175
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:46,792
Thanks.

1176
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,416
If I take a second stand
and grave as well.

1177
01:41:57,542 --> 01:41:58,583
Someone else died?

1178
01:42:02,459 --> 01:42:03,708
A few years ago.

1179
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:08,291
It's taken me a
while to arouded.
