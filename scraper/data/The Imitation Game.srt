1
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,310
<i>Are you paying attention?</i>

2
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,843
<i>Good.</i>

3
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,786
<i>If you're not listening carefully,
you will miss things,</i>

4
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,289
<i>important things.</i>

5
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:58,436
<i>I will not pause. I will not repeat myself,
and you will not interrupt me.</i>

6
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:04,768
<i>You think that because you are sitting
where you are and I am sitting where I am</i>

7
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:07,838
<i>that you are in control
of what is about to happen.</i>

8
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,543
<i>You're mistaken. I am in control.</i>

9
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:17,983
<i>Because I know things
that you do not know.</i>

10
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,921
Manchester Police Department,
please hold.

11
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,359
<i>Windows broken. Home's been ransacked.</i>

12
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,194
<i>Send a detective down, will you?</i>

13
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:36,033
<i>What I will need from you now
is a commitment.</i>

14
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:41,505
<i>You will listen closely, and you
will not judge me until I am finished.</i>

15
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:45,042
<i>If you cannot commit to this,
then please leave the room.</i>

16
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:46,776
Come in.

17
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,772
<i>But if you choose to stay,
remember you chose to be here.</i>

18
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:55,473
<i>What happens from this moment forwards
is not my responsibility.</i>

19
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:56,387
<i>It's yours.</i>

20
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,058
<i>Pay attention.</i>

21
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:19,810
- What's all this, then?
- Turing, Alan. Professor at King's.

22
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,846
- Seems there's been a burglary.
- Oh? What of?

23
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,748
Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.

24
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,552
What's he doing in Manchester?

25
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,556
Something with machines.

26
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:40,497
The project at the NPL.

27
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,434
I checked,
but he won't say what it's on.

28
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:49,306
Professor Turing?
Detective Nock, Manchester Police.

29
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,152
Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.

30
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:58,682
Professor Turing?

31
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,719
Take a step back,
and don't breath heavily.

32
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,288
- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.

33
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:09,426
It wouldn't take more
than a thimbleful to kill you.

34
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,865
- Disappointing.
- Pardon?

35
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,001
I had hoped for a bit more.

36
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,471
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me, or do you
get the sense that we're being insulted?

37
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,557
Last night, you had a break-in.

38
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,342
Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,
called to report the noise.

39
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:29,646
He said there was quite a ruckus.
Only you say nothing was taken.

40
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:32,228
It's odd. So, how about you
tell us what happened,

41
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:34,194
and we'll find the chap who did this.

42
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:38,388
Gentlemen, I don't believe that
you could find the chap that did this

43
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:41,524
if he walked up to you
and spat in your face.

44
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:45,896
What I could us right now is not
a bobby, but a really good cleaning lady.

45
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,757
So, unless one of you
has an apron in your car,

46
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:52,239
I suggest you file your reports
and leave me alone.

47
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,374
As you say, Professor Turing.

48
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,546
Best of luck with your cyanide.

49
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,016
I'll give you a quid if you can
name me a more insufferable sod.

50
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:09,619
- Seemed a bit forced, though, didn't it?
- Don't know what you mean.

51
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,462
Well, if you didn't want a pair of bobbies
digging around in your personal affairs,

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,792
that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.

53
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,563
- Tell me you don't think this is suspicious.
- I don't think this is suspicious.

54
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,605
A mysterious professor who won't admit
he's had something stolen from his house?

55
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,516
I think Alan Turing's hiding something.

56
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:41,918
War declared!
800,000 children evacuated!

57
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:44,822
German bombs on their way!
Get your papers here!

58
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,390
Fresh off the press! War declared!

59
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,695
800,000 children evacuated!
German bombs expected soon!

60
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:21,092
<i>This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin</i>

61
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,493
<i>handed the German government</i>

62
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:28,232
<i>a final note stating
that unless we heard from them,</i>

63
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:33,337
<i>by 11:00, a state of war
would exist between us.</i>

64
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:39,176
<i>I have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received.</i>

65
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:44,247
<i>And that, consequently,
this country is at war</i>

66
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:46,250
<i>with Germany.</i>

67
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:16,513
<i>For the second time
in the lives of most of us,</i>

68
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,615
<i>we are...</i>

69
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:20,517
<i>at war.</i>

70
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,920
<i>To find</i>

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,189
<i>a peaceful way out...</i>

72
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,728
Papers, please.

73
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,465
What are you doing here?

74
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:12,769
- Oh, the lady told me to wait.
- In my office?

75
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,752
She tell you to help yourself
to tea while you were here?

76
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,775
No, she didn't.

77
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,712
She obviously didn't tell you
what a joke was, then, either, I gather.

78
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,849
Was she supposed to?

79
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:29,052
- Who are you?
- Alan Turing.

80
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,752
Turing. The mathematician.

81
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,191
- Correct.
- However could I have guessed?

82
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,462
Well, you didn't. You just
read it on that piece of paper.

83
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,131
King's College, Cambridge.

84
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,334
Now, it says here you were a bit of
a prodigy in the maths department.

85
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,337
I'm not sure I can
evaluate that, Mr....

86
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,806
- How old are you, Mr. Turing?
- 27.

87
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,242
And how old were you when you became
a Fellow at Cambridge?

88
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,144
- 24.
- And how old were you...

89
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,547
when you published this paper
that has a title I can barely understand?

90
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,261
23.

91
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,285
And you don't think that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?

92
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,455
Well, Newton discovered
binomial theorem aged 22.

93
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:09,225
Einstein wrote four papers that changed
the world by the age of 26.

94
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:13,196
As far as I can tell, I've...
I've barely made par.

95
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:16,199
- My God, you're serious.
- Would you prefer I made a joke?

96
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,335
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

97
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:21,471
Hardly seems fair that that's a
requirement for employment here, Mr...

98
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,075
Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.
All right, Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

99
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,877
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's government?

100
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,346
Oh, I don't, really.

101
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,449
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

102
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:35,618
I'm... agnostic about violence.

103
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,121
Well, you do realize
that 600 miles away from London

104
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:42,525
there's this nasty little chap called Hitler
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

105
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,929
- Politics isn't really my area of expertise.
- Really?

106
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,833
Well, I believe you've just set the record
for the shortest job interview

107
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,336
in British military history.

108
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,628
Mother says I can be
off-putting sometimes

109
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,273
on account of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

110
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,243
- In the world?
- Oh, yes.

111
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:03,679
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this program?

112
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:04,546
No.

113
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,883
Well, that's right,
because we're a top-secret program.

114
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,019
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

115
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:13,657
that only last week, I rejected one
of our great nation's top linguists.

116
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,959
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.

117
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,829
- I don't speak German.
- What?

118
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,165
I don't... speak German.

119
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:25,169
Well, how the hell were you supposed
to decrypt German communications

120
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,767
if you don't...
I don't know, speak German?

121
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,207
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

122
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,673
Margaret!

123
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:35,678
The German codes are a puzzle.
A game, just like any other game.

124
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:38,281
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games. Puzzles.

125
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:41,017
And this is the most difficult
puzzle in the world.

126
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:44,639
Margaret! For the love of God.

127
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,594
This is a joke, obviously.

128
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:50,427
I'm afraid I don't know what those are,
Commander Denniston.

129
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,029
Have a pleasant trip
back to Cambridge, Professor.

130
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,297
Enigma.

131
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,467
You called for me?

132
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:08,645
That's what you're doing here.
The top-secret program at Bletchley.

133
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,982
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

134
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,551
What makes you think that?

135
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,020
It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

136
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,590
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

137
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,695
If the Allies broke Enigma, well...

138
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:28,383
this would turn
into a very short war, indeed.

139
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:31,159
Of course that's what you're working on.

140
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,199
But you also haven't got
anywhere with it. If you had,

141
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,639
you wouldn't be hiring cryptographers
out of university.

142
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:38,541
You need me a lot more than I need you.

143
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:42,379
I like solving problems, Commander.

144
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,282
And Enigma is the most difficult
problem in the world.

145
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,818
No, Enigma isn't difficult;
it's impossible.

146
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:52,207
The Americans, the Russians,
the French, the Germans,

147
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,658
everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.

148
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:59,515
Good. Let me try,
and we'll know for sure, won't we?

149
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:03,701
Welcome to Enigma.

150
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:08,571
The details of every surprise attack,

151
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,062
every secret convoy

152
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:16,079
and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic
go into that thing.

153
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,349
And out comes gibberish.

154
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,252
It's beautiful.

155
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,321
It's the crooked hand of death itself.

156
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,598
Our Wrens intercept
thousands of radio messages a day,

157
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:35,117
and to the lovely young ladies of the
Women's Royal Navy, they're nonsense.

158
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:38,585
It's only when you feed them back
into Enigma that they make any sense.

159
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,537
But we have an Enigma machine.

160
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:43,239
Yes, Polish Intelligence
smuggled it out of Berlin.

161
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,575
So, what's the problem?
Just put the intercepted messages

162
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:50,113
- back into the Enigma and you'll...
- Look, it's not that simple, is it?

163
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:54,489
Just having an Enigma machine
doesn't help you to decode the messages.

164
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,320
Very good, Mr. Turing.

165
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,232
To decode a message, you need
to know the machine's settings.

166
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:04,694
Now, the Germans switch settings
every day promptly at midnight.

167
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:08,598
We usually intercept our first
message around 6:00 a.m.,

168
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:12,249
which gives you exactly
18 hours every day

169
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:16,614
to crack the code before it changes,
and you start again.

170
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:20,315
Five rotors. Ten plugboard cables.
That's...

171
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,949
- One million...
- A thousand million...

172
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,213
No, no, it's, I've got it.

173
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,515
- It's million, million.
- It's in the millions, obviously.

174
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:28,752
It's over 150 million million
million possible settings.

175
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:30,153
Very good.

176
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,888
159. If you want to be exact about it.

177
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:37,494
1-5-9 with 18 zeroes behind it.

178
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:41,129
Possibilities. Every single day.

179
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:43,733
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

180
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,371
- I personally selected him to run this unit.
- Didn't you...

181
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:50,240
Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

182
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:51,708
Twice.

183
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,849
You're not the only one who's good
at games around here, Turing.

184
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:59,516
Are we to work together, then?
I prefer to have my own office.

185
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,184
You're a team, and you will work as one.

186
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:04,671
I don't have time to explain myself
as I go along, and...

187
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:07,532
I'm afraid these men
would only slow me down.

188
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,994
If you can't play together,
then I'm afraid we can't let you play at all.

189
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,296
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

190
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:18,025
There are only five divisions of
military intelligence. There is no MI6.

191
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,038
Exactly. That's the spirit.

192
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:25,866
Mr. Turing, do you know how many British
servicemen have died because of Enigma?

193
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,311
- No, I don't.
- Three...

194
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,249
while we've been having
this conversation.

195
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:35,952
Oh, look, there's another.

196
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,187
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

197
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,591
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

198
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,126
we're not winning it.

199
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,764
Break the code,
at least we have a chance.

200
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:52,802
Shall we leave the children alone
with their new toy?

201
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,938
All right, gentlemen...

202
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:04,548
Let's play.

203
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,387
<i>The game was quite a simple one.</i>

204
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:16,092
<i>Every single German message,
every surprise attack,</i>

205
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:21,596
<i>every bombing run,
every imminent U-boat assault...</i>

206
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:28,872
<i>They were all floating through the air.</i>

207
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,383
<i>Radio signals that...</i>

208
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:45,521
<i>well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit could intercept.</i>

209
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,694
<i>The trick was that they were encrypted.</i>

210
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:06,776
<i>There were 159 million million
million possible Enigma settings.</i>

211
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:09,946
<i>All we had to do was try each one.</i>

212
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:16,285
<i>But if we had ten men
checking one setting a minute</i>

213
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,989
<i>for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,</i>

214
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,993
<i>how many days do you think
it would take to...</i>

215
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:27,364
<i>to check each of the settings?</i>

216
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,168
<i>Well, it's not days, it's years.</i>

217
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,040
- Good morning.
- <i>It's 20 million years.</i>

218
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,776
- <i>To stop a coming attack...</i>
- Thank you.

219
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:44,914
<i>...we would have to check
20 million years' worth of settings</i>

220
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,121
<i>in 20 minutes.</i>

221
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,813
I'm famished. Lunch?

222
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:20,817
Good Lord.
What is it about women with little hats?

223
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:30,894
The boys, we're going to get some lunch.

224
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,900
- Alan?
- Yes?

225
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,053
I said we're going to get some lunch.

226
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,707
- Alan?
- Yes?

227
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,441
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

228
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,412
I said we're off to get some lu...

229
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,581
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

230
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:52,681
What is?

231
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,684
I had asked if you wanted
to come to lunch with us.

232
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:58,488
No, you didn't. You said
you were going to get some lunch.

233
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:02,058
- Have I offended you in some way?
- Why would you think that?

234
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,563
- Would you like to come to lunch with us?
- What time's lunchtime?

235
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,897
Christ, Alan, it's a bleeding sandwich.

236
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,799
- What is?
- Lunch.

237
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,102
- Oh, I don't like sandwiches.
- Never mind.

238
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:17,706
You know, to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

239
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,742
one actually has to be a genius, Alan.

240
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:22,245
And yet we're the ones
making progress here, aren't we?

241
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:23,672
Oh, you are?

242
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,299
Yes, we are.

243
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,218
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

244
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,255
by analyzing the frequency
of letter distribution.

245
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:34,857
Oh, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

246
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:37,364
That's not progress;
that's just blind luck.

247
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:41,597
I'm designing a machine that will
allow us to break every message

248
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:45,202
every day instantly.

249
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:50,006
Who's hungry? Let's go.

250
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:52,050
I'm hungry.

251
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,410
What?

252
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,647
Peter asked who was hungry.
Can I have some soup, please?

253
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,336
What do you mean, "classified"?

254
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,539
No, I'm aware of the literal meaning
of the word classified.

255
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,358
What I'm asking is why
would a maths professor

256
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,445
have his military records classified?

257
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,949
Yeah, well, I will come down.

258
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:45,823
Sorry, can I get you
to hold for a minute, please?

259
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:01,737
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

260
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:06,045
Service records of a Mr. Turing. Alan.

261
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,345
Foreign Office sent me.

262
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,953
This is unacceptable.

263
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:20,190
If you wish to discuss the complaint,
I suggest you make a proper appointment.

264
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,792
Alexan... Complaint?

265
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:26,229
No, no, Hugh Alexander
has denied my requisition for parts

266
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,702
and equipment that I need to build
the machine I've designed.

267
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:31,134
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you,

268
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:35,037
- and they filed a formal complaint.
- It's is inspired by an old Polish code machine.

269
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:38,641
- Only this one is infinitely more advanced.
- If you don't respond to the complaint,

270
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,810
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

271
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,846
- Put those files by my desk.
- Fine, my response is they're all idiots.

272
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,015
Fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

273
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:48,919
I only need about 100,000 pounds.

274
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,355
100,000...

275
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:54,723
Why are you building a machine?

276
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,027
It's highly technical.
You wouldn't understand.

277
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,830
I suggest you make the effort to try.

278
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:06,068
Enigma is... an extremely
well-designed machine.

279
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:09,104
Our problem is that we're only
using men to try to beat it.

280
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:13,409
No, what if only a machine
can defeat another machine?

281
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:15,011
Well, that's not very technical.

282
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:19,148
Hugh Alexander is in charge of your unit.
He said no, and that is that.

283
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:21,504
I simply don't have time for this.

284
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:24,490
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

285
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,823
I have. Do you know how it's done?

286
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,759
Order, discipline, chain of command.

287
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,395
You're not at university any longer.

288
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:35,765
You are a very small cog
in a very large system.

289
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:39,368
And you will do as your
commanding officer instructs.

290
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:41,549
Yes.

291
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,775
Who is your commanding officer?

292
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:51,046
Winston Churchill, Number 10
Downing Street, London, SW1.

293
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:55,050
You have a problem with my decision,
you can take it up with him.

294
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,648
Mr. Menzies! Mr. Menzies!

295
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:08,798
Are you going to London?

296
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:10,792
Possibly.

297
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,227
Would you deliver a letter for me?

298
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,612
Look, I'm sorry, but are you joking?

299
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:24,980
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

300
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,550
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

301
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,952
So, I can give these men orders now?

302
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,054
I hate to say it, but yes.

303
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:34,124
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

304
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,726
- Excuse me?
- What?

305
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:39,563
You're mediocre linguists,
and positively poor code-breakers.

306
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:42,264
Alan, you can't just fire
Keith and Charles.

307
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,134
- Well, he just said I could.
- No, I did no such thing.

308
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:46,698
But Churchill did.

309
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,848
Go to hell.

310
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:04,971
Well,

311
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:08,593
this is inhuman. Even for you.

312
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,401
Popular at school, were you?

313
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,607
<i>The problem began, of course,
with the carrots.</i>

314
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,342
<i>Carrots are orange.</i>

315
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:30,045
<i>And peas are green.</i>

316
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,808
<i>They mustn't touch.</i>

317
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,478
I got it.

318
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:58,474
<i>Do you know why people like violence?</i>

319
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:02,645
<i>It is because it feels... good.</i>

320
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,383
<i>Humans find violence deeply satisfying.</i>

321
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:12,474
<i>But remove the satisfaction, and...</i>

322
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,956
<i>the act becomes...</i>

323
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,668
<i>hollow.</i>

324
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,800
Turing?

325
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,434
Come on.
Don't be such a kike about it.

326
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:32,042
Leave him to bloody rot.

327
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,250
<i>I didn't learn this
on my own, of course.</i>

328
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,284
<i>I had help.</i>

329
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,809
<i>Christopher helped.</i>

330
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:50,028
Alan, are you all right?

331
00:25:55,664 --> 00:26:00,102
It's not my fault.
The carrots got in with the peas and...

332
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:04,173
- I'm sorry. I won't let them do it again.
- They're getting worse.

333
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:07,175
They only beat me up
because I'm smarter than they are.

334
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,211
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

335
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:13,849
- Mother says I'm just an odd duck.
- And she's right.

336
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:18,721
But you know, Alan, sometimes it's the very
people who no one imagines anything of

337
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:22,057
who do the things no one can imagine.

338
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:30,666
So, what do we do now?

339
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:35,504
- We're short on staff.
- Well, we get more staff then.

340
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,480
And how do you propose to do that?

341
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,493
- Alan Turing to see Stewart Menzies.
- Very good, sir.

342
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,197
- So, who are they?
- Oh, all sorts, really.

343
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,967
Teacher, an engineer,
a handful of students.

344
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:21,837
And you think they're qualified for Bletchley
'cause they're good at crossword puzzles?

345
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:25,741
Well, they say they're good,
and now we shall find out, won't we?

346
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,776
In order to aid your efforts,
there is, to the right of you,

347
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,580
a green scratch card book.
You are to make notes in that.

348
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,396
Gentlemen, you have six minutes
in which to complete the puzzle,

349
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:36,436
at which point, I will...

350
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:41,022
Pardon, ma'am, this room's restricted.

351
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:44,151
Apologies for my tardiness.
The bus caught a flat tire.

352
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:46,473
May I continue, please? Thank you.

353
00:29:46,573 --> 00:29:49,631
- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.
- Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late.

354
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:52,968
The secretaries are to head upstairs.
This room's for the candidates.

355
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,070
May I get on with this now, please?

356
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,500
- I am a candidate.
- For what position?

357
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,677
- The letter didn't say precisely.
- Yeah, so secretaries are to head upstairs.

358
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:05,414
- It did say that it was top secret.
- What is going on?

359
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:08,183
I solved a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper,

360
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:12,087
and I got this letter saying that I was a
candidate for some sort of mysterious job.

361
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:14,022
My name's Joan Clarke.

362
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:18,285
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

363
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:21,563
What makes you think I couldn't
solve the puzzle myself?

364
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:24,106
- I'm really very good at...
- Ma'am, I'll have to ask you to...

365
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:30,617
Miss Clarke, I find tardiness under
any circumstance, unacceptable.

366
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:36,085
Take a seat so that we may continue.

367
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,845
Thank you.

368
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:47,856
Now, as I was saying, you have six minutes
to complete the task in front of you.

369
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:53,136
Gentlemen and lady, begin.

370
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,995
Six minutes.

371
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:27,128
- Is that even possible?
- No, it takes me eight.

372
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:30,165
This isn't about crossword puzzles.
It's about how one

373
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,011
approaches solving
an impossible problem.

374
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:36,873
Do you tackle the whole thing at once
or divide it into small...

375
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:41,194
- You've finished?
- Yes.

376
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,694
- Five minutes and 34 seconds.
- You said to do it in under six.

377
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:05,600
Congratulations. My warmest welcome
to His Majesty's service.

378
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,903
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

379
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,718
you will be executed for high treason.

380
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:15,073
You will lie to your friends,
your family and everyone you meet

381
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:16,846
about what it is you really do.

382
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:21,083
And what is it that we're really doing?

383
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:24,953
We're going to break an unbreakable
Nazi code and win the war.

384
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:39,367
What's that you're reading?

385
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:43,138
- It's about cryptography.
- Like secret messages?

386
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:47,971
Not secret. That's the brilliant part.

387
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:50,712
Messages that anyone can see,
but no one knows what they mean

388
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:53,315
unless you have the key.

389
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,884
How's that different from talking?

390
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:03,425
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

391
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,328
they never say what they mean.
They say something else,

392
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:11,566
and you're expected to just know
what they mean. Only I never do.

393
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:14,971
So, how's that different?

394
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:20,042
Alan, I have a funny feeling
you're going to be very good at this.

395
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,048
Good night, Alan.

396
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:54,210
Good night.

397
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,975
Hold on, Marion, I'm coming!

398
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,525
...lesser settings
and then route back through...

399
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,478
Back to those ones...

400
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:16,064
Careful, will you? It not a toy.

401
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:20,966
Funny. Looks like a toy.
Bloody great 100,000-pound one.

402
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,004
Your new minion's arrived.

403
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,190
- Jack Good. We met...
- Well, where's Miss Clarke?

404
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,745
Lovely, isn't he?

405
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:35,651
It's not just a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

406
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:40,789
I mean, well, as I was saying,
it's a very important radio factory.

407
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,360
It's not, actually.
Well, on the spectrum of radio factories,

408
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,269
this one is particularly...

409
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,209
Why are you not at Bletchley?

410
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,887
Thank you... so much for your visit,
Mr. Turing. Was your trip pleasant?

411
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:06,314
Gather your things and let's go.

412
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:09,297
I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

413
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:13,321
We feel that such a position
would hardly be appropriate.

414
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:15,590
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

415
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,593
But sadly wasn't granted the opportunity
to become a Fellow.

416
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:20,601
You belong at Bletchley.

417
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:25,367
I'm sorry, but for someone
in my position, to live to...

418
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:28,803
to work in a radio factory
so far from home,

419
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:32,990
with all your men... it would be...

420
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,277
indecorous.

421
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:40,105
What in the world does that even mean?

422
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,388
We have a group of young ladies

423
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:50,959
who tend to all of our clerical tasks:
assistants, translators.

424
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,309
They live together in town.

425
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,666
Would that be a more
suitable environment?

426
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:01,737
So, I would be working
amongst these women?

427
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:03,353
Yes.

428
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:11,246
Wonderful ladies. They even organize social
events at St. Martin's Church down the road.

429
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:13,950
Really, the whole thing is quite...

430
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,220
decorous.

431
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:24,595
Now, you won't have proper
security clearance, of course, so,

432
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:28,229
- we'll have to improvise things a bit.
- Why are you helping me?

433
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,642
Because there is only one thing that
matters in this entire world right now.

434
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:33,903
Do you understand?
And that is breaking Enigma.

435
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,365
But, Mr. Turing...

436
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,178
why are you helping me?

437
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:46,014
Sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

438
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:49,470
who do the things
that no one can imagine.

439
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:09,771
Sir.

440
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:14,442
- What's this?
- Alan Turing's classified military file.

441
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:17,312
- It's bloody empty.
- Exactly.

442
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:20,482
- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

443
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:23,518
Well, you've cracked the case
wide open, then, haven't you?

444
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:27,989
Alan Turing's war records aren't
just classified, they're nonexistent.

445
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:31,626
That means someone's got rid of them.
Erased them. Burned them.

446
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:35,564
And that same person broke into
his house and stole nothing?

447
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:38,400
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

448
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,354
- What, the spies from the papers?
- The Soviet spies.

449
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:45,206
But first they were professors,
weren't they?

450
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:48,610
Radicalized at Cambridge,
then they joined the Communist Party,

451
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,925
then Foreign Office, then leaked
information to Stalin during the war.

452
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:54,516
Now, can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

453
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:57,986
then took up something murky
and top secret when war broke out?

454
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,889
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

455
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:07,314
I think something very serious is happening
right here under our noses.

456
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:10,199
Wouldn't you like
to find out what it is?

457
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,633
Welcome, ladies.
If you'd like to follow me.

458
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:49,756
<i>Some people thought we were
at war with the Germans...</i>

459
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,342
<i>Incorrect.
We were at war with the clock.</i>

460
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,077
<i>Britain was literally starving to death.</i>

461
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:01,649
<i>The Americans sent over 100,000 tons
of food every week, and every week</i>

462
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:06,121
<i>the Germans would send our desperately
needed bread to the bottom of the ocean.</i>

463
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:10,558
<i>Our daily failure was announced
at the chimes of midnight.</i>

464
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:14,529
<i>And the sound would haunt
our unwelcome dreams.</i>

465
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:17,065
<i>Tick... tock...</i>

466
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:18,233
<i>tick.</i>

467
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,409
Damn it!

468
00:39:28,476 --> 00:39:29,960
What just happened?

469
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,747
Midnight, all the work
we've done today is useless.

470
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:37,852
Oh, but don't worry, we've a few hours before
tomorrow's messages start flooding in...

471
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,956
and we start all over again.

472
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:44,726
- From scratch.
- I'm so sick of this.

473
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:47,828
Four hours rewiring
his plugboard matrix.

474
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,665
Three hours yesterday
on his rotor positions!

475
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,501
- Don't go over there.
- Look, John, no.

476
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:56,461
If this job wasn't already
impossible before, it bloody well is now.

477
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,102
Hugh, don't.

478
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:09,817
Damn you and your useless machine.

479
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,387
My machine is how we are going to win.

480
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:14,899
Really?

481
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,935
This machine?

482
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:20,395
Are you talking about
this bloody machine?!

483
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,530
- Hugh! Hugh! Hugh, don't!
- Hugh! Hugh! Stop!

484
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,800
You arrogant bastard.
You could help us.

485
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,536
You could make this go faster,
but you won't.

486
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:31,872
Get off.

487
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:39,472
He's right, Alan.

488
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:45,553
There are actual soldiers out there
trying to win an actual war.

489
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:49,090
My brother protects
food convoys in the Navy.

490
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,559
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

491
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,495
All my friends,
they're all making a difference,

492
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:59,988
while we just while away our days
producing nothing.

493
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,997
Because of you.

494
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:06,407
My machine...

495
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,147
will work.

496
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,897
Come on, Peter.

497
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:53,255
Okay.

498
00:42:22,649 --> 00:42:23,465
Joan?

499
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,440
Will you...

500
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:53,515
Could you make a bit more noise?
I'm not quite sure my landlady woke up.

501
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:56,030
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh... look.

502
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,517
I think that's the best I can do.
No male visitors after dark.

503
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:04,125
So... what did you bring me?

504
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:07,006
- There you go.
- Here.

505
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,931
Some men try flowers, you know.

506
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:15,570
These are actual decrypted Enigma
messages direct from Nazi High Command.

507
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,215
"0600 hours.

508
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:22,376
"Weather today is clear.
Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

509
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:25,813
Well, clearly, that vital piece of
information is going to win us the war.

510
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:27,982
It's the relationship
between the encrypted

511
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:30,785
and decrypted messages
that interests me.

512
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:34,656
Can we find a clue here
that we can build into Christopher?

513
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:38,226
- Who's Christopher?
- Oh, he's my machine.

514
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:39,727
You named him?

515
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:42,316
Is that a bad name?

516
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,849
No.

517
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,197
No, never mind.

518
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,711
Are you trying to build
your universal machine?

519
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,215
- I read your paper at university.
- Is it already being taught?

520
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:06,086
No. No. No, I was precocious. So...

521
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,790
you theorized a machine
that could solve any problem.

522
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,892
It didn't just do one thing,
it did everything.

523
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:14,327
It wasn't just programmable,
it was reprogrammable.

524
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,664
Is that your idea behind Christopher?

525
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:21,169
Well, human brains can compute
large sums very quickly...

526
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:24,639
even Hugh can do that...
but I want Christopher to be smarter.

527
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,100
To make a calculation and then...
to determine what to do next.

528
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,480
Like a person does.

529
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,415
Think of it.

530
00:44:34,515 --> 00:44:36,350
Electrical brain.

531
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,545
- A digital computer.
- Digital computer.

532
00:44:57,484 --> 00:44:59,229
What's going on?

533
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,908
What's happening?

534
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:04,105
- No. No, no. No, no, no! Don't touch that!
- Stay back.

535
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:05,720
That's my desk.

536
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,202
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think
we were searching the wrong one.

537
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:10,852
What are you doing? What's going on?

538
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,288
There is a spy in Bletchley Park.

539
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,925
The Navy thinks that one of us
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

540
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,127
Why?

541
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:24,848
Our boys intercepted this on its way
to Moscow. Look familiar?

542
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:34,007
It's a Beale cipher. Encrypted with
a phrase from a book or a poem or...

543
00:45:40,915 --> 00:45:44,018
You don't seriously think
I did this, do you?

544
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,689
Double agents are such bastards.
Isolated loners.

545
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:53,294
No attachments to friends or family.
Arrogant.

546
00:45:53,394 --> 00:45:55,263
Know anybody like that?

547
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:59,901
I...

548
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:06,841
I know you don't like me,
but that does not make me a Soviet spy.

549
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:09,344
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

550
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:12,614
Really. All right.

551
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:20,254
The Home Office may be protecting you now,
but sooner or later you will make a mistake.

552
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:26,376
And I needn't bother firing you.
They will hang you for treason.

553
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:48,817
Hello.

554
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:52,612
I heard about what happened.

555
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:55,611
It's all the girls in Hut 3
can talk about.

556
00:46:56,924 --> 00:47:00,341
I have an idea
of what might cheer you up.

557
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,712
So, because no letter
can be encoded as itself,

558
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:08,280
there's already a handful of settings
that can be rejected at the outset.

559
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:15,839
- Is that your team?
- Yes.

560
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:17,506
- Shall we say hello?
- No.

561
00:47:17,606 --> 00:47:19,124
Hello.

562
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:22,272
I told you not to do that.

563
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,153
Alan.

564
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:26,636
- Hugh, hello.
- Didn't know you drank.

565
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:29,254
He doesn't, really.
He just sort of sips at the foam.

566
00:47:29,354 --> 00:47:30,892
Well, I'll let you
into a little secret, Miss...?

567
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:32,308
- Clarke.
- Miss Clarke.

568
00:47:32,408 --> 00:47:34,954
- Please.
- Foam's my favorite part, too.

569
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:37,732
- Is it really?
- Come and join us for a drink?

570
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:41,545
- We'll be there in a moment.
- Miss Clarke.

571
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,401
- Well, he likes you.
- Yes.

572
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,260
You...

573
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,948
got him to like you.

574
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:57,334
- Yes.
- Why?

575
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:01,556
Because I'm a woman in a man's job,
and I don't have the luxury of being an ass.

576
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:04,187
Alan...

577
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:08,105
it doesn't matter how smart you are,
Enigma is always smarter.

578
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:12,227
If you really want to solve your puzzle,

579
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,283
then you're going to need
all the help you can get,

580
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:19,170
and they are not going to help you
if they do not like you.

581
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:29,050
- What are those?
- Apples.

582
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,952
- No.
- Oh, they really are.

583
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:35,790
I... well, Miss Clarke, Joan actually...

584
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,428
said that it would be... nice if
I was to bring you all something.

585
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:42,329
So, here we are. I...

586
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:45,299
Thank you. I like apples.

587
00:48:45,499 --> 00:48:47,168
My best to Miss Clarke.

588
00:48:47,268 --> 00:48:51,772
There are two people in a wood,
and they run into a bear.

589
00:48:51,872 --> 00:48:54,041
The first person
gets down on his knees to pray.

590
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,076
The second person
starts lacing up his boots.

591
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:59,213
The first person asks the second person,
"My dear friend, what are you doing?

592
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:02,950
You can't outrun a bear."
To which the second person responds,

593
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,367
"I don't have to.
I only have to outrun you."

594
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:20,520
I'll be with Christopher,
if anyone needs me.

595
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,705
If we assume that the square root
of two is a rational number,

596
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:28,976
then we can say
that the square root of two

597
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:31,779
is A over B...

598
00:49:31,879 --> 00:49:37,673
where A and B are whole numbers
and B is not zero.

599
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:41,756
- Mr. Turing, passing notes, are we?
- No, sir.

600
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:50,565
Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.

601
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:59,907
All right, gentlemen, do not forget
your algebra over the break.

602
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,064
Have a pleasant holiday,

603
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:06,914
and we'll resume
your irrationals when you return.

604
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:45,685
But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.

605
00:50:55,863 --> 00:50:58,532
Here. Look at this.

606
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,637
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

607
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:05,806
it will eliminate rotor positions
500 times faster.

608
00:51:06,706 --> 00:51:08,242
That's...

609
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:10,912
actually not an entirely terrible idea.

610
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:16,287
I think that was Alan for "thank you."

611
00:51:19,186 --> 00:51:22,904
- That's my sandwich.
- You don't like sandwiches.

612
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,178
You nervous?

613
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:02,921
What happens now?

614
00:52:04,404 --> 00:52:08,535
It should work out the day's
Enigma settings.

615
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:24,708
How long?

616
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:39,010
Sieg Heil!

617
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,855
<i>The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,</i>

618
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:48,809
<i>from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark, Norway to France.</i>

619
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:53,114
<i>The Nazi flag now flies from more
than two dozen national capitals.</i>

620
00:52:53,414 --> 00:52:57,151
<i>Their campaign mounts in fury
as a free Europe crumbles.</i>

621
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:40,094
Oh, it's still going.

622
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:42,196
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Margaret.

623
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:44,231
Gears keep spinning on and on.

624
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:47,737
Rotors on and on. It's endless.

625
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:52,031
- With no result in sight?
- No.

626
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:06,776
Turing.

627
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:22,762
- Turing, open the bloody door.
- No. No.

628
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:26,407
Open the door or we'll break it down.

629
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:30,002
I can't let you in!
I cannot let you interfere.

630
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:32,247
Go on, then.

631
00:54:39,386 --> 00:54:40,921
Turn that thing off.

632
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:44,191
No. Don't, please. Please.

633
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:49,161
Please! Please! No! No. No!

634
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:57,605
Well, then, it seems that your great big
expensive machine doesn't work.

635
00:54:58,872 --> 00:55:01,375
- It does.
- Wonderful.

636
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,353
So, you've broken Enigma, then?

637
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:05,818
It was just...

638
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:09,049
still working.

639
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:11,318
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

640
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:15,322
You see, a hundred thousand pounds
is rather a lot of money,

641
00:55:15,422 --> 00:55:17,992
and he's here to see
what you have to show for it.

642
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:21,388
You... will never understand

643
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:25,852
the importance
of what I am creating here!

644
00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:29,541
Have you decrypted any German messages?

645
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:32,111
A single one?

646
00:55:32,806 --> 00:55:36,228
Can you point to anything at all
that you've achieved?

647
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:42,116
Your funding is up,
and our patience is expired.

648
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:46,515
It's with such great pleasure
that I am finally able to say this.

649
00:55:46,615 --> 00:55:49,863
Alan Turing, you're fired.

650
00:55:50,057 --> 00:55:53,894
Please escort Mr. Turing
from the premises.

651
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:55,646
No.

652
00:55:57,064 --> 00:55:59,288
I beg your pardon?

653
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:06,949
If you fire Alan...

654
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:09,510
well, then you'll have to fire me, too.

655
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,414
What on earth are you saying?

656
00:56:12,346 --> 00:56:17,418
Trust me when I tell you there is no one who
would rather say this less than I do, but...

657
00:56:18,152 --> 00:56:21,288
he's right. Alan is right.

658
00:56:21,388 --> 00:56:25,659
His machine can work, and it's probably
the best chance that we've got.

659
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,761
God, it's beyond belief.

660
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:32,377
If you fire them...
you'll have to fire me, too.

661
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,568
And me.

662
00:56:34,668 --> 00:56:37,284
We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

663
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:42,843
Are you going to fire us all? Commander,
at least give us some more time.

664
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:46,660
Six months, and if the machine
doesn't produce any results that we need,

665
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,564
then we'll go back to doing things
the old way. How about that?

666
00:56:56,823 --> 00:56:57,986
One month.

667
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:02,263
And then, so help me God,
you're all gone.

668
00:57:02,363 --> 00:57:04,511
Oh, leave him.

669
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,107
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

670
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:19,213
Oh, and, Alan, your machine...

671
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,651
it better bloody work.

672
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:33,325
Hugh.

673
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,130
I swear...

674
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,433
I'm not a spy.

675
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:42,603
Oh, for God's sake,
of course you're not a bloody spy.

676
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:43,694
What?

677
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:47,374
Denniston gave me the Beale cipher,
and guess what?

678
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:50,411
I cracked it.
"Ask, and it shall be given to you;

679
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:55,088
seek and ye shall find." Matthew 7:7.
That was the key.

680
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:59,243
Far too simple for the likes of you.

681
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,725
Pity Denniston disagrees.

682
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:14,189
Come in.

683
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:18,731
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

684
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:22,640
I tailed him to a pub last night,
where he met a bloke.

685
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,178
They exchanged an envelope.

686
00:58:24,278 --> 00:58:27,721
So, I follow this other fella,
pick him up, give him a good shake.

687
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:33,320
- He's a poofter. He confessed.
- What?

688
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,454
The man admitted it. Arnold Murray.
Hangs around that pub; men pay him for a go.

689
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:41,929
Turing's one of the men that paid.
Only Mr. Murray here

690
00:58:42,029 --> 00:58:46,435
then has the bright idea of robbing
Turing's house after, with a friend.

691
00:58:46,535 --> 00:58:50,771
That's what Turing's hiding.
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

692
00:58:50,871 --> 00:58:52,239
- No.
- What's the matter?

693
00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:54,537
We can charge a university professor
with indecency.

694
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:57,745
No, this is... it's bloody rubbish.
Turing's up to something important...

695
00:58:57,845 --> 00:59:01,491
He's committed a crime and he's broken
the law. And with a bloke.

696
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:06,153
- Jesus Christ, it's bloody disgusting.
- This isn't the investigation I was conducting.

697
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:08,316
- Bring him in.
- Wait.

698
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:14,694
Let me interrogate him. Please.
Give me half an hour alone, and then I swear,

699
00:59:14,794 --> 00:59:18,136
I'll spend the next month running errands
on as many rubbish cases as you like.

700
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:23,072
Fine. Now, will someone get me a warrant
for the arrest of Alan Turing.

701
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,188
Alan?

702
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:44,291
Christopher's simply
not moving fast enough.

703
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:45,521
We should talk.

704
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:48,729
And even with the diagonal board, he's still
not eliminating settings as quickly

705
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:50,798
- as we need him to in order...
- I'm leaving.

706
00:59:50,898 --> 00:59:52,466
But you've just walked in.

707
00:59:52,568 --> 00:59:55,536
No. No. Bletchley.

708
00:59:56,036 --> 00:59:58,405
- What?
- It's my parents.

709
00:59:58,605 --> 01:00:01,689
I'm 25, I'm unmarried, I'm living alone,
and they want me home.

710
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:06,380
- That's ridiculous.
- That's my parents.

711
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,817
You... you can't leave.
I won't let you.

712
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:13,912
"I'll miss you." That's what a normal
person might say in this situation.

713
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:18,505
- I don't care what is normal.
- What am I supposed to do, Alan?

714
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:23,769
I will not... give up my parents.

715
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:29,736
You... you have an opportunity here
to make some actual use of your life.

716
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,372
And end up like you? No, thanks.

717
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:34,574
I'm sorry you're lonely.

718
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:40,414
But Enigma will not save you. Can you
decipher that, you fragile narcissist?

719
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:43,251
Or would you like me to go and fetch
your precious Christopher to help?

720
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:50,824
I'm sorry.

721
01:00:57,764 --> 01:01:00,968
I want you... I want you to stay
because I like you.

722
01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:04,504
I like... talking to you.

723
01:01:05,004 --> 01:01:06,683
I like talking to you, too, Alan.

724
01:01:12,412 --> 01:01:14,948
And what if you weren't alone?

725
01:01:15,248 --> 01:01:17,278
What if you had a husband?

726
01:01:17,985 --> 01:01:19,409
Do you have one in mind?

727
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:21,900
I do.

728
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:23,757
Hugh?

729
01:01:24,257 --> 01:01:26,269
Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that, but...

730
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:29,028
I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.

731
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:35,123
- No, I wasn't thinking of Hugh.
- Or Peter. Peter's so quiet.

732
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,976
- Oh, my God.
- But this makes sense.

733
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:47,759
- Did you just propose to me?
- Well, it is the logical thing to do.

734
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,883
- This is ridiculous.
- This is your parents.

735
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:53,788
I can't... believe
that this is happening.

736
01:01:56,955 --> 01:01:58,668
Joan...

737
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:02,499
- Is your middle name Caroline or Catherine?
- Elizabeth.

738
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,377
Joan Elizabeth... Clarke...

739
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:11,305
will you marry me?

740
01:02:20,547 --> 01:02:22,149
It's beautiful.

741
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:26,062
Well, I know it isn't ordinary, but...

742
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:29,054
whoever loved ordinary?

743
01:02:29,356 --> 01:02:31,758
She had it in both hands...

744
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:34,628
and she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,

745
01:02:34,728 --> 01:02:36,863
"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"

746
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:41,167
And I said, "Yes.
You know, the French way."

747
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:44,404
So, she pops it in,
clamps her lips around it,

748
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:47,308
and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.

749
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:52,546
Come have a dance.

750
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:57,112
No, no, no, you can dance with your fiance
anytime you like. Right now, this moment...

751
01:02:57,212 --> 01:02:58,880
my turn.

752
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:28,248
What's the matter?

753
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,756
What if...

754
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,496
What if I don't fancy being...

755
01:03:43,596 --> 01:03:46,717
with Joan in that way?

756
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,960
Because you're a homosexual?

757
01:03:54,941 --> 01:03:56,083
I suspected.

758
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,647
Well, should I tell her that I've had...

759
01:04:00,747 --> 01:04:02,315
affairs with men?

760
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:07,587
You know, in my...
admittedly limited experience,

761
01:04:07,687 --> 01:04:12,479
women... tend to be a bit touchy about
accidentally marrying homosexuals.

762
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:17,096
Perhaps not spreading this information
about might be in your best interest.

763
01:04:19,766 --> 01:04:22,703
I care for her, I truly do. I...

764
01:04:26,106 --> 01:04:29,584
I... I just don't know if I can...

765
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:33,477
- ...pretend.
- You can't tell anyone, Alan.

766
01:04:34,147 --> 01:04:35,916
It's illegal.

767
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:39,828
And Denniston is looking for
any excuse he can to put you away.

768
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,990
- I know.
- This has to stay a secret.

769
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,996
Come on, it's your turn.

770
01:04:46,126 --> 01:04:46,999
Okay.

771
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:12,846
- Cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

772
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,129
Mr. Turing, can I tell you a secret?

773
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:32,634
- I'm quite good with those.
- I'm here to help you.

774
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:37,088
Oh, clearly.

775
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:45,879
Can machines think?

776
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,167
Oh, so, you've read some
of my published works?

777
01:06:49,415 --> 01:06:51,651
What makes you say that?

778
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:54,220
Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station,

779
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,957
accused of entreating
a young man to touch my penis

780
01:06:57,057 --> 01:07:00,995
and you just asked me
if machines can think.

781
01:07:02,629 --> 01:07:04,607
Well, can they?

782
01:07:05,765 --> 01:07:09,348
Could machines ever think
as human beings do?

783
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:12,005
Most people say not.

784
01:07:12,405 --> 01:07:14,447
You're not most people.

785
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:19,980
Well, the problem is you're...
asking a stupid question.

786
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,348
I am?

787
01:07:22,448 --> 01:07:27,487
Of course machines
can't think as people do.

788
01:07:27,587 --> 01:07:31,925
A machine is different... from a person.

789
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:35,362
Hence, they think differently.

790
01:07:38,464 --> 01:07:40,063
The interesting question is,

791
01:07:40,163 --> 01:07:42,981
just because something
thinks differently from you,

792
01:07:43,081 --> 01:07:46,620
does that mean it's not thinking?

793
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:52,741
Well, we allow for humans to have
such divergences from one another.

794
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,784
You like strawberries,
I hate ice-skating,

795
01:07:57,884 --> 01:08:00,620
you... cry at sad films,

796
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,003
I... am allergic to pollen.

797
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:08,919
What is the point of different tastes,
different...

798
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:15,281
preferences if not to say that our brains
work differently, that we think differently?

799
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:22,042
If we can say that about one another, then
why can't we say the same thing for brains...

800
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:25,578
built of copper and wire, steel?

801
01:08:26,278 --> 01:08:28,080
And that's...

802
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,317
this big paper you wrote?
What's it called?

803
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,326
"The Imitation Game."

804
01:08:34,426 --> 01:08:36,525
Right, that's... that's what it's about?

805
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:45,312
- Would you like to play?
- Play?

806
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:46,766
It's a game.

807
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,302
A test of sorts.

808
01:08:49,802 --> 01:08:54,626
For determining whether something is a...
a machine or a human being.

809
01:08:55,406 --> 01:08:56,643
How do I play?

810
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:58,778
Well, there's a judge
and a subject, and...

811
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:01,881
the judge asks questions, and...

812
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:06,285
depending on the subject's answers,
determines who he is talking with...

813
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:09,790
what he is talking with, and...

814
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,084
All you have to do is ask me a question.

815
01:09:19,298 --> 01:09:23,104
- What did you do during the war?
- I worked in a radio factory.

816
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:27,559
What did you really do during the war?

817
01:09:32,078 --> 01:09:34,231
Are you paying attention?

818
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:54,058
Damn it!

819
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:05,645
We're soon out of time. A month.

820
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:07,580
So, that's it, then, is it?

821
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,716
Oh, the trouble is, it doesn't matter
how much we improve it.

822
01:10:09,816 --> 01:10:12,883
The machine's never gonna be able
to process 159 million million million

823
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:16,489
possibilities in time.
It's just bloody hopeless.

824
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:19,811
It's searching. It's just... It...

825
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,596
doesn't know what it's searching for.

826
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,398
If we knew what the messages
were going to say...

827
01:10:24,498 --> 01:10:28,571
If we knew what the messages were going to say,
we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.

828
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:35,185
Who's Alan's friend?

829
01:10:35,574 --> 01:10:38,078
Hugh. He's a bit of a cad, actually.

830
01:10:38,778 --> 01:10:40,176
So, my type, then?

831
01:10:40,276 --> 01:10:44,284
- Well, I'll introduce you.
- No. He'll come over.

832
01:10:44,384 --> 01:10:46,419
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

833
01:10:46,519 --> 01:10:49,356
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago
and haven't looked back since.

834
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:53,293
Who's that with Joan?

835
01:10:55,361 --> 01:10:57,130
Helen. Works with her.

836
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,533
- She's really pretty.
- She wants me to come over.

837
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:03,002
What? How on earth can you know that?

838
01:11:03,402 --> 01:11:07,416
She smiled at me a while back
and she hasn't looked again since.

839
01:11:12,545 --> 01:11:14,094
And got him.

840
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:17,392
Now, why is this, that when I was single
I found it very boring,

841
01:11:17,492 --> 01:11:20,120
but now that I'm engaged,
I just find it dreadfully fun.

842
01:11:22,955 --> 01:11:24,224
Bingo. She's in.

843
01:11:24,624 --> 01:11:28,495
- Alan, introduce us.
- What? Why me?

844
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:32,421
Because there's nothing like a friend's
engagement to make a woman

845
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:36,302
want to do something she'll later regret
with the fiance's better looking chum.

846
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,095
Let's go.

847
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,912
Half a crown says Alan
bollixes this up entirely.

848
01:11:46,212 --> 01:11:47,280
No bet.

849
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,149
- Alan Turing has a theory.
- He has many.

850
01:11:50,249 --> 01:11:54,921
He believes that the regulations against men
and women working side by side are sound

851
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:57,590
because such proximity
will necessarily lead to romance.

852
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,906
What? No, I don't. I...

853
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:01,800
- However I disagree.
- You do?

854
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,031
Yeah. I think that if I were working
beside a woman all day long,

855
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:10,170
I could appreciate her abilities
and intellect without taking her to bed.

856
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,672
I'm sorry, have we met?

857
01:12:13,172 --> 01:12:17,110
- I don't recall. But let's assume we haven't.
- Helen Stewart. Hugh Alexander.

858
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,191
So, who do you agree with,
Alan or myself?

859
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,780
Well, Alan, of course.

860
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,933
I'm very flattered, really,
but I don't think...

861
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:25,631
Rubbish.

862
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:27,734
Well, I work beside a man every day,

863
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:30,289
and I can't help but have developed
a bit of a crush on him.

864
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,291
Well, who is this man?
So I can kick his arse.

865
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:34,394
Well, there's no need to worry,
it's been chaste.

866
01:12:34,494 --> 01:12:37,140
We've never even met. He's a German.

867
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,459
Now I really want to kill him.

868
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:43,336
How do you mean
you work alongside a German?

869
01:12:43,936 --> 01:12:47,540
Well, each of us intercepts messages
from a specific German radio tower.

870
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,610
So, we have a counterpart on the other side
who's tip-tapping out the messages.

871
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,481
Everyone types a touch differently, so you
get to know the rhythm of your counterpart.

872
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:58,518
It's strangely intimate.
I feel as if I know him so well.

873
01:12:58,618 --> 01:13:02,455
It's a pity he has a girlfriend, but that's
why I disagree with you, Mr. Alexander.

874
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:05,925
Because I'm in love with a coworker
of sorts, and we've never even met.

875
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,862
Well, allow me to buy you another pint,
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.

876
01:13:09,962 --> 01:13:11,597
Let's.

877
01:13:11,697 --> 01:13:13,081
Excellent.

878
01:13:15,668 --> 01:13:17,174
Thanks.

879
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:21,585
Pints. Have you got any sloe gin?

880
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:26,679
In case you were wondering,
that's what flirting looks like.

881
01:13:26,879 --> 01:13:28,314
Helen...

882
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:30,414
Alan?

883
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,551
Yes, Alan?

884
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:35,536
Why do you think your German counterpart
has a girlfriend?

885
01:13:35,636 --> 01:13:39,081
- It's just a stupid joke, don't worry.
- No, no, no, no. Tell me.

886
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,663
Well, each of his messages
begins with the same five letters:

887
01:13:42,763 --> 01:13:47,154
C-I-L-L-Y. So, I suspect that Cilly
must be the name of his amore.

888
01:13:47,254 --> 01:13:50,413
But that's impossible. The Germans
are instructed to use five random letters

889
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:53,272
- at the start of every message.
- Well, this bloke doesn't.

890
01:13:53,872 --> 01:13:56,642
Love will make a man do
strange things, I suppose.

891
01:13:56,742 --> 01:14:01,250
In this case, love just lost Germany
the whole bloody war.

892
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:03,546
Go, Peter.

893
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,202
Sorry.

894
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,307
Alan! Alan!

895
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,619
Alan! I just want...

896
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:22,935
Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.
Peter bloody Hilton.

897
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:24,141
Alan?

898
01:14:25,755 --> 01:14:27,132
What...?

899
01:14:29,608 --> 01:14:30,610
What...

900
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,346
What if... what if Christopher

901
01:14:33,446 --> 01:14:36,416
doesn't have to search through
all of the settings?

902
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:38,551
What if he only has to search through

903
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:42,161
ones that produce words we already
know will be in the message?

904
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:44,991
- Repeated words, predictable words.
- Exactly.

905
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,328
Look, look, like this one.

906
01:14:49,428 --> 01:14:53,665
"0600 hours. Weather today is clear.
Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

907
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:58,104
Well, that's it. Exactly.

908
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:01,540
They send a weather report
every day at 6:00 a.m.

909
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,507
So, that's three words we know will be
in every 6:00 a.m. message...

910
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:08,908
"weather," obviously, and...

911
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:11,817
- Heil bloody Hitler.
- Heil bloody Hitler.

912
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,666
Here's the 6:00 message
from this morning.

913
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,630
Hugh, the the right-hand
letter wheel, set them to...

914
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,065
I know, I know. "Weather" and "Hitler."

915
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:29,798
Peter, John, run voltages through
those letters, through the back scramblers.

916
01:15:29,898 --> 01:15:31,220
So, we'll use the loops?

917
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,639
Yes. Joan, what was

Come on. Come on. Come on, Christopher.

925
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:26,030
Oh, my God.

926
01:16:33,265 --> 01:16:34,600
What happened?

927
01:16:36,568 --> 01:16:38,337
- Did it work?
- Alan?

928
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:40,407
Alan! Alan!

929
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:46,980
I need a new message.
The latest intercept.

930
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:52,500

Turns out that's the only German
you need to know to break Enigma.

01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:52,701

R.

961
01:19:12,691 --> 01:19:14,660
My God, you did it.

962
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,831
You just defeated Nazism
with a crossword puzzle.

963
01:19:18,931 --> 01:19:22,868
There are five people in the world who know
the position of every ship in the Atlantic.

964
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:25,404
- They're all in this room.
- Oh, good God.

965
01:19:25,604 --> 01:19:27,912
Oh, I don't think even He has the power
that we do right now.

966
01:19:28,012 --> 01:19:32,888
No. There's going to be an attack on a
British passenger convoy. Right there.

967
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:36,121
God, you're right. All those U-boats
are only 20, 30 minutes away.

968
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:38,651
Civilians. Hundreds of them.
We can save their lives.

969
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:41,334
I'll phone Denniston's office
so that he can alert the Admiralty.

970
01:19:41,434 --> 01:19:44,390
- Do you think there's enough time to save them?
- There should be, if we can get a message...

971
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,592
Commander Denniston's office, please.
It's urgent.

972
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:47,906
No.

973
01:19:48,006 --> 01:19:50,937
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't call Denniston.

974
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:54,217
- You can't tell him about the attack.
- What are you talking about?

975
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:56,269
We can have air support over
that convoy in ten minutes.

976
01:19:56,369 --> 01:20:00,572
- Let the U-boats sink the convoy.
- It's been a big day, maybe you're suffering...

977
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:03,379
- We don't have time...
- No!

978
01:20:04,476 --> 01:20:06,994
- Hugh! Hugh! That's enough! That's enough!
- Stop, Hugh!

979
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,447
John, the attack is in minutes.

980
01:20:10,282 --> 01:20:13,807
Yes, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

981
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:18,358
You know why people like violence, Hugh?

982
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:21,226
It's because it feels good.

983
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,797
Sometimes we can't do what feels good.

984
01:20:24,997 --> 01:20:28,467
- We have to do what is logical.
- What's logical?

985
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:32,838
Hardest time to lie to somebody
is when they're expecting to be lied to.

986
01:20:32,938 --> 01:20:35,074
- Oh, God.
- What?

987
01:20:35,174 --> 01:20:39,544
If someone's waiting for a lie,
you can't just give them one.

988
01:20:40,445 --> 01:20:43,935
- Damn it, Alan's right.
- What?

989
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:47,920
What would the Germans think
if we destroy their U-boats?

990
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:51,690
- Nothing. They'll be dead.
- No.

991
01:20:52,236 --> 01:20:53,359
No, you can't be right.

992
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:57,529
So, our convoy
suddenly veers off course...

993
01:20:57,629 --> 01:20:59,331
a squadron of our air bombers

994
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:03,035
miraculously descends
on the coordinates of the U-boats...

995
01:21:04,135 --> 01:21:07,007
what will the Germans think?

996
01:21:09,173 --> 01:21:12,478
The Germans will know
that we have broken Enigma.

997
01:21:12,978 --> 01:21:16,515
They'll stop all radio
communications by midday,

998
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:19,003
and they'll have changed the design
of Enigma by the weekend.

999
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:20,802
Yes.

1000
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:23,955
Two years' work.

1001
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:28,493
Everything that we've done here
will all be for nothing.

1002
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,411
There are 500 civilians in that convoy.

1003
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:34,662
Women, children.

1004
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:36,635
We're about to let them die.

1005
01:21:36,735 --> 01:21:42,382
Our job is not to save one passenger
convoy, it is to win the war.

1006
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:46,720
- Our job was to crack Enigma.
- We've done that.

1007
01:21:47,512 --> 01:21:49,649
Now for the hard part.

1008
01:21:50,749 --> 01:21:53,862
- Keeping it a secret.
- Carlisle.

1009
01:21:53,962 --> 01:21:55,421
What?

1010
01:21:55,521 --> 01:21:58,256
The convoy you're about to... it's...

1011
01:21:58,356 --> 01:22:01,094
The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.

1012
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:07,266
We can't act on every piece of intelligence.
So, fine, we won't.

1013
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:11,537
- Just this one.
- Peter, what's the matter with you?

1014
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:16,886
My brother's...
well, he's on the Carlisle.

1015
01:22:19,077 --> 01:22:20,996
A gunnery ensign.

1016
01:22:23,915 --> 01:22:25,440
I'm...

1017
01:22:27,152 --> 01:22:28,689
I'm so sorry.

1018
01:22:30,357 --> 01:22:33,726
Who the hell do you think you are?

1019
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:37,375
This... this is my brother.

1020
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:41,400
He's my big brother, all right, and you have
a few minutes to call off his murder.

1021
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:43,636
We can't.

1022
01:22:46,204 --> 01:22:48,030
He's right.

1023
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,381
Alan.

1024
01:22:51,109 --> 01:22:52,844
Joan.

1025
01:22:54,446 --> 01:22:57,827
Hugh. John.

1026
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,586
Please, I...

1027
01:23:00,886 --> 01:23:04,056
The Germans, they won't get suspicious
just because we stop one attack.

1028
01:23:04,706 --> 01:23:06,592
No one will know.

1029
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:10,601
I'm asking you as your friend.

1030
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,659
Please.

1031
01:23:16,268 --> 01:23:17,770
I'm so sorry.

1032
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:22,908
You're not God, Alan, you don't get
to decide who lives and who dies.

1033
01:23:23,358 --> 01:23:25,328
Yes, we do.

1034
01:23:28,146 --> 01:23:29,248
Why?

1035
01:23:29,648 --> 01:23:32,421
Because no one else can.

1036
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:22,337
Why are you telling me this?

1037
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:29,268
We need your help to keep this
a secret from Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1038
01:24:30,008 --> 01:24:32,978
No one can know we broke Enigma.

1039
01:24:33,742 --> 01:24:35,508
Not even Denniston.

1040
01:24:35,608 --> 01:24:37,549
Who's in the process
of having you fired.

1041
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:39,498
You can take care of that.

1042
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:45,398
While we develop a system to help you
determine how much intelligence to act on...

1043
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:48,555
which attacks to stop,
which to let through.

1044
01:24:48,655 --> 01:24:50,327
Statistical analysis.

1045
01:24:50,427 --> 01:24:54,967
The minimal number of actions
it would take for us to win the war...

1046
01:24:55,367 --> 01:24:59,822
but the maximum number we can take
before the Germans get suspicious.

1047
01:25:00,572 --> 01:25:04,347
And you're going to trust all this
to statistics?

1048
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:06,745
- To maths?
- Correct.

1049
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:10,315
And then MI6 can come up with the lies
that we tell everybody else.

1050
01:25:10,915 --> 01:25:15,331
You'll need a believable alternative source
for all the pieces of information you use.

1051
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:18,515
A false story so that we can explain
how we got our information

1052
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:20,492
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

1053
01:25:20,592 --> 01:25:23,762
And then you can leak
those stories to the Germans.

1054
01:25:23,862 --> 01:25:25,894
And then to our own military.

1055
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:36,309
Maintain a conspiracy of lies
at the highest levels of government.

1056
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:46,438
Sounds right up my alley.

1057
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:53,224
Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,

1058
01:25:53,324 --> 01:25:56,629
but you are exactly the man
I always hoped you would be.

1059
01:26:10,642 --> 01:26:13,447
<i>They code-named it "Ultra."</i>

1060
01:26:13,745 --> 01:26:17,959
<i>It became the largest store
of military intelligence in...</i>

1061
01:26:18,059 --> 01:26:20,819
<i>the history of the world.</i>

1062
01:26:26,725 --> 01:26:30,228
<i>It was like having a tap
on Himmler's intercom.</i>

1063
01:26:30,862 --> 01:26:32,930
I-E-O...

1064
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:37,069
<i>Secrecy became the primary concern,</i>

1065
01:26:37,169 --> 01:26:40,741
<i>and for some reason, they...
they trusted me.</i>

1066
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:45,455
Peter, do you have the...

1067
01:26:45,555 --> 01:26:47,846
630 decryp...

1068
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:29,578
<i>It's a Beale cipher encrypted
with a phrase from a book or...</i>

1069
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:33,019
<i>"Ask, and it will be given to you;
seek and you will find."</i>

1070
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:35,427
<i>Matthew 7:7. That was the key.</i>

1071
01:27:35,572 --> 01:27:38,203
Peter will come around eventually.

1072
01:27:46,705 --> 01:27:48,607
Jack.

1073
01:27:48,707 --> 01:27:50,575
Could you give Alan and me
a moment, please?

1074
01:28:02,621 --> 01:28:06,224
The Soviets and us,
we're on the same side.

1075
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:08,994
What I'm doing will help Britain.

1076
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:11,863
I have to tell Denniston.

1077
01:28:12,465 --> 01:28:14,532
No, you don't.

1078
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,229
Because if you tell him my secret...

1079
01:28:18,069 --> 01:28:19,680
I'll tell him yours.

1080
01:28:22,006 --> 01:28:24,899
Do you know what they do to homosexuals?

1081
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:29,014
You'll never be able to work again,
never be able to teach.

1082
01:28:29,114 --> 01:28:31,216
Your precious machine...

1083
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:33,653
I doubt you'll ever see him again.

1084
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:54,272
Hello. Can I... can I speak to
Stewart Menzies, please? It's urgent.

1085
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:56,298
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1086
01:28:59,611 --> 01:29:01,614
<i>Hello. Menzies.</i>

1087
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:07,633
<i>Some advice about keeping secrets.</i>

1088
01:29:09,854 --> 01:29:13,131
<i>It's a lot easier if you don't
know them in the first place.</i>

1089
01:29:14,692 --> 01:29:18,364
<i>Were they steaming my letters,
tapping my telephone?</i>

1090
01:29:19,164 --> 01:29:21,736
<i>Trailing my nervous walks?</i>

1091
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,681
<i>You know, I...</i>

1092
01:29:24,836 --> 01:29:27,182
<i>I never did find out.</i>

1093
01:29:27,482 --> 01:29:29,024
Joan?

1094
01:29:33,344 --> 01:29:35,871
Joan? What's...

1095
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,319
Where's Joan?

1096
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:43,815
Military prison.

1097
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,718
What have you done?

1098
01:29:47,818 --> 01:29:51,033
Decoded Enigma intercepts. I found
a pile of them in the bedside table.

1099
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:56,601
No, no. I gave those to her over a year ago
when I was trying to figure out

1100
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:58,403
- a link between...
- I'm sure you did.

1101
01:29:58,503 --> 01:30:03,341
Denniston's been looking for a Soviet spy.
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1102
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:06,475
I know who the spy is.

1103
01:30:07,145 --> 01:30:09,532
It's not Joan. It's...

1104
01:30:10,715 --> 01:30:12,651
it's Cairncross.

1105
01:30:12,951 --> 01:30:16,688
I found the Beale cipher, the Bible.

1106
01:30:17,488 --> 01:30:20,011
God, I wish you'd been a spy.

1107
01:30:21,395 --> 01:30:24,059
You'd be so much better
at this than he is.

1108
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,697
You knew it was him?

1109
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:31,002
Of course I bloody knew.
I knew before he came to Bletchley.

1110
01:30:31,604 --> 01:30:33,171
Why do you think I had him placed here?

1111
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:35,840
But we have an Enigma machine.

1112
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,576
Yeah, Polish Intelligence...

1113
01:30:38,251 --> 01:30:40,635
You placed a...

1114
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,448
a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?

1115
01:30:43,548 --> 01:30:46,885
It's really quite useful to be able
to leak whatever we want to Stalin.

1116
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,931
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1117
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:54,526
He won't share a shred of intelligence
with the Soviets.

1118
01:30:55,226 --> 01:30:59,205
Not even information that will help them
against the Germans. There's...

1119
01:30:59,305 --> 01:31:00,686
so much secrecy.

1120
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:05,303
Cairncross has no idea
we know, of course.

1121
01:31:05,403 --> 01:31:08,226
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1122
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,336
Which is why I need your help.

1123
01:31:11,636 --> 01:31:13,278
I want to know what to leak to John,

1124
01:31:13,378 --> 01:31:16,214
what to feed to the Soviets,
as well as the British.

1125
01:31:18,169 --> 01:31:21,082
I'm not a spy. I'm...

1126
01:31:21,182 --> 01:31:22,678
I'm just a mathematician.

1127
01:31:23,989 --> 01:31:26,825
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1128
01:31:27,425 --> 01:31:30,382
You've got more secrets
than the best of them.

1129
01:31:34,832 --> 01:31:38,236
You... you have to promise me
that you will release Joan.

1130
01:31:39,036 --> 01:31:44,109
Yes, Joan's at the market.
She's gonna be back in an hour. I lied.

1131
01:31:45,009 --> 01:31:46,845
I better hold on to these.

1132
01:31:47,045 --> 01:31:51,136
If anybody finds out about them,
prison will be the least of her worries.

1133
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:55,474
Oh, Alan...

1134
01:31:56,253 --> 01:31:59,217
we're gonna have
such a wonderful war together.

1135
01:32:18,342 --> 01:32:20,637
- I need you to leave Bletchley.
- What?

1136
01:32:20,737 --> 01:32:24,975
It's Menzies. I don't trust him.
It's not safe here.

1137
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,719
- Do you think it's any safer anywhere else?
- You need to get away.

1138
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:31,240
- You need to get very far away from me.
- Alan, what's happened?

1139
01:32:35,379 --> 01:32:36,695
We can't be engaged anymore.

1140
01:32:36,795 --> 01:32:41,834
You... your parents need to take you back
and find you a husband elsewhere.

1141
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:45,042
What's wrong with you?

1142
01:32:46,537 --> 01:32:49,540
I have something to tell you.

1143
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,388
I'm...

1144
01:32:54,078 --> 01:32:55,748
I'm a homosexual.

1145
01:32:58,716 --> 01:32:59,818
All right.

1146
01:32:59,918 --> 01:33:02,781
No, no. Men, Joan...

1147
01:33:03,754 --> 01:33:06,373
- not women.
- So what?

1148
01:33:06,673 --> 01:33:09,974
- Well, I just told you.
- So what?

1149
01:33:12,897 --> 01:33:15,733
I had my suspicions; I always did.

1150
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:20,104
But we're not like other people.
We love each other in our own way,

1151
01:33:20,204 --> 01:33:22,573
and we can have the life
together that we want.

1152
01:33:22,673 --> 01:33:24,709
You... you won't be
the perfect husband.

1153
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:28,913
Well, I can promise you, I have no
intention of being the perfect wife.

1154
01:33:29,013 --> 01:33:33,533
I'll not be... fixing your lamb all day
while you come home from the office.

1155
01:33:33,818 --> 01:33:35,468
I'll work.

1156
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,655
You'll work.

1157
01:33:39,257 --> 01:33:41,565
And we'll have each other's company.

1158
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:44,128
We'll have each other's minds.

1159
01:33:44,726 --> 01:33:47,566
That sounds like
a better marriage than most.

1160
01:33:49,934 --> 01:33:52,613
Because I care for you.

1161
01:33:52,971 --> 01:33:55,106
And you care for me.

1162
01:33:56,708 --> 01:34:00,747
And we understand one another more than...
more than anyone else ever has.

1163
01:34:02,647 --> 01:34:04,218
I don't.

1164
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,355
- What?
- Care for you.

1165
01:34:10,455 --> 01:34:11,856
I never did.

1166
01:34:11,956 --> 01:34:14,926
I just needed you to break Enigma.

1167
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:17,764
I've done that now, so... so you can go.

1168
01:34:23,468 --> 01:34:25,837
I'm not going anywhere.

1169
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:30,275
I've spent entirely too much of my life
worried about what you think of me,

1170
01:34:30,575 --> 01:34:32,276
or what my parents think of me,

1171
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:36,214
or the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3.
And do you know what? I'm done.

1172
01:34:37,614 --> 01:34:40,985
This is the most important work
I will ever do,

1173
01:34:41,085 --> 01:34:44,442
and no one is going to stop me.
Least of all, you.

1174
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:50,395
You know what, they were right.

1175
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:54,165
Peter, Hugh, John.

1176
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:58,126
You really are a monster.

1177
01:35:16,853 --> 01:35:20,289
The war dragged on for two more...

1178
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:22,860
solitary years...

1179
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:28,944
and every day we performed
our blood-soaked calculus.

1180
01:35:30,244 --> 01:35:33,104
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1181
01:35:33,204 --> 01:35:35,335
Every day we...

1182
01:35:35,435 --> 01:35:39,411
<i>helped the Allies to victories,
and nobody knew.</i>

1183
01:35:42,402 --> 01:35:43,544
<i>Stalingrad.</i>

1184
01:35:44,716 --> 01:35:47,786
<i>The Ardenne. The invasion of Normandy.</i>

1185
01:35:48,944 --> 01:35:50,821
<i>All victories
that would not have been possible</i>

1186
01:35:50,921 --> 01:35:53,296
<i>without the intelligence
that we supplied.</i>

1187
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:56,494
<i>And people...</i>

1188
01:35:56,594 --> 01:36:00,599
<i>talk about the war
as this epic battle between...</i>

1189
01:36:00,699 --> 01:36:02,734
<i>civilizations...</i>

1190
01:36:03,534 --> 01:36:08,026
<i>freedom versus tyranny,
democracy versus Nazism,</i>

1191
01:36:08,539 --> 01:36:12,746
<i>armies of millions
bleeding into the ground,</i>

1192
01:36:12,846 --> 01:36:15,917
<i>fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans,</i>

1193
01:36:16,347 --> 01:36:20,523
<i>planes dropping bombs from the sky
until they obliterated the sun itself...</i>

1194
01:36:22,053 --> 01:36:25,324
<i>the war wasn't like that for us.</i>

1195
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:29,020
<i>For us, it was just...</i>

1196
01:36:31,262 --> 01:36:36,137
<i>half a dozen crossword enthusiasts
in a tiny village in the South of England.</i>

1197
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:37,917
<i>This is...</i>

1198
01:36:38,669 --> 01:36:40,505
<i>your victory.</i>

1199
01:36:40,605 --> 01:36:42,378
<i>Victory...</i>

1200
01:36:43,216 --> 01:36:46,344
<i>of the cause of freedom</i>

1201
01:36:46,444 --> 01:36:47,571
<i>in every land.</i>

1202
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:55,920
<i>This is a solemn but glorious hour.</i>

1203
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,325
<i>I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt
had lived to see this day.</i>

1204
01:37:02,092 --> 01:37:04,344
<i>Was I God? No.</i>

1205
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:07,618
<i>Because... God didn't win the war.</i>

1206
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:10,302
<i>We did.</i>

1207
01:37:22,613 --> 01:37:25,821
So, what happens now?

1208
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:30,288
Is it... back to university
for us, I suppose?

1209
01:37:30,388 --> 01:37:31,605
Yes, pretty much.

1210
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:35,531
But you've one thing left to do before your
service to your government in concluded.

1211
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,630
- What's that?
- Burn everything.

1212
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:41,888
- Burn? Why?
- You were told when you started

1213
01:37:41,988 --> 01:37:45,543
this was a top-secret program.
Did you think we were joking?

1214
01:37:45,643 --> 01:37:49,507
- But the war is over.
- This war is. But there'll be others.

1215
01:37:49,907 --> 01:37:55,380
And we know how to break a code that
everybody else believes is unbreakable.

1216
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,306
Precisely.

1217
01:37:58,616 --> 01:38:00,418
Tear it down. Light it up.

1218
01:38:00,518 --> 01:38:03,854
Sweep away the ashes.
None of you have ever met before.

1219
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:07,170
None of you have ever even heard
the word Enigma.

1220
01:38:09,326 --> 01:38:11,534
Have a safe trip home.

1221
01:38:14,498 --> 01:38:16,207
Behave.

1222
01:38:16,607 --> 01:38:19,015
With a bit of luck, you'll never
have to see me or one another again

1223
01:38:19,115 --> 01:38:20,626
for the rest of your lives.

1224
01:38:36,253 --> 01:38:38,311
That's unbelievable.

1225
01:38:39,924 --> 01:38:43,178
Now, Detective,

1226
01:38:43,794 --> 01:38:46,664
you get to judge.

1227
01:38:47,998 --> 01:38:49,875
So, tell me...

1228
01:38:51,369 --> 01:38:53,044
what am I?

1229
01:38:54,705 --> 01:38:56,416
Am I...

1230
01:38:56,716 --> 01:38:59,570
a machine? Am I a person?

1231
01:39:00,244 --> 01:39:02,770
Am I a war hero?

1232
01:39:04,682 --> 01:39:06,924
Am I a criminal?

1233
01:39:10,488 --> 01:39:12,512
I can't judge you.

1234
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,389
Well, then...

1235
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:23,157
you're no help to me at all.

1236
01:39:26,296 --> 01:39:28,439
Come in.

1237
01:39:32,343 --> 01:39:34,345
You wanted to see me, sir?

1238
01:39:34,445 --> 01:39:37,006
Turing. Sit down.

1239
01:39:48,459 --> 01:39:50,661
Something the matter?

1240
01:39:50,761 --> 01:39:53,431
You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.

1241
01:39:53,931 --> 01:39:55,099
I wouldn't say that.

1242
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,703
Well, your mathematics teacher says
the two of you are positively inseparable.

1243
01:39:58,803 --> 01:40:01,639
We're the best students in the class.

1244
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:03,741
He caught you passing notes
the other day.

1245
01:40:03,841 --> 01:40:06,778
Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.

1246
01:40:07,178 --> 01:40:10,781
You and your friend solve
maths problems during maths class

1247
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:13,284
because the maths class is too dull?

1248
01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:15,186
He's not my friend.

1249
01:40:15,286 --> 01:40:18,871
- Well, I'm told he's your only friend.
- Who said that?

1250
01:40:21,692 --> 01:40:24,596
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1251
01:40:25,396 --> 01:40:27,132
Why am I here?

1252
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,047
Christopher is dead.

1253
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:41,445
I don't understand.

1254
01:40:41,545 --> 01:40:46,085
His mother sent word this morning.
The family were on holiday, you see.

1255
01:40:50,354 --> 01:40:51,756
I don't understand.

1256
01:40:51,856 --> 01:40:56,828
Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,
as I'm sure he told you.

1257
01:40:56,928 --> 01:41:01,799
So, this won't come as a shock, but...
still, all the same,

1258
01:41:01,899 --> 01:41:03,573
I'm sorry.

1259
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:06,698
You're mistaken.

1260
01:41:07,872 --> 01:41:10,141
Did he not tell you?

1261
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:15,615
Well, he's been sick for a long time.
He knew this was coming soon.

1262
01:41:16,446 --> 01:41:20,299
But he had a stiff upper lip
about it. Good lad.

1263
01:41:21,918 --> 01:41:23,754
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1264
01:41:23,854 --> 01:41:26,624
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1265
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:31,668
I see. Very well.

1266
01:41:34,732 --> 01:41:37,318
May I leave, Headmaster?

1267
01:41:51,682 --> 01:41:53,917
Congratulations, sir.

1268
01:42:21,012 --> 01:42:22,800
Sorry.

1269
01:42:26,783 --> 01:42:28,891
I would have come.

1270
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:30,866
I would have testified.

1271
01:42:30,966 --> 01:42:34,725
And what would you have said,
that I... I wasn't a homosexual.

1272
01:42:34,925 --> 01:42:38,296
Alan... this is serious.
They could send you to jail.

1273
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:40,898
Damn it.

1274
01:42:43,098 --> 01:42:46,061
- Your hands. You're twitching.
- No, I'm not.

1275
01:42:46,404 --> 01:42:47,509
Alan.

1276
01:42:49,907 --> 01:42:51,928
It's the medication.

1277
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:54,111
The medication?

1278
01:42:55,455 --> 01:42:58,269
Well, the judge gave me a choice...

1279
01:42:59,103 --> 01:43:03,521
either two years in prison
or hormonal therapy.

1280
01:43:03,821 --> 01:43:06,791
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1281
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:10,928
Yes, yes, that's right.
Chemical castration.

1282
01:43:11,128 --> 01:43:15,366
To... to cure me of my
homosexual predilections.

1283
01:43:16,866 --> 01:43:20,805
Well, of course I chose that.
I mean, I... couldn't...

1284
01:43:20,905 --> 01:43:22,907
work in prison, and...

1285
01:43:23,507 --> 01:43:24,376
All right.

1286
01:43:26,844 --> 01:43:29,984
Now, I'm going to speak to your doctors.
I'm going to speak to your lawyers.

1287
01:43:30,084 --> 01:43:31,749
I'm fine.

1288
01:43:31,949 --> 01:43:36,609
- Please let me help you.
- No, I don't need your help, thank you.

1289
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:38,512
Alan, you do not have to do this alone.

1290
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:42,227
I'm not alone.

1291
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:47,320
Never have been.

1292
01:43:51,335 --> 01:43:54,739
Christopher's become so smart.

1293
01:43:56,941 --> 01:44:01,753
If I don't continue my treatment,
then they'll...

1294
01:44:04,648 --> 01:44:07,462
they'll take him away from me.

1295
01:44:08,552 --> 01:44:10,044
You...

1296
01:44:12,523 --> 01:44:16,528
You can't let them do that. You can't.

1297
01:44:17,761 --> 01:44:21,699
You... you can't let them
leave me alone.

1298
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:26,748
I don't... I don't want to be alone.
I don't want to be alone.

1299
01:44:26,848 --> 01:44:29,875
All ri... all right, all right.
All right.

1300
01:44:32,009 --> 01:44:34,335
It's all right. Come and sit down.

1301
01:44:37,247 --> 01:44:40,480
It's all right. Come and sit down.

1302
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:45,230
It's all right.

1303
01:44:55,599 --> 01:44:58,001
Oh, well, that's a...

1304
01:44:59,018 --> 01:45:02,350
that's a much nicer ring
than the one I made you.

1305
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:05,851
Yes. His name's Jock.

1306
01:45:05,951 --> 01:45:08,812
He's an Army man, if you can believe it.

1307
01:45:08,912 --> 01:45:10,920
We work together.

1308
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:17,228
Why don't we do a crossword puzzle.

1309
01:45:18,226 --> 01:45:21,810
It'll only take us five minutes.
Or, in your case, six.

1310
01:45:26,931 --> 01:45:28,720
There.

1311
01:45:52,796 --> 01:45:54,091
Perhaps later.

1312
01:45:55,091 --> 01:45:57,128
Yes, of course.

1313
01:46:02,332 --> 01:46:04,669
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

1314
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:08,205
Work, a husband.

1315
01:46:08,505 --> 01:46:10,601
Normal life.

1316
01:46:20,584 --> 01:46:23,371
No one normal could have done that.

1317
01:46:27,223 --> 01:46:29,215
Do you know, this morning...

1318
01:46:30,415 --> 01:46:34,598
I was on a train that went
through a city that wouldn't exist

1319
01:46:34,698 --> 01:46:36,834
if it wasn't for you.

1320
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:40,748
I bought a ticket from a man

1321
01:46:40,848 --> 01:46:44,932
who would likely be dead
if it wasn't for you.

1322
01:46:45,144 --> 01:46:47,847
I read up on my work...

1323
01:46:48,345 --> 01:46:51,849
a whole field of scientific inquiry

1324
01:46:51,949 --> 01:46:55,939
that only exists because of you.

1325
01:46:58,222 --> 01:47:01,823
Now, if you wish
you could have been normal...

1326
01:47:03,493 --> 01:47:06,431
I can promise you I do not.

1327
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:10,601
The world is an infinitely better place

1328
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:14,231
precisely because you weren't.

1329
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:18,575
Do you...

1330
01:47:19,048 --> 01:47:21,020
do you really think that?

1331
01:47:22,413 --> 01:47:24,232
I think...

1332
01:47:25,215 --> 01:47:28,819
that sometimes it is the people
who no one imagines anything of

1333
01:47:29,519 --> 01:47:34,853
who do the things
that no one can imagine.
