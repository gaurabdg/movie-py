00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back</i>

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>No more, no more
No more, no more</i>

3
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,659
<i>Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more</i>

4
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,699
Hey, it's Monday morning,
and I'm Jack Lucas.

5
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>Hi. This is about my husband.</i>

6
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,968
- Yes?
<i>- Well, he drives me crazy.</i>

7
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>I'll be talking and he'll never
let me finish a sentence.</i>

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,641
<i>He's always finishing...</i>

9
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,811
He's always finishing your
thoughts. That's awful.

10
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,188
<i>It absolutely drives...</i>

11
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,059
it drives you crazy, doesn't it?
He's a scoundrel.

12
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,070
<i>Jack, you've hit the nail...</i>

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,741
Hit the nail on the head. Yeah,
somebody ought to hit you on the head.

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,703
<i>Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back</i>

15
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,455
<i>No more, no more
No more, no more</i>

16
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,626
<i>Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back no more</i>

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>What you say?</i>

18
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:32,383
Tell us, how long have you and
Senator Payton been having this

19
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,845
Sleazy affair?

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,888
<i>Oh, great.</i>

21
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,087
<i>This is great.</i>

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,477
<i>This is disgusting. I'm
so tired of the public</i>

23
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,813
<i>invading a person's private life.</i>

24
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,191
You had sex with a U.S. senator
in the parking lot of Sea World.

25
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,111
You're telling me you're a private
person? No, you're our...

26
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,324
Spotlight Celebrity!

27
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,994
We want to hear about
the back seats of limos,

28
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,997
about the ruined lives
of people we want to be.

29
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,374
New and exotic uses
for champagne corks.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,029
<i>Listen, I have been humiliated
enough already, okay?</i>

31
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,340
Well, no, perhaps not.
We need those details.

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,549
<i>You're a pig, Jack.</i>

33
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,429
Whoa, woman, oh, woman
Don't you treat me so mean

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,015
You're the meanest old woman
That I've ever...

35
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,767
You're on the air, caller.

36
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,894
<i>Hello, Jack. It's Edwin.</i>

37
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,397
Ohh. It's Edwin.

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,484
Haven't heard you in, what,
a day? I've missed you.

39
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,985
<i>I've missed you too.</i>

40
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,529
It's confession time.
What've you got?

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,686
<i>I went to this bar, this very,
you know, hard-to-get-into place</i>

42
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,286
<i>called Babbitt's.</i>

43
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,748
Oh. Yeah, it's one of those
chic, yuppie watering holes.

44
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,917
<i>I met this beautiful woman.</i>

45
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:52,213
Ugh. Come on, Ed. If you start
telling me you're in love again,

46
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,508
I'm gonna remind you of that
time we made you propose

47
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,345
to that checkout girl at Thrifty's.
Do you remember her reaction?

48
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,266
<i>She was just a girl.
This is a beautiful woman.</i>

49
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,352
<i>And Pinocchio is a true story.</i>

50
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,854
You'll never get this tart
to your dessert plate.

51
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,649
<i>- This is different. She likes me.</i>
- Edwin. Edwin. Hey!

52
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,068
Edwin!

53
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,780
I told you about these people.
They only mate with their own kind.

54
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,448
It's yuppie inbreeding.

55
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,077
That's why they're retarded
and wear the same clothes.

56
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,622
They don't feel love. They
only negotiate love moments.

57
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,124
They're evil, Edwin.

58
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,960
They're repulsed by imperfection,
horrified by the banal,

59
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,505
everything that America stands for.
Everything you and I fight for.

60
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:39,252
They must be stopped before
it's too late. It's us or them.

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>Okay, Jack.</i>

62
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,458
All right.

63
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:49,979
Well, it's been a thrill, as always.
Have a perfect day.

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,384
Everyone here at the <i>Jack
Lucas Show</i> says "bye."

65
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,610
This is Jack Lucas.
So long. <i>Arrivederci.</i>

66
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,614
I'll send you a thought today as I
lie in the back of my stretch limo

67
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,492
having sex with the
teenager of my choice.

68
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,828
And that thought will be,

69
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,291
"Thank God I'm me."

70
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,334
<i>I've got the power</i>

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,619
Some of this is very funny.

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,890
Cheever secured the Donna Summer
song to play over the credits.

73
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,089
Ooh. I have chills.

74
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,270
You sure they want me?
I won't read it without an offer.

75
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,355
Of course. Not even a question.

76
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,359
When I talked to him, I could
smell how much they want you.

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,028
I could smell it over the phone.

78
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,190
Oh. Bums.

79
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,076
I don't have any change.

80
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,946
I'm not opening this window.

81
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,610
A couple of quarters isn't gonna
make any difference anyway.

82
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,166
I hate my cheeks.

83
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,132
Raoul called before, about dinner.

84
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,564
About dinner as a concept
or about dinner with Raoul?

85
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,650
You're so witty.

86
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,110
I gotta get out of
here and do something.

87
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,489
You know, tomorrow is a
very big day for me.

88
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,313
It'd be nice if you
pretended to understand.

89
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,868
Fine. I'll say no.

90
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,193
- They're putting me on film tomorrow.
- Fine.

91
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:36,658
First time in my life I'll
be a voice with a body.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,257
You know what that means?
What this could lead to?

93
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,707
It's a sitcom, Jack.
You're not defining pi.

94
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,764
I'll remember that the
next time you get excited

95
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,463
by drawing pubic
hair on Raisin Bran.

96
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,465
You want some?

97
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,604
No, I have to work.

98
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
How un-'60s of you.

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,401
I was 9 in the '60s.

100
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,973
I used to think

101
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,242
my biography ought to be entitled:

102
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:13,023
<i>Jack Lucas: The Face
Behind the Voice.</i>

103
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,783
But now it could be <i>Jack
Lucas: The Face and the Voice.</i>

104
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,421
Or maybe just

105
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,622
<i>Jack!</i> Exclamation point.

106
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,218
Honey?

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,888
Where's my orange cup
with the teddy bear?

108
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,973
I'll kill that old bitch!

109
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,977
I have a fever.
I really think I'm dying.

110

<i>Now he won't do a thing</i>

111

00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,217
Pigs.

157
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,064
Go right ahead. Right ahead.

158
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,433
Hey, Mr. Happiness.

159
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,728
Are you gonna do a little
work today or what?

160
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,473
Hm? What, out there?

161
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,408
They're not terrorists, Jack.

162
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,404
They're just ordinary
people, like you and me.

163
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,991
Breakfast of champions, right?

164
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,422
That one.

165
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,717
It'll be funny, and then
the scary one will do.

166
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,096
That one. A scary one
and a funny one.

167
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,680
Oh. Oh!

168
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,394
Excuse me. Can you help me?

169
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,021
I've looked for an hour,

170
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,731
and I'm losing my mind.

171
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,567
What I'm in the mood for
is a Katharine Hepburn-y,

172
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,444
Cary Grant-y kind of thing.

173
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,404
Nothing heavy.
I couldn't take heavy.

174
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,533
Something zany. I'm looking
for something zany.

175
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:22,371
Or something modern, like a Goldie
Hawn-y, Chevy Chase-y thing.

176
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,125
You know, funny. I wanna laugh.
I have to laugh tonight, really.

177
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,254
Oh, do you have anything with
that comedian? He's on that show.

178
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:35,217
It's <i>On the Radio.</i> You know the
guy. He says, "Hey, forgive me!"

179
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,553
I get such a kick out of
the way he says that.

180
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,221
He's so goddamn adorable.

181
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,546
That would be perfect.
Didn't he make a movie?

182
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,049
<i>Ordinary Peepholes.</i>

183
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,886
It's kind of a big-titty,
spread-cheeky kind of thing.

184
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,232
Excuse me, I just want to
borrow him for a minute.

185
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,192
You're gonna love that.

186
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,086
- Frightening woman.
- Are you in a mood today?

187
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,338
If she didn't get something zany,

188
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,676
- she would've killed us all.
- Are you in an "emotional abyss"?

189
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,638
Will you explain this to me?
I don't understand these moods.

190
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,726
Anne, they're my moods. You wanna
understand? Have your own.

191
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,438
- I hate desperate people.
- Sweetie, baby, love of my life,

192
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,137
you hate people.

193
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,154
Look, why don't you take the day
off, go upstairs, put your feet up?

194
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,809
I'll cook tonight, okay?

195
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,486
Right.

196
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,330
<i>You seen my orange cup
with the teddy bear?</i>

197
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,290
<i>Grandma used it for
her urine specimen.</i>

198
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,752
<i>I'll kill her!</i>

199
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,548
<i>Here I am, I'm dying. The doctors
are dividing up my estate!</i>

200
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,580
<i>I gotta hide my trophy cups in case
Grandma finds herself in a beer hall.</i>

201
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,972
It's funny. What do you want?

202
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,724
It's not funny.

203
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,476
Then why do we watch it?

204
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,896
It makes me feel good to
see how not funny it is.

205
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,150
America doesn't know funny. It makes it
easier not being a funny TV celebrity.

206
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,395
Because that would just mean
I'm not really talented.

207
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,563
You are a sick fuck, you know that?

208
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,661
I don't know why you...

209
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,995
Shh, Shh!

210
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,706
- Don't you do that.
- I'm trying to watch!

211
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,626
You have too many thoughts
rolling around up there.

212
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,505
You're very self-absorbed,
Jack. God, divert yourself.

213
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,006
My God, read a book.

214
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,758
It's important to think.

215
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,915
It separates us from lentils and
people that read books like <i>Love Song.</i>

216
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,131
Great book, dumb title.

217
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,356
You know, you used to say
that you liked that about me.

218
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,318
You said you liked that we didn't
have to think all the time.

219
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,724
That we could just be
together and not think.

220
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:09,064
Well, suicidal paranoiacs will
say anything to get laid.

221
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,044
Have another drink, Jack. It's on
the house, like everything else.

222
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,723
<i>I hope your children treat
you with the same disrespect.</i>

223
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,808
<i>I got a fever. I'm dying.</i>

224
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,060
<i>You're not dying. You have a cold.</i>

225
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,895
<i>Besides, you can't
die before Sunday,</i>

226
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,189
<i>because we have to go
to the Billy Joel concert.</i>

227
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,642
<i>Ah. Well, forgive me!</i>

228
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,948
Madness.

229
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,028
Shit!

230
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,091
Fuck!

231
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,263
Forgive me!

232
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,216
Fuck.

233
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,901
Hey, watch it, asshole!

234
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,522
Well, forgive me, fuckhead!

235
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,167
Hey! Hey, over here!

236
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,945
Here I am!

237
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,951
Oh, taxi!

238
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,909
Hello! Merry Christmas!

239
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,348
Hey, buddy. Buddy, help a guy out.

240
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,309
Help me out with a quarter.
Come on, sport!

241
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,561
- Sport.
- Hey, I told you!

242
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,555
What's the matter with you?

243
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,149
Get away from me! Get away from me!

244
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,442
You're a maniac!

245
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,063
- You're crazy!
- Mr. Bum.

246
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,734
Here.

247
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,552
Hey, anybody here named Jiminy?

248
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,601
You ever read any Nietzsche?

249
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,856
Nietzsche says there are two
kinds of people in the world.

250
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,276
People who are destined
for greatness,

251
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,945
like Walt Disney

252
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
and Hitler.

253
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,199
And then there's the rest of us.

254
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,106
He called us "the bungled
and the botched."

255
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,612
We get teased.

256
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,362
We sometimes get
close to greatness,

257
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,864
but we never get there.

258
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,577
We're the expendable masses.

259
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,600
We get pushed in front of
trains, take poison aspirin,

260
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,505
get gunned down in Dairy Queens.

261
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,943
You wanna hear the new
title of my biography,

262
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,472
my little Italian friend?

263
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,786
<i>It Was No Fucking Picnic:
The Jack Lucas Story.</i>

264
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,110
You like it?

265
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:44,325
<i>Il no-va esta</i> fucking picnic-o.

266
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,662
You're a good kid.

267
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,206
You say no to drugs.

268
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,801
You ever get the feeling sometimes,

269
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,183
you're being punished
for your sins?

270
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,966
Woo-hoo!

271
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,024
Hey, what's going on?

272
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,241
I said, what's going on?

273
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,623
What are you doing here, man?

274
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,758
You shouldn't hang around here!

275
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,253
I was just leaving.

276
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,264
People spend a lot of money
for this neighborhood.

277
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,557
It's not fair.

278
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,768
Looking out their windows to see
your ass asleep on the streets!

279
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,103
Yes, I agree.

280
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,355
Good. That's very good.

281
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,357
Do you believe this drunk?

282
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,402
Me neither, man! Do it!

283
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,909
Hold, varlet!

284
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,063
Or feel the sting of my shaft!

285
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,751
In the name of Blanche de Fleur,

286
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,951
unhand that errant knight!

287
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,381
Do you speak English?

288
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,204
Let the bum go, dipshit!

289
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,473
Mendacity! Why are two
attractive city squires like you

290
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,391
abusing a knight like this?

291
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,934
Are you a faggot too?

292
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,480
Faggot? No, but I do
believe in fairies.

293
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,149
- Not without dinner.
- Are you fucking nuts?

294
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,486
Viola! Let's show
him what he's won!

295
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,404
I advise you to let us go.

296
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,906
You advise us, huh?

297
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,901
Yes. You're outnumbered,
son. Ha-ha-ha.

298
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,187
Can't you see?

299
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,504
Looks like <i>Night of
the Living Dead.</i>

300
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,532
Come on, go for it!

301
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,592
- They can't do nothing!
- Can't do nothing.

302
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,302
Can't do nothing!

303
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,179
Nothing?!

304
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,878
Gentlemen!

305
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,312
I like New York in June

306
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,091
How about you?

307
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,902
I like a Gershwin tune

308
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,613
How about you?

309
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,782
Oh, look. It's showtime.

310
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,325
You know, boys,

311
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,161
there's three things in
this world that you need:

312
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,163
Respect for all kinds of life,

313
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,749
a nice bowel movement
on a regular basis

314
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,029
and a navy blazer.
Oh, and one more thing:

315
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,297
Never take your eye off the ball!

316
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,871
The ability to be a shithead
can be a fabulous advantage.

317
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,054
Hey, hey, hey!

318
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,180
Please. Don't hurt me!

319
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,195
Why? So you can be healthy
when you jump? No.

320
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,566
You can't leave me tied up
out here alone, you faggot!

321
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,452
You're not gonna be alone.

322
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,400
Huh?

323
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,900
Come and get it!

324
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,242
I need a drink.

325
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,785
Hey, I know a fabulous
place with great ambiance.

326
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,226
What do you think of
the death penalty?

327
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,022
Death's definitely a penalty.
Ain't no fucking gift.

328
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,857
Life's too goddamn short.

329
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,358
Great place, huh?

330
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,368
- How are you tonight?
- Not bad, John. You?

331
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,536
Can't complain.

332
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,455
Can I interest anybody
in a fruit pie?

333
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,042
- No, thank you. Too fattening.
- Crazy fucking...

334
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,902
- Have a drink!
- I better be leaving.

335
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,806
- Drink, goddamn it!
- No.

336
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,900
I think they like you.

337
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,915
I like New York in June

338
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,875
How about you?

339
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,370
You were great tonight, Parry.

340
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,256
I like potato chips

341
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,924
Moonlight and roses

342
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,669
How about you?

343
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,672
Hi.

344
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,917
Welcome back.

345
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,095
How you feeling?

346
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,180
- Have I died?
- Oh, no.

347
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,984
Hey, easy, easy. Want to get up?

348
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:45,154
There you go. Gravity works.
Take it real slow. There you go.

349
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,198
Take a few breaths, huh?

350
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,694
- Where am I?
- My domicile.

351
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,787
It's my humble abode.

352
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,836
Want something to eat? Your stomach
must be a real tabula rasa.

353
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:03,298
I don't know if these are raisins
or rat shit. You can't tell.

354
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh. Oh, heh.

355
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,093
How about a fruit pie?

356
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,878
I was off by a couple of months.

357
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,895
It's nice to have company. Hi.

358
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,563
Where are my shoes?

359
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,814
- What?
- Where?

360
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,717
- What? Shh. Shh.
- What?

361
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,719
Excuse me.

362
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,646
What is it? We've got company.

363
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,307
What?

364
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,409
I knew it. I knew it last night.

365
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,244
I did too. I did. Don't...

366
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,067
Don't...

367
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,490
He's the one!

368
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,250
Can you keep a secret?

369
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,919
- No.
- Good.

370
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,255
- Know what the little people told me?
- The little people?

371
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,658
Oh. You know.

372
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,928
They said you're the one.

373
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,298
The one what?

374
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,017
Shut up!

375
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,810
Get away from him!

376
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,270
This'll get rid...

377
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,890
Wintergreen. So sorry about this.

378
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,180
Oh, there we are.

379
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,612
They said you're not
ready to know yet.

380
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,390
I'm not?

381
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,115
He is too!

382
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,784
Get out of here. Fuck off!

383
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,118
Beat it!

384
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,329
I have rights! Oh, yeah.

385
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,082
Fly up there. Oh, yeah.

386
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,585
Come on! Out of here! Yah!

387
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,033
Hey! You can't be in there.

388
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,503
You're frightening him!

389
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,588
Do you know who I am?

390
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,599
- I'm drawing a blank.
- Take a guess.

391
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,002
Let him guess.

392
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,846
Uh...

393
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,066
You seem to be some
kind of vigilante.

394
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,652
That happens along
the way, of course.

395
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,430
Here's a clue.

396
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,369
- A hood ornament?
- No.

397
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,912
I'm a knight.

398
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,065
On a special quest.

399
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,693
And I need help.

400
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,581
Quest?

401
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,092
That's why they sent you.

402
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,837
- The little...
- Yes, yes.

403
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,807
You see, they work for him.

404
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,676
So do I.

405
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,802
Him?

406
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,638
God.

407
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,857
I'm the janitor of God.

408
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,609
I know.

409
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,072
I know how you feel.

410
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,908
They came to me about a year ago.

411
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,204
I was sitting on the john, having a
really satisfying bowel movement.

412
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,624
Those ones that border on
mystical, where you're like:

413
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,080
Oh!

414
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,265
And there they were.

415
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,312
Hundreds of the cutest
little fat people

416
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,216
floating right in front of me.

417
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,443
It was wonderful. And then,

418
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,437
they spoke.

419
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,573
And they said that
I had been chosen

420
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,910
to get back something very
special that he had lost.

421
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,662
My part will be very
dangerous. I said, "Whoa!"

422
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,123
Hold it right there." I mean...

423
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:29,170
if you see floating little fat people
say you're on a mission from God,

424
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:34,092
they'll slap you some heavy
Thorazine. I said, "Give me a sign."

425
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:39,545
And they said, "Look in <i>Progressive
Architecture</i>, February '88, page 33."

426
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,301
That's pretty specific, huh?

427
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,179
Bingo! He knows.

428
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,440
He knows. He does. It's right here.

429
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,640
Where is it? A, B, F, M. M!

430
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,306
Under Miscellaneous, not Mythology.

431
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,100
Look at this. Here it is.

432
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,982
See it?

433
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,333
- Langdon Carmichael.
- No, no.

434
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,211
Right there. See it?

435
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,489
What?

436
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,826
The Grail.

437
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,422
The Holy Grail.

438
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,809
It's God's symbol of divine grace.

439
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,811
- The Holy...
- Yes.

440
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:31,683
Some billionaire has got the Holy
Grail in his library on Fifth Avenue?

441
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,485
I know. Who'd think you'd
find anything divine there?

442
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,823
I don't mean to be flippant or enrage
you, but you're a psychotic man.

443
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,228
- I know.
- A very nice psychotic man.

444
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,871
I appreciate what you did.

445
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,875
- It was a brave and noble thing.
- You're embarrassing me.

446
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:52,962
I'll see a lot of you on various
talk shows when you get the Grail.

447
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,410
Please don't go!

448
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,125
I can't.

449
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,832
I can't get it.

450
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,014
Because he's out there.

451
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,964
He's always out there.

452
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,514
That's why you can get it.
That's why you're the one.

453
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,676
I'm not the one.

454
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,350
I'm not anyone.

455
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,059
Forget about the shoes.

456
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,161
I'm gonna take a cab.

457
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,580
- Parry.
- Parry, I'm Jack.

458
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,233
I know.

459
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:37,757
Oh! Oh, wait! Listen, don't...

460
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,831
They're... Here they are.

461
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,512
Jack. Jack.

462
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,711
Here you go. As they were.

463
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,886
Uh, you can keep the doll.

464
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,013
Hey, thanks a mil, huh?

465
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,944
Now that you know where we
are, don't be a stranger.

466
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,313
Come back. We'll rummage.

467
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,939
Take care of yourself, Jack.
Give my love to the wife.

468
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,482
- I'm not married.
- Really? You look married.

469
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,282
Don't be a stranger.

470
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,826
See you.

471
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,421
Hey. Hey, where you coming from?

472
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,765
The basement, I think.

473
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,068
I tell him no visitors!

474
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,654
- Hey, hold it! Hold it.
- Huh?

475
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,865
- Listen. You a friend of Parry's?
- No.

476
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,867
I don't allow no entertaining.

477
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,454
I let him stay out of the goodness
of my heart because of the tragedy.

478
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,039
But I'm not running a hotel.

479
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,834
And nobody's taking
advantage of me.

480
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,085
Tragedy?

481
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,587
He and his wife were in some bar

482
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,842
and some nut comes in with a
shotgun and blew the place apart.

483
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,996
Splattered her brains
all over the walls.

484
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,597
She was a beautiful girl.

485
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,641
Never knew what hit her.

486
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:15,172
You ought to have heard about that
nut who listened to the radio.

487
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,717
<i>You could've been attacked,
raped, God knows!</i>

488
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,776
I was up all night long, Jack.

489
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,986
Sorry.

490
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,447
- Yeah?
<i>- A guy wants</i>

491
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,476
<i>- to check out the pornos.</i>
- So send him back.

492
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,410
What the hell happened?

493
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,037
I was attacked.

494
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,690
What?

495
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,192
Oh, baby!

496
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,586
- Two kids tried to set me on fire.
- Oh, my God.

497
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,456
- Ow.
- What did they do to you?

498
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,090
You almost done?

499
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,469
- Are you looking for a story?
- I've seen most of them.

500
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,215
Here. <i>Creamer Versus
Creamer.</i> Won an award. Go.

501
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,715
Did you call the police? Do you
want me to call up the doctor?

502
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,051
Are you sure?

503
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,481
So where did you sleep last night?

504
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,019
I stayed at a friend's, Anne.

505
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:15,449
Okay, Jack. I want you to
be up front with me now.

506
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,042
If you're seeing
somebody else, tell me.

507
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,419
Don't pour gasoline
all over yourself

508
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,255
and light a match just
to break up with me.

509
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,632
Just tell me the truth.

510
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,843
Anne, I was not seeing anyone else.

511
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,463
I really was attacked.

512
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,376
Okay.

513
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,942
- I've got a cut here.
- Okay, I see it now. I'm sorry.

514
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,937
I love you. What are you gonna do?

515
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,198
You don't have to say it back.

516
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,352
Although it wouldn't
break your jaw to try.

517
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,623
You know what the Holy Grail is?

518
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,321
Holy Grail?

519
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,379
Yeah, I know that one. That
was like Jesus' juice glass.

520
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,008
Oh. Yeah, I used to
be such a Catholic.

521
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,788
- Do you still believe in God?
- You gotta believe in God.

522
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,808
But I don't believe that
God made men in his image.

523
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,519
Most of the shit that
happens is because of men.

524
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,022
No, I think man was made
in the devil's image

525
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,233
and women were created out of God.

526
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,903
After all, women have babies,
which is kind of like creating.

527
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,699
And it accounts for the fact that
women are so attracted to men.

528
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,703
Let's face it, the devil is a
hell of a lot more interesting.

529
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,373
I've slept with some saints in my day,
and I know what I'm talking about.

530
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,991
Boring.

531
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,004
So the whole point of life,

532
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,132
I think, is for men and women

533
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:52,413
to get married, so that God and
the devil can get together

534
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,502
and work it out.

535
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,006
Not that we have to get
married or anything.

536
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,811
God forbid.

537
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,898
You have a little thing right here.

538
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,441
What, a pimple?

539
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:09,472
This stuff is supposed to blend
with my skin. Like it works.

540
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:17,028
No, I don't think I'm up
for it tonight, honey.

541
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,616
I just had a very
traumatic experience.

542
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,032
I'm getting sick.

543
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,664
- Ow, ow, ow. Ow.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ow.

544
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,841
Careful, careful, careful now.

545
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,542
Anne, I spent the night
in a boiler room.

546
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm tired.

547
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,003
I'm upset. I don't...

548
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,797
- I'm not in the mood, okay?
- Okay.

549
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,078
Parry?

550
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,706
Parry?

551
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,367
- Oh! Gee.
- Can I help you?

552
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,870
I was looking for Parry.

553
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,069
He's not here.

554
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,418
The hospital said it'd be best if we
kept certain things away from him.

555
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,755
There, that's his real
name. Henry Sagan.

556
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,204
He was a teacher at Hunter College.

557
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,428
They kept him in a mental
place over on Staten Island.

558
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,682
He did not speak for a year, and then
all of a sudden he started talking.

559
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,336
Only now, he's this "Parry" guy.

560
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,272
He and his wife used
to live upstairs.

561
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,391
When he got released,

562
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,519
they sent him here.

563
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,601
I felt bad.

564
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,531
He couldn't work.

565
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,617
Nobody wanted him.

566
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,271
So I let him stay in the basement.

567
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,406
He helped out. I'd give
him a couple of dollars.

568
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,739
People throw things
away, he gets them.

569
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,867
She was a beautiful girl.

570
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,790
He was crazy about her.

571
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,970
<i>I appreciate the way you deal
with people. I'm a big fan.</i>

572
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,098
<i>I enjoy appreciation.</i>

573
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,227
<i>I especially appreciated it when
you told that homeless schmuck...</i>

574
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,772
<i>Who does he think he is, talking
about the money you made?</i>

575
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,940
<i>Yeah, well, I...</i>

576
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,443
<i>Who was he to ask
Jack Lucas anything?</i>

577
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,721
Asshole.

578
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,783
<i>I did the same thing the other day.</i>

579
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,868
<i>It was perfect.</i>

580
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,079
<i>I listen to you every day.</i>

581
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,791
<i>You are a consistent,
integral man. I mean it.</i>

582
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,501
What's the matter, baby?

583
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,324
Can't sleep?

584
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,167
Yeah.

585
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,087
I'll tell you something, Anne.

586
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,003
I really feel cursed.

587
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,293
Stop it.

588
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,018
Things will change.

589
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,514
I feel like I'm a magnet,
but I attract shit.

590
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,066
Out of all the people in this city,

591
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,569
Why'd I meet a man
whose wife I killed?

592
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,099
You didn't kill anybody. Stop it.

593
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,401
I wish there was
some way I could...

594
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,415
just pay the fine and go home.

595
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,923
I know, I know.

596
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,749
Oh, baby.

597
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,774
Have you seen Parry?

598
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,431
...affliction thou
hast made me suffer.

599
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:34,463
Deign, princess, to remember thy slave
who endures misery for love of thee.

600
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,843
- Uh... Parry.
- Hi, Jack.

601
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,905
I thought you could use...

602
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,523
Come on.

603
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,483
Shh.

604
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,626
Oh... Uh... I'm sorry. I...

605
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,449
She'll be back.

606
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,304
Isn't she a vision?

607
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah, gorgeous. I just wanted to...

608
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,088
Come on.

609
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,395
Wait, wait. Hey, look.

610
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,891
I'm leaving. I'm going.
I wanted to give you...

611
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,559
Shit!

612
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,351
Wait.

613
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,437
Now!

614
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,687
Here. Come here!

615
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,582
This way. Down!

616
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,237
Jack.

617
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,955
She buys a new book every two days.

618
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,835
Sweetheart, what
the hell you doing?

619
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,342
She's into trash. But
what are you gonna do?

620
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,982
Jack.

621
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,722
Jack, come here.

622
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,266
Oh.

623
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,784
Oh, she loves dumplings.

624
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,358
That's the Wednesday ritual.

625
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,239
Oh, it's so sweet. She
does that every time.

626
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,416
We're looking through the window.
You got a problem with that?

627
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,467
I'm looking through
the fucking window!

628
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,246
- Jack
- Come on, let's go.

629
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,646
If they said I'd love a girl who chews
jawbreakers, I'd say they were nuts.

630
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,549
But look at that jaw. Oh.

631
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,606
There she goes.

632
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,037
- Oh.
- You follow her every day, huh?

633
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,290
Oh, it's not like that.
I'm deeply smitten.

634
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,709
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

635
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,579
A cooler! Oh.

636
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,215
Oh. This is beautiful. Needs work.

637
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,414
Here. Come here.

638
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,330
I just would like to help you.

639
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,132
Fifty dollars?

640
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,975
All right, here.

641
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,394
Here's another 20. Will that do it?

642
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,513
Seventy dollars?

643
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,267
How much is this gonna take?

644
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,486
You're so nice, I...

645
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,390
- Aw, Jack.
- That's okay.

646
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,441
It's okay.

647
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,912
Hey, can I take you to lunch? Huh?

648
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,281
No, I gotta go back to work.

649
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,569
Take care of yourself.

650
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,431
Sell!

651
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,630
Sell!

652
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,760
Sell!

653
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,263
Buy! Buy!

654
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,318
Buy!

655
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,891
Fuck them all!

656
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,489
What are you doing? Give that back!

657
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,199
Jack! Jack! Jack!

658
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,286
What are you doing? Jack, let go!

659
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,456
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Jack, why did you do that?

660
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,833
- I gave that to you!
- What am I gonna do...?

661
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,961
I don't know, but I gave it to
you to help you, not to help him.

662
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:32,162
Jack, do you really wanna help me?

663
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,436
Okay, you can open your eyes.

664
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,354
Pretty impressive, huh?

665
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,983
As formidable as it seems,
everything has its weakness.

666
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,401
There's no moat.

667
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,113
You can't just break into
Langdon Carmichael's house.

668
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,491
- He's done nothing...
- I'll deal with it!

669
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,534
Let's go through this again, okay?

670
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,162
- Listen to me.
- There is the Holy Grail...

671
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,873
Don't drool or roll your
eyes when I tell you this.

672
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,627
But you shouldn't be doing
this. There is no Holy Grail.

673
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,296
Jack, ye of little faith.

674
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,217
There has to be. What were the
Crusades, the Pope's publicity stunt?

675
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,844
You heathen, there's
a Grail. Come on.

676
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,806
- Hey, hey. Wait, look. Wait a minute.
- Hey! Ha-ha-ha.

677
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,516
You're only partly insane.

678
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,019
People like you can lead
semi-normal lives.

679
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,187
You can get a job.

680
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,387
I have a job, Jack. I have a quest.

681
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,652
I take it back. You're
fucking deranged.

682
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,226
You'll get yourself
killed trying to get in.

683
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,782
That's so sweet.

684
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,535
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to protect me.

685
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,036
You think there's danger.

686
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:47,442
No, I think you're a moron, and
I don't want to get in trouble.

687
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,501
You care.

688
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,294
First the money, now this.

689
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,382
That's so sweet. Oh, you
fabulous guy, you...!

690
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,467
Don't hug me in public again.

691
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,427
"Men with men." Oh, Jack!

692
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,222
I love this guy!

693
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,752
You hear me? I love this guy!

694
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,936
Oh, you hear me, jaded city?

695
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,856
- Will you shut up?
- I love Jack! He cares.

696
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,609
Oh, Jack, in this jaded
motherfucking city, that you...

697
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,819
Shut up!

698
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,489
You hear me? I'm loopy
about this guy. Oh, Jack.

699
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,742
Oh, you're a real human being.

700
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,771
You're a friend. A true friend.

701
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,987
I'm not. Believe me.

702
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,377
- I'm scum.
- Come on.

703
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,880
I won't listen. You're a good guy.

704
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm self-centered. I'm weak.

705
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,260
I don't have the willpower
of a fly on shit.

706
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,638
That's why the little people
sent you. It's magic...

707
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,559
I don't believe in little
floating people, okay?

708
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,803
There is no magic.

709
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,148
But you're still gonna help me.
That's what matters.

710
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,942
Parry. Parry, or
whatever your name is,

711
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,528
you know this isn't true,
the Grail, voices.

712
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,739
Part of you knows it's not true!

713
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,824
We have to start planning now.

714
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,493
- Parry, listen to me!
- Jack, Jack.

715
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,191
You're acting weird.

716
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,581
I know who you are.

717
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,076
- You're an intelligent...
- Jack! Let go!

718
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,419
You used to teach
at Hunter College!

719
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,797
- Parry, you're a teacher! Parry!
- No! No!

720
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,979
Parry!

721
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,007
- Parry!
- Aah!

722
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,518
What are you looking at?

723
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,324
Parry.

724
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,568
Jack.

725
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,325
He's afraid of you.

726
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,084
We've got him! Come on!

727
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,335
Holy shit!

728
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,504
Parry!

729
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,924
Parry!

730
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,426
Parry!

731
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,393
Parry!

732
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,939
Hey! Parry!

733
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,942
We got him, Jack!

734
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,957
Aha!

735
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,795
Parry.

736
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,592
Yes!

737
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,483
Whoa!

738
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,728
We got you!

739
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,913
Aah!

740
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,225
I'm dying.

741
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,769
I can't breathe.

742
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,358
Isn't this a beautiful spot, Jack?

743
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,623
Who have we been chasing?

744
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,822
Can I ask this question now?

745
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,695
He's gone now.

746
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,838
We had him on the run.

747
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,508
If we had horses,
we'd have had his ass.

748
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:07,759
Who?

749
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,377
What?

750
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,431
Who have we been chasing?

751
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,475
Jack, I thought you saw him.

752
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,018
Saw who?

753
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,046
The Red Knight.

754
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,682
Okay.

755
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,194
I gave you the money.

756
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,655
You want to keep it, fine.

757
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,808
You want to give it away, fine.

758
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,370
I just want you to know I did
give him the money, okay?

759
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,318
Are we clear?

760
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,532
Who are you talking to, Jack?

761
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:48,425
Help me! Somebody, please!

762
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,547
Heaven be praised for an opportunity to
fulfill the duties of my profession.

763
00:48:55,141 --> 00:49:00,263
These cries proceed from a miserable
male or female in need of my aid.

764
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,548
This is too hard.

765
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,559
Help me!

766
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:09,821
You lady on the horse,
please trample me!

767
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,566
- Over here!
- What are...?

768
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,578
No, no. Get away from me! Get away!

769
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,122
We're not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!

770
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,333
That's what the other guy
said! Leave me alone!

771
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,668
I want to help you.

772
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,130
No, I want to go.
Please, let me go now!

773
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,592
Scarecrow, they knocked your
stuffing out. Let me help.

774
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:34,095
No, I want a debutante on
a horse to step on me.

775
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,848
- Parry.
- Leave me alone.

776
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,559
Sorry, but the days of
debutantes are over.

777
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,519
Isn't it awful?

778
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,638
Poor little Gloria.

779
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,815
Poor Brenda Frazier.

780
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,152
They ruined them.
They ate them alive!

781
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,654
What about Slim Keith?
That Guggenheim girl?

782
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:55,158
Imposters! Leave me alone.

783
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,534
Jack, lend a hand.

784
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,537
He needs to sleep it off.
Somebody'll take care of him.

785
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,790
Who? Mother Teresa?
She's retired. It's just us.

786
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,418
Maybe he wants to stay.
You want to stay?

787
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,172
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just
love bleeding in horseshit.

788
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,201
How very Gandhi-esque of you.

789
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,427
Jack.

790
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,144
- No, please...
- Doctor!

791
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,898
I was born in a place like this.
I don't want to be here.

792
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,926
- Please, let me...
- Come on.

793
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,488
- Take care of him.
- No, no, no.

794
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,448
I want to go. Please let me go.

795
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,325
Where do you want to go?

796
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,411
A nice place that I know about.

797
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,996
We can go there later.

798
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,332
We can't go there tonight.

799
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,503
- Maybe. Where do you want to go?
- We can't. No, we can't.

800
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,419
Hey, come on.

801
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,429
Where do you want to go?

802
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,682
Venice.

803
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,310
Like Katharine Hepburn
in <i>Summertime.</i>

804
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,931
Why can't I be Katharine Hepburn?

805
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,692
I want to die!

806
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,391
I just want to die!

807
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,572
That's it!

808
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,990
Okay, ready?

809
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,200
I like New York in June

810
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,619
- I'm in the wrong place.
- Aren't we all?

811
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,039
I like a Gershwin tune

812
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,958
Don't hold back. Okay!

813
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,043
I like to read good books

814
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,547
Where will I put the children?
Goddamn daughter-in-law.

815
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,757
Comes in looking for dust balls.

816
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,428
Get the fuck out of my
dining room, you asshole!

817
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,888
Wonderful feeling, but
you're stretching.

818
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,017
Come on, tempo. Allegro,
people, allegro.

819
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,893
- Okay.
- Ahem. When you, um...

820
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,262
I like New York in June

821
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,941
Did you lose your
mind all of a sudden,

822
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,221
or was it a slow, gradual process?

823
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,517
Well...

824
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,149
I'm a singer by trade.

825
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,497
Summer stock, nightclub
revues, that sort of thing.

826
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,027
And God, I absolutely lived for it.

827
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,297
I can do <i>Gypsy,</i> every
part. I can do it backwards.

828
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,300
Then one night, in the
middle of singing "Funny,"

829
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,302
suddenly it hit me.

830
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,922
What does all this mean?

831
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:26,927
I mean, that, plus the fact that
I'd watched all my friends die.

832
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,315
Sound like a veteran,
don't I? Heh, heh.

833
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,525
- Fuck off!
- My dad would be so proud of me.

834
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,152
Hey.

835
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,931
- Pizza!
- About time.

836
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,662
Never gonna find her in this crowd.

837
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,099
She's like clockwork. She comes
here at the same time every day.

838
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,968
She's late.

839
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,094
Thank you.

840
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,735
Parry. Parry.

841
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,935
Did you hear Jimmy Nickels
got picked up yesterday?

842
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,119
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

843
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,913
He got caught pissing
on a bookstore.

844
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,748
Man's a pig.

845
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,868
No excuse for that.
Thank you, babe.

846
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:38,040
We're heading for social anarchy
when people piss on bookstores.

847
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,914
Asshole.

848
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,970
Didn't even look at you.

849
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,841
Well, he's paying so
he don't have to look.

850
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,186
See, guy goes to work every day,

851
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,355
eight hours a day,
seven days a week.

852
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,441
Gets his nuts so tight in a vice,

853
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:00,767
he starts questioning the
very fabric of his existence.

854
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,281
Then one day, about quitting time,

855
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,783
boss calls him in the
office and says,

856
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:10,360
"Hey, Bob, why don't you come
in here and kiss my ass for me?"

857
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,666
Well, he says, "Hell with it.

858
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,990
I don't care what happens.

859
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,839
I just want to see the
expression on his face

860
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,289
as I jam this pair of
scissors into his arm."

861
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,672
Then he thinks of me.

862
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,974
He says, "Wait a minute.

863
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,518
I got both my arms.
I got both my legs.

864
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,388
At least I'm not
begging for a living."

865
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:40,928
Sure enough, Bob's gonna put those
scissors down and pucker right up.

866
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,190
See, I'm what you call kind of
a moral traffic light, really.

867
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,868
I'm like saying, "Red.
Go no further.

868
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,443
Boop! Boop, boop, boop..."

869
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:16,007
I do not need this.

870
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,919
A woman my age.

871
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,522
I'm a person. There's a
person here. This is kid stuff!

872
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,473
You come, you go. All I
do is cook, like a jerk!

873
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,364
You waste a good lasagna.

874
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,740
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

875
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,065
I don't need this. Find
yourself another dope.

876
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,693
Son of a bitch.

877
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,682
God, what a beautiful night, Jack.

878
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,177
Don't you think it's
time to go now?

879
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,104
Running around in the day is okay,

880
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,399
but at night, we could be
killed by a variety of people.

881
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,723
That's stupid, Jack.

882
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,405
This park is mine as
much as it is theirs.

883
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,782
Is it fair that they
can keep us out?

884
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,201
To make us think we
might get killed?

885
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,245
- I think it's very fair.
- I don't.

886
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:23,207
- What are you doing?
- I'm cloud-busting. You ever done it?

887
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:27,753
Lie back, concentrate on the clouds
and break them apart with your mind.

888
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,715
- But you have to be nude.
- You can't do this.

889
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,092
No one's allowed to be naked

890
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,261
in a field in New York.
It's too Midwestern.

891
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,097
Come on, Jack. It's wild!
It's really freeing!

892
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,267
Your nipples are hard, little
guy's dangling in the wind.

893
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,394
- Come on.
- What are you afraid of?

894
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,854
You're pissing me off.

895
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,189
We're bare-assed naked
in the middle of it!

896
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,442
I'm not doing this. This is nuts!

897
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,694
- I'm leaving.
- Free yourself!

898
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,655
You know why dogs do this?
Yow! It feels good!

899
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,073
I'm not doing that.

900
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,771
Yes, yo!

901
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,286
- I'm leaving.
- Come on.

902
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,455
Get back to your roots.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

903
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,500
The man talks to invisible people,
he sees invisible horses,

904
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,253
and he's lying naked in the
middle of Central Park.

905
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,339
I'm not surprised, I'm out
of my mind to be here!

906
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,458
Who are you talking to?

907
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,803
I'm talking to the little people!

908
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,263
Are they here?

909
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,308
They're saying, "Jack,
go to the liquor store,

910
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:26,395
findeth the Jack of Daniels
that ye may be shitfaced!

911
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,147
Doolang, doolang!"

912
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,674
They said that?

913
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,443
You are out of your fucking mind!

914
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,236
Bingo!

915
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,240
Come on. Free up the little guy.
Let him flap in the breeze.

916
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,994
Oh, Jack.

917
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,707
Nothing's happening.

918
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,167
Concentrate.

919
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,544
What if some homophobic
jogger runs by

920
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,214
and kills us to get
back at his father?

921
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,802
"Jack Lucas, found dead
next to a dead, naked man.

922
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,673
The two were dead. His
companion was naked."

923
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,352
I hate it when they use the word
"companion." It's so insinuating.

924
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,271
Probably boost the
sales of my biography.

925
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,774
The public has a fascination
with celebrity murders

926
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,692
that involve nakedness. Bastards.

927
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,362
Jack, I may be going
out on a limb here,

928
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,607
but you don't seem
like a happy camper.

929
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,697
Did you ever hear the
story of the Fisher King?

930
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,570
No.

931
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,754
Begins with the king as a
boy having to sleep alone

932
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,750
in the forest to prove his
courage so he can become king.

933
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,296
While he's spending
the night alone,

934
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,682
he's visited by a sacred vision.

935
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:48,428
Out of the fire appears
the Holy Grail,

936
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,722
symbol of God's divine grace.

937
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,860
A voice said to the boy, "You
shall be keeper of the Grail

938
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,014
so that it may heal
the hearts of men."

939
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,200
But the boy was blinded by
greater visions of a life

940
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,150
filled with power and
glory and beauty.

941
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,908
And in this state of
radical amazement,

942
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:14,450
he felt for a brief
moment, not like a boy,

943
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,948
but invincible.

944
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,799
Like God.

945
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,374
So he reached in the
fire to take the Grail,

946
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,877
and the Grail vanished,

947
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:29,462
leaving him with his hand in the
fire to be terribly wounded.

948
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,218
Now, as this boy grew older,

949
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,009
his wound grew deeper.

950
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,644
Until one day,

951
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,768
life for him lost its reason.

952
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,944
He had no faith in any
men, not even himself.

953
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,237
He couldn't love

954
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:52,192
or feel loved. He was
sick with experience.

955
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,001
He began to die.

956
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,964
One day, a fool wandered
into the castle

957
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,958
and found the king alone.

958
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,180
And being a fool, he was
simple-minded. He didn't see a king.

959
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,307
He only saw a man alone

960
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,130
and in pain.

961
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,676
And he asked the king,
"What ails you, friend?"

962
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,731
And the king replied,

963
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,932
"I'm thirsty. I need some
water to cool my throat."

964
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:26,602
So the fool took a cup from beside
his bed, filled it with water

965
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,103
and handed it to the king.

966
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,664
And as the king began to drink,

967
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,944
he realized his wound was healed.

968
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,878
He looked and there
was the Holy Grail,

969
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,214
that which he sought
all of his life.

970
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,216
He turned to the fool and said,

971
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:46,838
"How could you find that which my
brightest and bravest could not?"

972
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,181
The fool replied,

973
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,209
"I don't know.

974
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,758
I only knew that you were thirsty."

975
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,684
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

976
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:08,727
I think I heard that at a
lecture once. I don't know.

977
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,941
Some professor...

978
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,698
Heh, heh. At Hunt...

979
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,832
You all right?

980
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,955
Hunt...

981
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,415
Parry.

982
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,670
Hey. Parry.

983
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,848
- Jack.
- Hey.

984
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,391
How come you never ask
that girl for a date?

985
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,697
I can't ask, I have to earn her.

986
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:50,951
Come on, this is the 20th century.
You don't have to earn a woman.

987
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,162
Maybe after we get the Grail.

988
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,622
But she could help
you get the Grail.

989
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,834
You know, I mean, women are great.

990
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,210
They make homes,

991
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,963
and they kill the livestock

992
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,507
so the knights can go
out and get Grails.

993
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,801
Slaughter villages
with a clear head.

994
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:11,305
Where would King Arthur
be without Guinevere?

995
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,674
Happily married, probably.

996
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,186
Well, that's a bad example.
But trust me on this.

997
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,607
A woman who loves you keeps
you going, gives you strength.

998
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,276
Makes you feel like
you can do anything.

999
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,146
Is that what your
girlfriend does for you?

1000
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,316
Sure, yeah.

1001
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,619
Hm?

1002
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,321
Get out of the fucking way!

1003
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,753
Yes. Two Hearts Publishing?

1004
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,672
May I speak to Lydia, please?

1005
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,602
Lydia? Who is Lydia?

1006
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,521
I don't know her last name.

1007
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,275
You are calling Lydia
from my apartment?

1008
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,569
- You must think I'm some dope.
- No, no.

1009
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,446
You son of a bitch!

1010
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,574
- Her name is Lydia!
- You stay out all night long.

1011
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,826
- You stroll in here at noon.
- Hey!

1012
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,953
- You think I need this? I don't.
- Lydia!

1013
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,231
- No, no, no.
- Oh, shit!

1014
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:05,002
I was not with a woman last
night. I was out with Parry!

1015
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,620
The moron?

1016
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,118
He's not a moron.

1017
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,453
Who's Lydia?

1018
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:14,167
Lydia is the girl that Parry likes.

1019
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,252
I thought...

1020
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,585
- What?
- You wouldn't understand.

1021
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:25,105
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
That pisses me off.

1022
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,192
I'm sorry. I feel indebted
to the guy, okay?

1023
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,443
What's that mean?

1024
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,112
- There, you see?
- What does it mean?

1025
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:36,200
I thought that if I could
help him in some way

1026
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,203
get him this girl that he loves

1027
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,246
that maybe, you know,

1028
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,570
things would change for me.

1029
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,875
Forget it. It's a
dumb fucking idea.

1030
01:06:55,929 --> 01:07:00,505
You big galoot.
You are such a mess.

1031
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,855
Well, listen.

1032
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,639
Stranger things

1033
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,559
have been known

1034
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,691
to happen.

1035
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,284
<i>I've got the power</i>

1036
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,966
Hello? Hello?

1037
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,303
Who is this?

1038
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,581
Hello, Lydia.

1039
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,977
This is Jack Lucas. I'm calling
from Video Spot Video Rentals.

1040
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:49,022
Lydia, you are a major
credit-card holder, are you not?

1041
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:53,428
Lydia, Lydia, I've got
some good news for you.

1042
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,447
<i>Of several credit-card holders, in
conjunction with several companies...</i>

1043
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:01,034
- Which ones? Which ones?
<i>- All of them.</i>

1044
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:05,247
Which means that you have just won
a free membership at our store.

1045
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,325
How did this happen?

1046
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,047
My name was...?

1047
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,176
Is my name on a list?

1048
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,513
- Did you pick it out of a hat?
- It was a list.

1049
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,308
Were a lot of people
there? Or just you?

1050
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,586
There were, uh...

1051
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,521
What's the difference?

1052
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,357
This phone... I've never
won anything in my life.

1053
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,860
And I don't even have a VCR...

1054
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,654
You'll get a free VCR
with a membership...

1055
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,990
For a short time, until
you get your own.

1056
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,076
Why don't you come on
down to the store,

1057
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,162
<i>check it out, see if
you're interested?</i>

1058
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:48,540
No. Did Phyllis tell
you to call me and...?

1059
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,251
Did Phyllis in Accounting do that?

1060
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:54,338
No, I told you, you won a contest.

1061
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,457
<i>You have just...</i>

1062
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,706
This is gonna be rough.

1063
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,298
This is gonna be rough.

1064
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,897
Shh, Shh, Shh.

1065
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,300
Well, I need to warm up.

1066
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:18,726
I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh.
I can't find my baby.

1067
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,074
I knew I could make you smile.

1068
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:28,163
Look, one chorus and then
you're out of there.

1069
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,783
Jack, I'm a man with a mission.

1070
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:35,572
I can't believe I'm on a first-name
basis with these people.

1071
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,925
Can I help you?

1072
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,511
Is a mousy little woman
named Lydia here?

1073
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,137
Yes. If you wait, I'll get...

1074
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,764
No. It's a personal message.

1075
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,214
- I have to give it to her in person.
- You can't go back there!

1076
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,388
Lydia Sinclair?

1077
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,029
You must be she.

1078
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,800
I had a dream

1079
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:25,971
A dream for guess who, Lydia

1080
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,726
It wasn't for her, Lydia

1081
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:38,636
It's only for you, yes, Lydia

1082
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,654
Some people can get their kicks

1083
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:46,158
Watching Koppel
And late-night flicks

1084
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:53,498
That's okay for some people
Who don't own VCRs

1085
01:10:53,499 --> 01:11:00,172
But, Lydia
You've won our grand prize

1086
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,717
Just think of it, all the movies
You'll watch for free now

1087
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,844
Dramas, Westerns, Comedies, wow

1088
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,138
Video Spot has
The best selection

1089
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,850
If you like porno
We're your connection

1090
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:16,897
And everything's
Coming up videos

1091
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:20,650
Everything's coming up videos

1092
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:24,404
This time for free

1093
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,490
For you, Lydia

1094
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:36,291
For free

1095
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,239
Ow!

1096
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,539
Our card.

1097
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,273
It'll be like you work here.

1098
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,567
What am I qualified to do?

1099
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,944
Sort, you know.

1100
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,861
Jack. Jack.

1101
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,916
Yeah, this'll be good.

1102
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,319
You'll smell like a forest.

1103
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,443
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.

1104
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:47,904
Oh, hi. How you doing?

1105
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,782
Congratulations. Jack Lucas.
Nice to finally meet you.

1106
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,159
This is Anne Napolitano.
Video Spot owner.

1107
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,995
Hello. Congratulations.

1108
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,649
And this is our coworker,

1109
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,499
Parry. Parry...

1110
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,322
Parry Parry?

1111
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,211
No, just Parry.

1112
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,115
Oh. Like Moses.

1113
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,846
How do we do this?

1114
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:17,350
Well, first we'll have you sign out
an official membership card there.

1115
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:21,847
Sign that, if you would, and we'll
have that laminated for you.

1116
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,441
Would you like to laminate
Miss Sinclair's card?

1117
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,901
Oh, yeah.

1118
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,777
This will last you for a year,

1119
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,948
after which you can renew, if you
wish, at a membership discount.

1120
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,159
Yeah, but not for free, right?

1121
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,493
Yeah.

1122
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:39,239
- You get 10 videos.
- Free?

1123
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,207
- Free.
- Only the first 10.

1124
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,578
After that, they're 2.99 a rental.

1125
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,658
Jack. Jack.

1126
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,426
All right, all right. Go on.

1127
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,919
Go on.

1128
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,688
- Can I help you?
- No, no. I can look myself.

1129
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,466
Okay.

1130
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,704
<i>Hell Merchants.</i> Good choice.

1131
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,528
I don't like horror movies.

1132
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,077
How about, uh...

1133
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,255
<i>The Purple Bread?</i>

1134
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:33,286
It's a big new Speizak's
film. Let's see.

1135
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:38,390
It's set against a sweeping
background of a polish bakery.

1136
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:42,435
Polish. That's a Polish bakery.
That's why it's in subtitles.

1137
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,647
Don't like love...
Polish love stories.

1138
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,941
- I like musicals.
- Musicals.

1139
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,235
Musicals?

1140
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,861
Over here.

1141
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:54,230
Here's our entertainment center.

1142
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,908
Here's Fred Astaire. That's good.

1143
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,077
Yeah, Jolson. <i>Mammy.</i>

1144
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,080
- Have you got any Ethel Merman?
- Ethel Merman?

1145
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,733
She's...

1146
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,661
<i>Ethel Merman?</i>

1147
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,966
We're all out of Ethel Merman.

1148
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,428
- Ah...! What a gyp!
- That sucks.

1149
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,974
I think I actually ordered
some just the other day.

1150
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,877
Did you or didn't you?

1151
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,462
Yeah. They'll be in soon.

1152
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,344
Well...

1153
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,568
I'll come back then.

1154
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,986
Oh, uh...

1155
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:36,357
Miss Sinclair, your card.
Don't forget it.

1156
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,603
I like your nails.

1157
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,455
Where'd you get them done?

1158
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,956
Actually, I...

1159
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:48,657
I do them myself. I used to
work in a beauty parlor.

1160
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,463
- I like the stars.
- You know,

1161
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:55,175
Anne does other people.
Sort of as a sideline.

1162
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,328
She could do your nails.

1163
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,705
How much?

1164
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,754
- Well, you're a member. We could...
- Forty dollars.

1165
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,423
Forty dollars?

1166
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,592
Forty?

1167
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,103
Forty. For... Um...

1168
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,362
Okay.

1169
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,122
- When will you do them?
- I don't know. Next...

1170
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,866
Tonight?

1171
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,919
Tonight.

1172
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,742
Tonight.

1173
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,328
Tonight.

1174
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,468
Thank you.

1175
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,357
Jack, getting your nails
done is one thing,

1176
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,027
but going out to dinner with
strangers, and that one...

1177
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:59,114
- We'll make it very casual.
- She didn't look at him.

1178
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,448
It won't be a date.

1179
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,318
You got any more starchy food?

1180
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,406
Oh, clumsy <i>moi.</i>

1181
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,661
Thank you.

1182
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,555
I've gone out with some bums,
but they were beautiful.

1183
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,254
That's the only reason
to go out with a bum.

1184
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:29,352
This food is delicious,
Anne. Really.

1185
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:33,189
You're a wonderful cook, and you
have a great set of dishes.

1186
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,568
Jack, he's trying to
start a conversation.

1187
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,813
Well, talk, then. He's
not gonna bite you.

1188
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,489
Thank you.

1189
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,408
You're welcome.

1190
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:44,576
You know,

1191
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:48,204
you are a beautiful woman.
You got your own business.

1192
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:52,500
I am surprised some guy doesn't
just snatch you up all for his own.

1193
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,619
Oh, you're surprised?

1194
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,298
Guess I never met the right guy.
What are you gonna do?

1195
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,759
No. I'm shocked.

1196
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,096
I mean, a childbearing
body like yours...

1197
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,057
A guy would have to
be out of his mind.

1198
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,256
Most guys are.

1199
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,506
No.

1200
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,064
You?

1201
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,860
This incredible woman going
to waste before my very eyes.

1202
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,905
No, this is outrageous!

1203
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,657
I will not hear this.
No! No, come on.

1204
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,660
- Jack, get over here.
- I am your man, then!

1205
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,954
Let's do it right here!

1206
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,749
Let's go to that place of
splendor in the grass!

1207
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,586
Behold my magic wand and free
your golden orbs right now!

1208
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,504
You know what I'm saying.

1209
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:40,465
What are you? Out of your mind?

1210
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:43,301
What a wonderful way
Of saying how much you...

1211
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,970
- Close your pants.
- Took you long enough.

1212
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,847
What are you, a 40 in a jacket?

1213
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,557
Yeah, that's it.

1214
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,585
This is gonna work.

1215
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,932
You let me know, because you're
too good a woman to go to waste.

1216
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,676
Oh.

1217
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,344
Welcome.

1218
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,042
Come in.

1219
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,352
I've never been in an apartment
above a store before.

1220
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:37,230
You always walk past
them on the street,

1221
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,760
but you never really think
anyone lives in them.

1222
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:51,077
Can I get you something?
A little coffee?

1223
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:54,948
- A little tea? A little tequila?
- No. Nope.

1224
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,969
Will it hurt?

1225
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,589
That all depends on you.

1226
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,879
You sure you don't want a drink?

1227
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,184
Yes.

1228
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,384
You just enjoy this. Thattaboy.

1229
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:21,274
- This is mud.
- We just washed that off.

1230
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,928
This is gonna make you look great.

1231
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,029
It's good mud. Heh.

1232
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,489
- Shh.
- Shh.

1233
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,608
- Close.
- Mm-hm.

1234
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,485
- Lips.
- Mm.

1235
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,331
Heh. Jack.

1236
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,749
Close.

1237
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,197
What are you doing?

1238
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,784
There we go.

1239
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:46,121
Now, you just relax.

1240
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,838
So anybody special in your life?

1241
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:54,292
Does it look like there's
anybody special in my life?

1242
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,560
You don't have to say it like that.

1243
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,897
It's not so, you
know, crazy an idea.

1244
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:04,275
You're healthy. You have a steady
job. You're not cross-eyed.

1245
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,903
Nope, there is nobody special.

1246
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,851
Okay, fine.

1247
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,869
I mean, it's not easy
in this day and age.

1248
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,897
What's not easy?

1249
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,125
- Meeting people.
- Oh, God. Tell me about it.

1250
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,836
I've been dating longer
than I've been driving.

1251
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,955
I can't believe that.

1252
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:32,539
I have never been
through a dating period.

1253
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,431
It's a disgusting process.

1254
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,005
You haven't missed a thing.

1255
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:39,936
Hold still.

1256
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,729
I'm so excited.

1257
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,651
Did you feel like this
when you first met Anne?

1258
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,654
She's a wonderful woman.
She loves you too much.

1259
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,353
But you love her too, don't you?

1260
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,325
I mean, you know you do.

1261
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,994
It's just that you're
an asshole sometimes.

1262
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,612
Sorry.

1263
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,780
Thanks.

1264
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,923
My mother calls me once a week,
like an ongoing nightmare.

1265
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,134
"Have you met anyone?" "No, Mom."

1266
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,886
"What's going to happen?"
"I don't know, Mom."

1267
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,556
Thank God I moved
out of that house!

1268
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:19,684
I cannot believe you lived
with her as long as you did.

1269
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:23,840
If I had to live with my mother,
I would stab myself six times.

1270
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,852
I think some people are
meant to be alone.

1271
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,155
This is my idea:

1272
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:35,116
That I was born a
man in a former life,

1273
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,077
and I used women for pleasure.

1274
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,900
So now...

1275
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,949
I'm paying for it.

1276
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,002
I wouldn't mind so much if I could

1277
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,656
just remember the pleasure parts.

1278
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,592
I think you're getting a
little too complicated.

1279
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:54,510
What, in your opinion,

1280
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,846
is the actual problem?

1281
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,716
I don't make an
impression on people.

1282
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:05,104
At office parties,
I rearrange the hors d'oeuvres

1283
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:09,567
while people are eating them,
so that the platters will remain full.

1284
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:14,314
I never start any of the conversations,
because I just don't know...

1285
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:19,202
I don't know where to
make it end, to go.

1286
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:24,165
Listen, listen. You gotta be a
little easier on yourself, doll.

1287
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,875
A conversation

1288
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,169
has a life of its own, you know?

1289
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,838
You have to have some
faith in that fact.

1290
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,037
I mean, look at us.

1291
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,168
We're having

1292
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:39,096
a very lovely conversation.

1293
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,723
I'm paying you.

1294
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:45,311
Will you stop it? I'm not like that.
I don't do people favors.

1295
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,772
If I talk to you, it's
because I want to.

1296
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:51,052
You're not a supermodel.
We can't all be Jerry Hall.

1297
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:54,237
What a boring world it'd be
if we were all Jerry Hall.

1298
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,739
You do the best you can
with what you got.

1299
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,950
You're not so invisible.

1300
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,285
Hey, you want a personality?

1301
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,329
Try this on for size:

1302
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,483
You can be a real bitch.

1303
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:17,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

1304
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,682
Really?

1305
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,525
I'm gonna give you my wallet

1306
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,485
so you can pay for dinner.

1307
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:37,730
You're a nice man, Jack,
doing all this for me.

1308
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,576
- I'm scared.
- No, no, no.

1309
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,828
I mean, I feel so much for her.

1310
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,122
I feel like something
awful is gonna happen.

1311
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,874
Nothing awful is gonna
happen. No, no, no.

1312
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,502
Anne is gonna be there.
I'm gonna be there.

1313
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,672
Nothing awful is gonna
happen. Okay?

1314
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:55,881
I'm still scared.

1315
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,592
I know. It's gonna be fine.

1316
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,594
Okay. All right.

1317
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,123
- You're looking good.
- You too.

1318
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,849
- Just remember to breathe.
- I gotta breathe.

1319
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,843
Big breaths.

1320
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:14,859
Anne? Anne? Anne?

1321
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,611
Oh. Oh, oh.

1322
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,904
- Aah!
- Hey, look! Lydia, how you doing?

1323
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:22,199
Parry, look. It's Lydia Sinclair,
our membership winner.

1324
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,576
I know.

1325
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,536
What have you fellas been up to?

1326
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,372
Everything's locked up. We
thought we'd get some dinner.

1327
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,749
Oh.

1328
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,209
- Parry!
- Ja... Ow! Jack.

1329
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:36,047
Say, anybody up for Chinese?

1330
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,633
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Would you like to join us?

1331
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:39,884
No, thank you.

1332
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,637
- Watch your nails.
- I'd rather go home.

1333
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,723
- Me too.
- Parry, Parry, Parry. Come on.

1334
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,601
- You still have to eat.
- No, I'd like to...

1335
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,479
Don't blow this. Hey...

1336
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,554
- I'd rather go home.
- What'd I tell you? It's only dinner.

1337
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,942
Come on. You're gonna do this.

1338
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,570
You'll have something
to tell your mother.

1339
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,190
You are coming!

1340
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,526
Fine.

1341
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,783
What do you do?

1342
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,836
Well, I get to read
the book sometimes.

1343
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:19,048
But mostly, I calculate
production costs,

1344
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:25,221
Calculation costs

1345
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:28,891
from first-edition hardcover
to, sorry, softcover.

1346
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,019
And after softcover,
it's somebody else's problem.

1347
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,271
Boy, that sounds real exciting.

1348
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,316
Why does it sound exciting?
It's not exciting at all.

1349
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,859
Why not?

1350
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:44,615
Your calculations determine whether
a book is published or not.

1351
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:48,369
You know, maybe it's a book that
changes the way people think

1352
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,037
or, you know, act.

1353
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:54,375
Yeah, but what we publish is
mostly trashy romance novels.

1354
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,876
Don't say that.

1355
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,700
There's nothing
trashy about romance.

1356
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,751
In romance is passion.

1357
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:07,877
There's imagination.
There's beauty.

1358
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,593
Besides, you find

1359
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,395
some pretty wonderful
things in the trash.

1360
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,492
Ooh, dumplings.

1361
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,021
I could eat all of these.

1362
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,399
Would you like a dumpling?

1363
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:38,327
- Some tea?
- Yes, please.

1364
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,627
There you go.

1365
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,081
Parry.

1366
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,690
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1367
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,219
Ooh, boy. Heh, heh, sorry.

1368
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:05,392
Oh. Hey.

1369
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,400
Sorry.

1370
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,662
- It's hot.
- Whew.

1371
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,047
Help her with that.

1372
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,185
Thanks.

1373
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,400
Excuse me.

1374
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,280
Excuse me.

1375
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:03,087
- It's contagious.
- What do you think?

1376
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:06,162
- Ha!
- It's good stuff, huh?

1377
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,912
I think that they were
made for each other.

1378
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,248
Scary, but true.

1379
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,917
You got it?

1380
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,837
You got it? I got it. You got it.

1381
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,427
There it is. Okay.

1382
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,528
Yay!

1383
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,381
Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia?

1384
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,884
Lydia the tattooed lady

1385
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:52,553
She has eyes
That men adore so

1386
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:55,389
And a torso even more so

1387
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,392
Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia?

1388
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,978
Lydia the queen of tattoos

1389
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:04,315
On her back is
The Battle of Waterloo

1390
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:07,192
Beside it
The wreck of the <i>Hesperus</i> too

1391
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:10,905
And proudly above
Waves the red, white and blue

1392
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:14,533
You can learn a lot from Lydia

1393
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,918
When her robe is unfurled
She will show you the world

1394
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,545
If you step up
And tell her where

1395
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,673
For a dime you can see
Kankakee or Paris

1396
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,426
Or Washington crossing
The Delaware

1397
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:42,519
Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia?

1398
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,939
Lydia the tattooed lady

1399
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,900
When her muscles start relaxin'

1400
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:51,153
Up the hill
Comes Michael Jackson

1401
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:54,281
<i>Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia?</i>

1402
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,950
No, come on, come on.

1403
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,230
Did you see her with the noodles?

1404
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:04,158
She had a noodle
hanging down her head!

1405
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,503
I couldn't believe it!

1406
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,717
Then they started in
on the dumplings.

1407
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,053
Playing hockey with
it on the table...

1408
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,389
It was broccoli!

1409
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,224
- No, it was a dumpling.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1410
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:23,378
They were batting it
around with chopsticks.

1411
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,052
- Stop. I'm gonna lose it.
- Wait, the burping...

1412
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,611
Yo, Lydia!

1413
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,389
Watch out! Hey.

1414
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:41,328
Tell me more about yourself.
I'd like to know everything.

1415
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,455
There's nothing more to tell.

1416
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:44,999
Oh, don't say that.

1417
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,710
- No, that's it.
- It's enough for me.

1418
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,129
- I think she went for him.
- I know.

1419
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,339
I can't believe I did it.

1420
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,176
What?

1421
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,954
It's Latin.

1422
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,669
It means "love conquers all."

1423
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,641
I don't mean us.

1424
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,840
I mean everybody else.

1425
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:10,024
- Do you think it'll work out?
- Who knows? Who knows?

1426
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:14,111
Two people could be across from each
other and never find each other.

1427
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:17,448
Another two people could be on
opposite sides of the world

1428
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,950
and nothing could keep them apart.

1429
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,577
Who knows?

1430
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:25,278
The thing is, if a thing
is meant to happen...

1431
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,172
- What?
- Nothing. Go on.

1432
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,041
Wait a minute.

1433
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,207
You must be very proud of yourself.

1434
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,930
You did a great thing
for somebody tonight.

1435
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,803
I was very proud to
be with you tonight.

1436
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,140
You were great.

1437
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,055
Thank you.

1438
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,240
You're welcome.

1439
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,132
Steamed dumplings.

1440
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,719
Moo Shu pork!

1441
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,807
You don't have to say that.

1442
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,892
I never say anything I have to.

1443
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:30,763
No, I mean you don't have
to say nice things to me.

1444
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,982
It's old-fashioned, considering
what we're about to do.

1445
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,693
- What are we about to do?
- You're walking me home.

1446
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,437
Mm-hm.

1447
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:41,698
I think you're a little
attracted to me.

1448
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,476
Yeah.

1449
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:51,375
And you'll probably want to
come upstairs for some coffee.

1450
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,876
I don't drink coffee.

1451
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,254
Then we'll probably have a drink.

1452
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:58,132
And talk and get to know each other

1453
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,706
a little bit better,
get comfortable.

1454
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,666
And then you'll...

1455
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,586
You'll sleep over.

1456
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,719
And in the morning, you'll awake,

1457
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,434
and you'll be distant.

1458
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:20,601
And you won't be able
to stay for breakfast.

1459
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:22,948
Maybe just a cup of coffee.

1460
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,783
I don't drink coffee.

1461
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,618
And then

1462
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:29,192
we'll exchange phone numbers.

1463
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,448
And you'll leave...

1464
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,616
and never call.

1465
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:39,882
And I'll go to work
and I'll feel so good

1466
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:42,968
for the first hour, and then,

1467
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:47,294
ever so slowly, I'll turn
into a piece of dirt.

1468
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,887
I don't know why I'm putting
myself through this.

1469
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,391
It was really nice to meet you.

1470
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,190
Good night.

1471
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,279
Good night.

1472
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:14,875
Excuse me! Wait, just...

1473
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:17,544
Hey! Sorry. Wait one minute.

1474
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,413
Excuse me. Please wait.

1475
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,633
- I'm not feeling very well.
- Well, no wonder.

1476
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,970
We just met, made love and broke
up, all in the space of 30 seconds.

1477
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:30,349
I don't remember the first kiss,
which I think is the best part.

1478
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,601
It was so very special to meet you.

1479
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:36,563
It was for me too, but I think
it's time you should shut up now.

1480
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,065
Shut up.

1481
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,638
Please?

1482
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:47,741
I'm not coming up to your apartment.
That was never my intention.

1483
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,117
Oh.

1484
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:52,112
- You don't want to.
- Oh, no, I want to.

1485
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,696
I have a hard-on for you
the size of Florida.

1486
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,657
But I don't want just one night.

1487
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,549
I have a confession I
have to make to you.

1488
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:07,719
- You're married? You're divorced?
- No, no.

1489
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,464
- You have a disease?
- No, please stop.

1490
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:15,920
I'm in love with you.

1491
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,345
Shh.

1492
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,735
And not just from tonight.

1493
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,559
I've known you for a long time.

1494
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:32,202
I know that you come out from work
and fight your way out that door.

1495
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:35,372
You get pushed back in, and
then you come back out.

1496
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,292
I walk with you to lunch.
It's a good day

1497
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,663
if you stop and get that
romance novel at that stall.

1498
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:45,173
I know on Wednesdays, you
go to that dim sum parlor.

1499
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:50,125
And I know that you get a jawbreaker
before you go back into work.

1500
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:55,968
And I know you hate your job and
you don't have many friends.

1501
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,729
Sometimes you feel uncoordinated

1502
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:02,225
and you don't feel as
wonderful as everybody else.

1503
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:06,387
Feeling as alone and separate
as you feel you are...

1504
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,315
I love you.

1505
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,945
I love you.

1506
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:19,207
I think you're the greatest
thing since spice racks.

1507
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,669
I'd be knocked out if I could
just have that first kiss.

1508
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,380
And I won't be distant.

1509
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:29,331
I'll come back in the morning.
I'll call you, if you'll let me.

1510
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,714
But I still don't drink coffee.

1511
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,544
Shh.

1512
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,900
You're real...

1513
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,566
aren't you?

1514
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:10,205
Bye.

1515
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,703
It's the wrong door.

1516
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:18,967
You can call me.

1517
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,467
She didn't give me the number.

1518
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:18,436
No! No!

1519
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:21,985
Please, let me have this.

1520
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,956
Let me have it!

1521
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,163
Where are you?!

1522
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,987
Where are you?!

1523
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,170
We're tired of looking
at you people!

1524
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:02,782
Thank you.

1525
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,875
Ha, ha. Yeah, well,
I'm feeling good.

1526
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:14,370
I don't know how
else to put it, Lou.

1527
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:19,215
Yeah, well, I had those
personal problems to work out.

1528
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:22,385
And I have, and now I
wanna get back to work.

1529
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:24,584
Do you think that's possible?

1530
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,338
Yeah, I understand.

1531
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:31,970
I am, yeah.

1532
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:35,224
I won't.

1533
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,344
I will.

1534
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,565
Great. When?

1535
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,785
Tuesday's fine.

1536
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:49,621
Tuesday's great, Lou.
I'll see you then.

1537
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:52,366
Thanks a lot. Okay, bye.

1538
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,418
- Who's Lou?
- Lou is my agent.

1539
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,504
- You're kidding.
- I called my agent.

1540
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:59,547
What did he say?

1541
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:03,134
He says that if I want to get
back to work, no problem.

1542
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,458
That I just come in

1543
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,431
and we talk and that's it.

1544
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:10,433
Oh, baby!

1545
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:12,185
That's terrific!

1546
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:15,146
I gotta get these tapes
organized. You seen my jacket?

1547
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,773
It's in the bathroom.

1548
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:19,693
The bathroom... I got
coffee here if you want.

1549
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:21,569
You made coffee?

1550
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:25,365
You are going back to
work and you made coffee?

1551
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:27,564
I'm loving this.

1552
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,615
Oh, you know what would be neat?

1553
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:37,127
Now that there's gonna be
another income coming in,

1554
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,421
I'd love to look for
a bigger place.

1555
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:42,006
I mean, I don't want
to rush anything,

1556
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:44,926
but I'd like to start
looking anyway, you know?

1557
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,553
Maybe a two-bedroom

1558
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:49,753
or maybe even the
top floor of a house?

1559
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:52,142
Say, in Brooklyn...

1560
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,643
Heights?

1561
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,897
What?

1562
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:00,984
You don't wanna commute, right?
That's all right. We could...

1563
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,807
Come here.

1564
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:06,448
You are an incredible woman.

1565
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:09,993
I'm an incredible woman?
What's this, a death sentence?

1566
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:13,238
No, no, I want to talk about this.

1567
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,776
So much has happened

1568
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:20,920
that I think it would be a
good thing for both of us

1569
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,039
if we...

1570
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:25,925
slowed down a little.

1571
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:28,636
Slowed down? Have we
been going fast here?

1572
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,847
Now, look, this has been

1573
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:35,344
a real, real difficult time
for me this past year or so.

1574
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:39,564
I feel like I'm above
water for the first time.

1575
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:44,319
I feel like I know a lot more now, and I
don't want to make any more mistakes.

1576
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,814
I think I need time

1577
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:48,990
to make the right choices...

1578
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,117
Wait, wait. I'm lost here.

1579
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,495
I think that maybe I should...

1580
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,773
be alone for a while.

1581
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:02,155
Now that I know more,
you know, I feel

1582
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:08,343
that I should focus on my career now
that everything's taken care of.

1583
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:12,096
All right, first of all, let me
just say one thing, okay?

1584
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,809
You don't know shit. Okay?

1585
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:17,727
Secondly,

1586
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:22,106
as far as we go, what have we
been doing here except time?

1587
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:25,807
Have I ever pressured
you once, ever?

1588
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,190
No. So, what time
do you need, baby?

1589
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:34,953
I love you, you love me. You
wanna get your career going?

1590
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:37,997
I think that's the greatest
thing in the world.

1591
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:41,125
I want to be there when it happens.

1592
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:44,996
So, what do you need
time to figure out, huh?

1593
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:51,249
All right, let me just
ask you one thing.

1594
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,714
Do you love me?

1595
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:58,760
I don't know.

1596
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:05,221
You can't even give
me that, can you?

1597
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:09,445
Jesus, Jack. What were you
planning on doing here?

1598
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:12,991
Packing up and dropping me a
note when you met somebody new?

1599
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,493
I have no idea what I
was planning to do.

1600
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,203
I just said I need time.

1601
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:20,290
Bullshit! If you're gonna
hurt me, hurt me now.

1602
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,334
Not some long, drawn-out hurt
that takes months of my life

1603
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:26,079
because you don't have the balls!

1604
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:31,501
Okay. I'll pack my stuff tonight.

1605
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:34,762
What have you been doing
here? Can you tell me that?

1606
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:36,915
What have you been doing here?

1607
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,143
- We both got something out of it.
- What did I get?!

1608
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:42,020
What did I get?!

1609
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:45,231
What did I get I couldn't
have gotten from anybody

1610
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,191
any night of the week?!

1611
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,694
Do you think your company
is such a treat?

1612
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:52,322
Your moods, your
pain, your problems.

1613
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,198
You think this has
been entertaining?

1614
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,601
Then what do you wanna
stay with me for?

1615
01:46:59,038 --> 01:47:02,191
Because I love you.

1616
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,661
You stupid fucking...

1617
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:09,998
Hey, hey.

1618
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:12,884
Anne.

1619
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:14,677
Shh. Shh.

1620
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,220
Anne.

1621
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:29,359
No. Stop it, stop it. Don't.

1622
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,183
No, you don't get to be nice!

1623
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:37,116
I ain't gonna play a stupid
game where we act like friends

1624
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:40,411
so you get to walk out
feeling good about yourself.

1625
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,814
I'm not a modern woman.

1626
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,916
If this is over,

1627
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,615
let's just call it over.

1628
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:14,642
Yeah? Yeah.

1629
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,727
My wallet? What do you mean?

1630
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:34,245
Parry.

1631
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,170
Parry.

1632
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:42,265
Parry?

1633
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:44,339
He can't hear you.

1634
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:49,131
I'm Dr. Mandeville. I was on
duty when they brought him in.

1635
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:53,985
I went over his record. He
was brought in once before.

1636
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:57,697
Catatonic stupor, condition
rendered him nonverbal.

1637
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,866
Yeah. So he's been beat up.

1638
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,440
He's got a concussion, right?

1639
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:05,455
Right? He's gonna snap out of it.

1640
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:07,608
I'm afraid not.

1641
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,501
The beating's bad,
but it's not the problem.

1642
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:13,171
He seems to be
re-experiencing catatonia.

1643
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,673
Like before, he could snap
out of it in an hour,

1644
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:18,668
or 13 months, 13 years.

1645
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:23,540
There's no way to be sure.

1646
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:29,854
A person could re-experience
the full effect of a tragedy

1647
01:49:29,855 --> 01:49:32,508
long after the event took place.

1648
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:35,431
I was reading how he lost his wife.

1649
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:37,729
Are you relatives?

1650
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:41,866
Well, it doesn't matter.
We'll take care of him.

1651
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:45,237
He'll have to be sent back
to the same institution.

1652
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:49,358
What if I was a relative?

1653
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:52,168
You'd have the option to
care for him at home.

1654
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:56,464
My advice is, I wouldn't recommend
it. It wouldn't be good for him.

1655
01:49:56,465 --> 01:49:58,800
He needs hospital care.

1656
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:02,671
I thought you could sign the release
forms, but the city can do that.

1657
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:05,874
I'm sorry.

1658
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:12,972
Poor Lydia.

1659
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:17,143
She finally finds her prince
and he falls into a coma.

1660
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,894
Some women just have no luck, huh?

1661
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,441
Anne. Anne.

1662
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:32,696
Anne.

1663
01:50:41,927 --> 01:50:44,250
I'll call you, okay?

1664
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,644
The answer: two dwarfs and a melon.

1665
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,856
Have a perfect weekend.
And remember, on Monday

1666
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:57,692
we have as our special
guest, Ben Starr,

1667
01:50:57,693 --> 01:51:01,612
star of the recently defunct
hit TV show <i>On the Radio.</i>

1668
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:06,242
From one of the botched to all of you
bungled cats out there, I love you,

1669
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:07,869
and right back at you.

1670
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:10,496
<i>Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back</i>

1671
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:12,582
<i>No more, no more
No more, no more</i>

1672
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:15,918
Yeah.

1673
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:20,324
Yeah, Lou. Look, I said I want
an offer or they can forget it.

1674
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:25,219
Uh-huh. Tell them I'm talking to the
cable people about a talk show.

1675
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,997
What?

1676
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:30,338
Beth's father set it up.

1677
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:32,268
No, he owns it.

1678
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:33,936
<i>I've got the power</i>

1679
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:43,225
<i>I've got the power</i>

1680
01:51:49,453 --> 01:51:51,078
<i>I've got the power</i>

1681
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:53,539
- You gotta get out of here.
- I'm not bothering...

1682
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:55,458
- Come on, you gotta move it.
- Jack!

1683
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,251
Come on, let's go. Come on.

1684
01:51:57,252 --> 01:52:00,451
Jack! No, it's Jack. It's me!

1685
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,590
Stop it, I know that guy!

1686
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:05,134
Jack, do you remember me?

1687
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:07,845
- Venice! You know me!
- Hey, come on. Come on.

1688
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:10,640
Jack, can I talk to you, please?

1689
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:11,974
I need to talk...

1690
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,518
- We spent time together.
- Let's go.

1691
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:18,298
- Please let me talk to him.
- Do you know this guy?

1692
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:20,676
Why won't you talk to me?

1693
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:22,685
Leave me alone!

1694
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,695
Jack!

1695
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:26,864
<i>I've got the power</i>

1696
01:52:26,865 --> 01:52:29,533
It's a weekly comedy
about the homeless.

1697
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:31,452
But it's not depressing in any way.

1698
01:52:31,453 --> 01:52:34,413
We want to find a funny, upbeat way

1699
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:37,375
of bringing the issue of
homelessness to television.

1700
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,997
So we've got three wacky
homeless characters.

1701
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:45,007
But they're wise.
They're wacky and wise.

1702
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,176
The hook is they
love being homeless.

1703
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:49,637
They love the freedom,
the adventure.

1704
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:54,225
It's about the joy of living, not the
shit we deal with: money, politics.

1705
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:58,729
And the best part is,
it's called <i>Home Free.</i>

1706
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,883
Ooh. I'm getting a rush.

1707
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:05,278
Oh. Really.

1708
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:07,571
Is this another disappearing
act with this guy?

1709
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:11,784
No. It's not a problem.
It's a bathroom break.

1710
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,562
I'll check.

1711
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,417
Shit!

1712
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:36,726
Oh, Parry.

1713
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:39,846
<i>- There.
- What?</i>

1714
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,179
<i>It's a Grail.</i>

1715
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:45,889
<i>The Holy Grail.</i>

1716
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:48,180
<i>The Holy...</i>

1717
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:53,659
<i>Some billionaire has got the Holy
Grail in his library on Fifth Avenue?</i>

1718
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:58,190
<i>I know. Who'd think you'd
find anything divine there?</i>

1719
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:02,960
<i>They said</i>

1720
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:05,079
<i>you're the one.</i>

1721
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,453
Henry Sagan?

1722
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:06,482
Pardon me. Not long ago, I left
some new sheets for Parry.

1723
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:10,528
They were lime-colored, much like
this color, with watermelons.

1724
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:13,656
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
They're being cleaned.

1725
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:16,492
The doctor had a little
accident with the hypo.

1726
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:19,829
Just make sure that he does
get them when they are clean.

1727
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,607
Thank you.

1728
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,960
Guys, settle down.

1729
01:55:43,562 --> 01:55:46,636
Hi. It's Jack.

1730
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:51,853
How you doing? You're looking good.

1731
01:55:51,903 --> 01:55:53,725
You do.

1732
01:55:56,158 --> 01:55:57,901
Hey.

1733
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,943
You gonna wake up for me? Hm?

1734
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:25,011
This isn't over, is it?

1735
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:29,690
You think you'll make
me do this, don't you?

1736
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:32,318
Well, forget it. No fucking way.

1737
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,696
I don't feel responsible
for you or for anybody.

1738
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:39,492
Everybody's got bad things that
happen to them. I'm not God.

1739
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:41,486
I don't decide...

1740
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:45,486
People survive.

1741
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:51,662
Say something!

1742
01:57:02,224 --> 01:57:04,683
Everything's been going great.

1743
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,301
Great.

1744
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:09,939
I'm gonna have my own
cable talk show.

1745
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,357
Mm-hm.

1746
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:14,637
With an incredible
equity, I might add.

1747
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:19,281
I've got an incredible... Incredibly
fucking gorgeous girlfriend.

1748
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:22,777
I'm living an incredible
fucking life.

1749
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:26,497
So don't lay there in
your comfortable coma

1750
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:30,376
and think I'm gonna risk all that
because I feel responsible for you.

1751
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:33,155
I'm not responsible!

1752
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:38,592
I don't feel guilty. You've
got it easy. I'm out there,

1753
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:40,970
every fucking day

1754
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:44,014
trying to figure out
what the hell I'm doing.

1755
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:47,589
No matter what I have, it
feels like I have nothing.

1756
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:53,846
I don't feel sorry for you. It's
easy being nuts. Try being me.

1757
01:57:58,113 --> 01:57:59,989
So I won't do it.

1758
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:02,609
I don't believe in this shit.

1759
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,871
Don't give me that stuff
about me being the one.

1760
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,748
There's nothing,

1761
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:12,618
nothing special about me.

1762
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:16,990
I control my own destiny,

1763
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:20,384
not some floating,
overweight fairies.

1764
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:24,138
I decide what I'm gonna do,
and I'm not gonna risk my life

1765
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:27,891
to get some fucking cup for
some fucking vegetable!

1766
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:29,768
Motherfucker!

1767
01:58:29,769 --> 01:58:31,637
What am I supposed to do?!

1768
01:58:34,316 --> 01:58:36,593
What am I supposed to do?

1769
01:58:38,903 --> 01:58:41,726
What am I supposed to do?

1770
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,518
Cup...

1771
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:53,834
All right, for sake of argument,
let's say I do do this.

1772
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:57,455
Okay? If I do this,

1773
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:02,384
I want you to know it wouldn't
be because I felt I had to

1774
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:05,971
or because I felt cursed
or guilty or responsible.

1775
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:08,090
If I do this...

1776
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,338
Shit.

1777
01:59:17,942 --> 01:59:20,390
If I do this,

1778
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:22,685
and I mean if...

1779
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:28,312
it's because I want
to do this for you.

1780
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,613
That's all.

1781
01:59:31,289 --> 01:59:33,282
For you.

1782
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:43,125
Don't go anywhere.

1783
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:04,017
Shit!

1784
02:00:42,861 --> 02:00:44,638
Great.

1785
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,520
I'm hearing horses now.
Parry will be so pleased.

1786
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:55,698
Radio personality turns
screwball on mission from God.

1787
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,418
I just hope when they put me away,

1788
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:02,572
they find me a place
right next to his.

1789
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,918
Okay.

1790
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:50,328
Fuck!

1791
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:08,684
Thank God nobody looks
up in this town.

1792
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:40,799
Shit.

1793
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:23,406
"Lannie Carmichael.

1794
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,959
Christmas 1932."

1795
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:48,639
Shit.

1796
02:04:48,856 --> 02:04:53,432
Hey. Hey, come on. Wake up!

1797
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:01,981
Christ!

1798
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:03,498
All right, I did my
side of the bargain.

1799
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:08,090
Here's your cup.

1800
02:06:12,148 --> 02:06:14,346
You gonna wake up now?

1801
02:06:23,159 --> 02:06:26,233
You want to think about
it a little more.

1802
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:29,068
Okay.

1803
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,902
Take your time.

1804
02:07:51,164 --> 02:07:53,817
I had this dream, Jack.

1805
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:56,326
I was married.

1806
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:01,032
I was married to this
beautiful woman.

1807
02:08:02,758 --> 02:08:05,081
And you were there too.

1808
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:11,125
I really miss her, Jack.

1809
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:14,678
Is that okay?

1810
02:08:15,813 --> 02:08:18,432
Can I miss her now?

1811
02:08:21,319 --> 02:08:23,312
Thank you.

1812
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,977
Tempo, okay. Allegro. Here we go.

1813
02:08:55,978 --> 02:08:59,397
I like New York in June

1814
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:01,775
How about you?

1815
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:05,195
I like a Gershwin tune

1816
02:09:05,196 --> 02:09:07,656
How about you?

1817
02:09:07,657 --> 02:09:13,495
I like a fireside
When a storm is due

1818
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:16,915
I like potato chips
And moonlight and motor trips

1819
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:19,793
How about you?

1820
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:22,837
I'm mad about good books

1821
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:30,083
Hi, sweetheart. Where you been?

1822
02:09:32,515 --> 02:09:37,261
Hey. What's this face all about?
Why are you crying?

1823
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:40,272
Are you my girl?

1824
02:09:40,273 --> 02:09:42,095
Huh?

1825
02:09:42,525 --> 02:09:44,768
Are you my girl?

1826
02:09:45,278 --> 02:09:47,055
Yes.

1827
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:53,231
Hey.

1828
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:55,813
Baby.

1829
02:09:57,081 --> 02:09:58,748
Tempo.

1830
02:09:58,749 --> 02:10:03,295
Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low

1831
02:10:03,296 --> 02:10:05,880
May not be new

1832
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:08,133
But I like it

1833
02:10:10,303 --> 02:10:16,961
How about you?

1834
02:10:31,782 --> 02:10:33,650
Well...

1835
02:10:38,456 --> 02:10:42,531
What do you expect
me to do? Applaud?

1836
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:53,162
What? What?

1837
02:10:53,179 --> 02:10:55,456
What'd you come here for?

1838
02:10:55,473 --> 02:10:59,392
Did you come to get the rest
of your stuff? It all got burned...

1839
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:01,010
accidentally.

1840
02:11:06,817 --> 02:11:10,195
Whatever the hell it is
you're doing, don't do it.

1841
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:12,113
You don't just show up here

1842
02:11:12,114 --> 02:11:15,784
and stand there like a statue
and make me do all the work.

1843
02:11:15,785 --> 02:11:18,187
What did you come here for?

1844
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,868
I, uh...

1845
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,576
love you.

1846
02:11:31,717 --> 02:11:33,414
What?

1847
02:11:44,355 --> 02:11:45,772
I didn't get that.

1848
02:11:45,773 --> 02:11:48,426
Would you run it by me again?

1849
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:59,903
I think, um...

1850
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:02,777
I realize...

1851
02:12:07,461 --> 02:12:09,704
I love you.

1852
02:12:11,674 --> 02:12:13,872
You love me, huh?

1853
02:12:28,315 --> 02:12:31,218
You son of a bitch!

1854
02:12:47,877 --> 02:12:51,201
God, what a beautiful night, huh?

1855
02:12:52,923 --> 02:12:55,792
- Hey, look.
- What?

1856
02:12:56,051 --> 02:12:58,078
They're moving.

1857
02:12:59,638 --> 02:13:01,723
Am I doing that?

1858
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:04,343
Are you crazy? It's the wind.

1859
02:13:08,564 --> 02:13:11,774
I like New York in June

1860
02:13:11,775 --> 02:13:15,153
How about you?

1861
02:13:15,154 --> 02:13:19,199
I like a Gershwin tune

1862
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:22,160
How about you?

1863
02:13:40,513 --> 02:13:42,388
Good night, Manhattan!

1864
02:13:42,389 --> 02:13:44,766
- Say good night, Jack.
- Good night, Jack.
