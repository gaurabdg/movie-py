1
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,763
Bread of heaven
Bread of heaven

2
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,868
In this barren wilderness

3
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:57,844
Song of praises
Song of praises

4
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:02,932
I will ever give to thee

5
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:52,982
Be the Lord my righteousness

6
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,863
Song of praises
Song of praises

7
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,783
I will ever give to thee...

8
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,178
Death of death and hell's...

9
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:34,732
Song of praises
Song of praises

10
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:46,160
I will ever give to thee

11
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,999
When I tread the verge of Jordan

12
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,174
Song of praises

13
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:12,061
I will ever give to thee

14
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,313
Amen.

15
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:18,442
Amen

16
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,052
-Hello, Reverend.
-Mr. Allnut.

17
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,554
-Here's your mail.
-Thank you.

18
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,348
Sorry l'm late, but one thing and another
kept me in Limbasi.

19
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,726
You know how it is. Maybe you don't.

20
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,270
-Good morning, Mr. Allnut.
-Good morning, miss.

21
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,857
Splendid, they've come at last.
My rose trees.

22
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,900
-You'll stay for tea?
-Don't mind if l do.

23
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,695
l sure need something in my condition.

24
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,864
l'm in for a going over
when l get back to the mine.

25
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,824
Them Belgians are calling me
all the names they can think of,

26
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,993
but l don't mind being cussed out
in a foreign language.

27
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,327
They won't fire me.

28
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,455
Ain't nobody in Africa except yours truly

29
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,125
can get up a good head of steam
on the old African Queen.

30
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,466
You take sugar,
l seem to remember, Mr. Allnut?

31
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,927
That's right, miss. Couple of spoonfuls.

32
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,345
And milk?

33
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,057
That's right, miss.

34
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,071
-Bread and butter?
-That's right, miss.

35
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,574
-Brother.
-Thank you.

36
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,961
Just listen to this stomach of mine.

37
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,840
The way it sounds,
you'd think l had a hyena inside me.

38
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,425
Do have some more
bread and butter, Mr. Allnut.

39
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,220
Thanks, miss. l... l don't mind if l do.

40
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,431
Excuse me.

41
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,690
Queer thing, ain't it? What l mean is,

42
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,401
what do you suppose makes
a man's stomach carry on like this?

43
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,695
Try a rock cake, Mr. Allnut.

44
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,656
No, thanks, miss.

45
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,741
Herbie Morton's a bishop.

46
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,913
-Who's that, dear?
-Dear, surely you remember Herbie.

47
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,041
Blond, a bit younger
than l am, ruddy-faced.

48
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,544
He sang a solo
at the commemoration concert.

49
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,254
HoIy, HoIy, l think it was.

50
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,215
l think l remember. lt was so long ago.

51
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,551
-He's a bishop now.
-Splendid.

52
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,928
Yes, l'd say Herbie was
a bit younger than me,

53
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,682
four or five years. Surprising, really.

54
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,684
He wasn't up to much as a student,

55
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,604
didn't have more than his share
of the social graces.

56
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,106
Then, of course, he married well.

57
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,276
Yes. That manufacturer's widow.

58
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,198
What was his name, Griggs?
Briggs. That was it. Alfred Briggs.

59
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,701
Soap flakes, l think. Mrs. Alfred Briggs.

60
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,163
Not to take anything away from Herbie.
l'm delighted for him, naturally.

61
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,664
Of course.

62
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,877
Ain't a thing l can do about it.

63
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,879
It was Holy, Holy.

64
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,839
More tea, Mr. Allnut?

65
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,467
Thank you, no, miss.
l reckon l'd better be shoving off

66
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,053
if l'm to get back to the mine
before tomorrow night.

67
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,722
-Don't hurry, Mr. Allnut.
-Do stay for dinner.

68
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,682
Thanks just the same.

69
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,731
l probably won't be coming around
this way for a couple of months.

70
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,858
Really? Well, what about our mail?

71
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,110
Don't look like there's going
to be any mail for a while.

72
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,403
Why not?

73
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,907
-The Germans will hold it up.
-Why, in heaven's name?

74
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,244
-On account of the war.
-War? Where, Mr. Allnut?

75
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,121
-Europe.
-lndeed. Between whom?

76
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,999
Germany, England...

77
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,084
-England?
-England?

78
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,920
-That's right.
-You really mean war?

79
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,922
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

80
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,425
Germans claim the British started it,
British claim it was the Germans.

81
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,219
Well, what do you know about it?
What's happened?

82
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,681
Well, let's see. l...
That's all l can remember.

83
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,308
Yes, the French are in it,
and all them little countries.

84
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,436
Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Spain.

85
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,063
l forget who's with who.

86
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,774
-ls that all you can tell us?
-That's all l know.

87
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,818
l'll see what l can find out
when l get to Limbasi.

88
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,028
Well, l'm wondering
what our position will be. Enemy aliens.

89
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,905
What harm could anybody do
the Germans

90
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,991
in this godforsaken place?

91
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,201
God has not forsaken
this place, Mr. Allnut,

92
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,578
as my brother's presence here
bears witness.

93
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,123
-No offense, miss.
-War.

94
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,667
Yeah. Yeah, looks like it.

95
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,546
Well, l'll be shoving off.
Thanks for the tea.

96
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,464
Take care of yourselves.

97
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,302
-Goodbye. Thank you.
-Goodbye, Mr. Allnut.

98
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,973
Wretched little man. What indifference.
He's a Canadian.

99
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,309
Doesn't he realize he's in this, too?

100
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,978
Shouldn't we perhaps try
to get to Limbasi while we can?

101
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,855
A good shepherd
doesn't desert his flock

102
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,149
when the wolves are prowling.

103
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,447
We must ask the Almighty
to bless the arms of England

104
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,241
and carry her through her hour of trial.

105
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,047
Rose, go into the house and stay there.

106
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,341
What's the meaning of this outrage?
How dare you!

107
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,337
Samuel!

108
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,426
Dear, here you are.
And without your hat on.

109
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,178
Didn't you hear me calling you?

110
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,432
Yes, but l must get the seeds in now.
lt's a bit late. August.

111
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,895
But, dear, you know it doesn't matter
when one plants in Central Africa.

112
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,398
Africa?

113
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,409
Brother, dear, you're not at all well.

114
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,744
Africa?

115
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,715
-l'll help you off with your things.
-Rose.

116
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,499
Brother. Brother. Dear.

117
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,137
Smite the Amalekites, O Lord.
Smite them, hip and thigh.

118
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,847
Amen.

119
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,810
Cold. Foggy.

120
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,312
Where's Rose?

121
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,773
Rose, are you down there in the shop?

122
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,983
l'm here.

123
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,860
Bring me a nice, hot cup of tea.

124
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,196
l'm here, Brother, beside you.

125
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,324
l try so hard, you know, to study.

126
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,579
Hebrew, Greek. l've got no facility.

127
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,959
lf l don't pass the examinations,
l shall volunteer as a missionary.

128
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,794
Rose, too.

129
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,590
Not comely among the maidens,
but she, too, can be a servant

130
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,758
in the house of the Lord.

131
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,345
Even for such as she,
God has a goodly purpose.

132
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,685
l'm going to put my books away.
l'm not going to work anymore.

133
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,772
lf l don't pass, it'll just mean
that God has other work for me.

134
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,066
Thy will be done.

135
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,531
O Lord, if it be thy will,
let me distinguish myself.

136
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,745
Give me a call here in England at home.

137
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,998
Mother would be so proud.

138
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,462
O Lord, l've tried so hard.

139
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,619
So they been here, too, eh?

140
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,248
After l left here the other day,
the drums started in the forest.

141
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,876
Pretty soon, my boys was moaning
and rolling their eyes.

142
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,963
l asked them what the trouble was,
and they told me the drums said

143
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,090
the soldiers was rounding up
their people

144
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,217
and marching them off
and burning their villages

145
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,720
so they wouldn't have
no homes to come back to.

146
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,181
Sure enough, when l got to the mine,
everything was a shambles.

147
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,435
My boys took one look
and bolted into the forest.

148
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,398
The way l look at it,
they plan to make soldiers of the natives

149
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,235
and take over all Africa.
Where's the Reverend?

150
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,321
He's in there. He's dead.

151
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,035
Well, now, ain't that awful?

152
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,664
lf they'd up and shoot a reverend
couldn't do them a bit of harm,

153
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,960
-well, there ain't nobody safe.
-They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnut,

154
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,337
but they may as well have done.

155
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,009
That's certainly too bad, miss.
That's all l can say.

156
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,764
-When'd he die, miss?
-He died early this morning.

157
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,102
Excuse me, miss. What l mean to say
is, what with the climate and all,

158
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,938
the quicker we get him
under the ground, the better.

159
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,609
lf you don't mind my saying so.
You got a spade?

160
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,361
Behind the bungalow.

161
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,948
l expect he'd like to be buried
in the shade.

162
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,034
l'll tell you what.
While l'm digging the grave,

163
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,536
you get your things together,
all the things you want to carry,

164
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,954
and then we can clear out of here
in a hurry.

165
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,540
The Germans might come back anytime.

166
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,794
-Why should they?
-They'll be back, all right,

167
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,253
looking for the African Queen.

168
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,714
They'd give a lot to get their hands
on her, you bet.

169
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,049
And what's in her, too.

170
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,135
Blasting gelatin, tinned grub,
cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen,

171
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,722
heaps of things them Germans
could use. You can trust them for that.

172
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,015
The Germans.

173
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,894
See, l figure we could go somewheres
behind an island where it's quiet

174
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,730
-and we can talk about what to do.
-l'll get ready.

175
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,483
Fine. l'll be as quick as l can.

176
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,464
Let's go, miss.
Let's go while the going's good.

177
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,751
Pardon me.

178
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,151
Mind taking the tiller, miss? Come on.

179
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,154
-But l can't steer.
-Come on.

180
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,958
A little to starboard, miss.
No, no, the other way.

181
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,685
So far, so good.

182
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,271
Here we are, safe and sound,
as you might say.

183
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,774
-The question is, what next?
-Quite.

184
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,818
We got heaps of grub here, miss,
so we're all right as far as that goes.

185
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,947
Two thousand cigarettes.
Two cases of gin.

186
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,407
We could stay here for months
if we wanted to.

187
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,035
lt's not a bad place to sit out a war,
then, is it, miss?

188
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,455
All the comforts of home,
including running water.

189
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
We simply can't remain here
in this backwater

190
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,793
until the war is over, Mr. Allnut.

191
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,504
Can't we, miss? You got the map.

192
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,381
Show me a way out and l'll take it.

193
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,299
The British will certainly
launch an attack.

194
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,635
The only question is,
which way will they come?

195
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,804
Maybe from the sea,
up the railway to Limbasi.

196
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,639
But that would put the Germans
between us and them.

197
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,141
Mightn't our soldiers
come in from British East, Mr. Allnut?

198
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah, they might,
but the war in Europe would be over

199
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,063
before they ever hacked their way
through that forest.

200
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,941
We're in a bit of a fix, miss,
no matter which way you look at it.

201
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,859
There's one thing certain.
They won't come up from the Congo,

202
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,320
not even if they wanted to.
They gotta cross that lake,

203
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,739
and nothing's going to cross that lake
while the Louisa's there.

204
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,325
-The Louisa? What's that?
-A hundred-ton steamer, miss.

205
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,536
The Germans brought her
overland in sections.

206
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,038
She's the boss of the lake
'cause she's got a six-pounder.

207
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,748
A six-pounder? What's that?

208
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,002
A gun, miss.
The biggest gun in Central Africa.

209
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,837
-l see.
-lf it wasn't for the Louisa,

210
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,755
there wouldn't be nothing to it.

211
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,551
The Germans wouldn't last a month
if our men could get across the lake,

212
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,512
but all that don't get us
any closer to home, does it, miss?

213
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,516
This river, the Ulanga,
runs into the lake,

214
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,059
doesn't it, Mr. Allnut?

215
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, yes, miss, it does,
but if you got any ideas

216
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,689
about going down to the lake
in this launch,

217
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,108
-you better get rid of them.
-Why?

218
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,153
Well, first off, there's Shona.

219
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,363
The Germans have a fort there
overlooking the river.

220
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,366
lf we tried to pass under their guns,
they'd blow us right out of the water.

221
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,368
And then after that, miss,
there's the rapids.

222
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,787
A hundred miles of water
like it was coming out of a fire hose.

223
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,832
After that, why,
the river's even got a different name.

224
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,917
lt's called the Bora.
That just goes to show you

225
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,461
they didn't even know
it was the same river

226
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,797
-until this fellow Spengler got...
-He got down it, l remember.

227
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,342
Yes, miss, in a dugout canoe.
He had a half a dozen Swahili paddlers.

228
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,428
Map-making, he was.
That was his map you was looking at.

229
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,346
-Mr. Allnut.
-Yes, miss?

230
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,267
What did you say is in these boxes
with the red lines on them?

231
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,395
Well, them, that's blasting gelatin, miss.

232
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,521
ls it dangerous?

233
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,732
Bless you, no, miss.
That's safety stuff, that is.

234
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,400
You can get it wet
and it don't do it any harm.

235
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,235
You set fire to it, and it just burns.

236
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,404
You can hit it with a hammer
and it won't go off.

237
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,239
At least, l don't think it will.

238
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,908
Takes a detonator to set it off.

239
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,534
l'll put it over the side, though,
if it worries you.

240
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,786
No, we may want it.

241
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,704
-Mr. Allnut.
-Yes, miss?

242
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,042
What are these long, round,
torpedo-like things?

243
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,754
Them? Them's oxygen
and hydrogen cylinders, miss.

244
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,632
-Mr. Allnut.
-l'm still right here, miss.

245
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,219
There ain't much of any other place
l could be on a 30-foot boat.

246
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,431
You're a machinist, aren't you? l mean,
wasn't that your position at the mine?

247
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,143
Yes, a kind of a fixer, jack of all trades
and master of none, like they say.

248
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,772
-Could you make a torpedo?
-How's that, miss?

249
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,776
-Could you make a torpedo?
-A torpedo?

250
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,114
Ask me to make a dreadnought,
and do it up right.

251
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,406
A torpedo, miss...

252
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,450
You don't really know
what you're asking.

253
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:16,371
You see, there ain't nothing so
complicated as the insides of a torpedo.

254
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,457
lt's got gyroscopes, compressed
air chambers, compensating...

255
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,668
But all those things,
those gyroscopes and things,

256
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,254
-they're only to make it go, aren't they?
-Yeah.

257
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,422
Yeah, go and hit what it's aimed at.

258
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,301
Well, we've got the African Queen.

259
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,928
How's that, miss?

260
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,849
lf we were to fill those cylinders
with that blasting gelatin

261
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,809
and then fix them so that
they would stick out

262
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,893
over the end of the boat,

263
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,312
and then run the boat
against the side of a ship,

264
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,691
they would go off,
just like a torpedo, wouldn't they?

265
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,609
Yeah, yeah, if they had detonators
in the ends.

266
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,528
We could... What do you call it?
Get a good head of steam up,

267
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,489
and then point the launch toward a ship,
and just before she hits,

268
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,658
we could dive off, couldn't we?

269
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,828
Sure, miss, sure. Absolutely.

270
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,330
There's only one little thing wrong
with your idea.

271
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,668
-There ain't nothing to torpedo.
-Yes, there is.

272
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,254
-There's what?
-Something to torpedo.

273
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,840
-What's that?
-The Louisa.

274
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,010
The Louisa? Now, don't talk silly, miss.

275
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,720
You can't do that. Honest, you can't.

276
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,680
l told you before,
we can't get down the Ulanga.

277
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,098
-Spengler did.
-ln a canoe, miss...

278
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,766
-lf a German did it, we can, too.
-Not in no launch.

279
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,018
How do you know? You never tried it.

280
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,188
l never tried shooting myself
in the head, neither.

281
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:28,276
The trouble with you, miss, is you...
You don't know anything about boats.

282
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,321
ln other words,
you are refusing to help your country

283
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,740
in her hour of need, Mr. Allnut?

284
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,202
Well, l wouldn't put it that way.

285
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,913
Just how would you put it, Mr. Allnut?

286
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,375
All right, miss, have it your own way,
but don't blame me for what happens.

287
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,544
Very well, then. Let's get started.

288
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,838
-What, now, miss?
-Yes, now.

289
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,007
There ain't two hours
of daylight left, miss.

290
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,968
We can go a long way
in two hours, Mr. Allnut.

291
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,639
l'll have to get
the old kettle to boiling and...

292
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,308
Well, do so, Mr. Allnut.

293
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,821
"Could you make a torpedo?

294
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,200
"Well, do so, Mr. Allnut."

295
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,837
A little to starboard, miss. That's right.

296
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,298
Hey, you're doing fine, miss.

297
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:36,552
lt's really quite easy, isn't it, Mr. Allnut?

298
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,431
-Well, you gotta learn to read the river.
-Read the river?

299
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,976
Yeah. You see that
long thing over there,

300
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,730
looks kind of like a "V"?
That means a snag.

301
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:51,442
Now, this choppy water over here,
that means shallow.

302
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,530
The Queen don't draw much water,
so we can go right over them.

303
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,865
Most boats would
get their bottoms tore up.

304
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,371
And when it's smooth and flat
like that over there,

305
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,500
-does that mean a rock, Mr. Allnut?
-Rock or hippo, miss.

306
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,005
But don't go bumping into no hippo.
Makes them awful mad.

307
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,091
This boat's only big enough
for the two of us.

308
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,618
-What was the matter, Mr. Allnut?
-Feed pump's full of scum and rust.

309
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,289
She gets clogged up.
Kicking her starts her to working again.

310
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,375
l gotta act fast, 'cause one of my boys
dropped a screwdriver

311
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,044
down the safety valve.

312
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,880
What would happen
if you didn't kick her?

313
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,758
Whole boiler would blow up.

314
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,094
But if we're going
downstream, Mr. Allnut,

315
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,347
why do we need the engine at all?

316
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,683
Boat's got to go faster than the water
or you can't steer.

317
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,979
lf l was to let the engine die
going down the rapids, we'd be goners.

318
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,025
-Mr. Allnut?
-Yes, miss?

319
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,402
Why don't you dismantle
the safety valve

320
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,237
and remove the screwdriver?

321
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,698
You know, l'm going
to do that one of these days.

322
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,617
The only reason l ain't done it up to now

323
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,662
is that l kind of like kicking her.
She's all l've got.

324
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,656
lt's kind of hot work, ain't it, miss?

325
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,909
l could do with a drink.
Excuse me, miss.

326
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,521
-You going to have one, miss?
-No.

327
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,317
-What is it?
-Gin, miss.

328
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,537
-Something the matter, miss?
-No.

329
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,791
How'd you like a nice cup of tea?

330
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,044
l'd like a cup of tea.

331
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,315
Course, it'll taste a little rusty,

332
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,193
but then
we can't have everything, can we?

333
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,989
There you are.
l'll get this out of the way.

334
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,370
-Sugar, miss?
-Thank you.

335
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,080
Don't mention it.

336
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,428
-Have a bit of supper, miss?
-lt's too hot to eat.

337
00:30:55,812 --> 00:31:00,316
-How long you been out here, miss?
-About 10 years.

338
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,901
And what part of England
do you come from?

339
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,529
-The Midlands.
-lt sounds pretty, anyway.

340
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,739
Yes, it is. lt's very pretty.

341
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,491
Ever get homesick?

342
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,037
lt's Sunday afternoons l think of most.

343
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,873
The peace and the quiet.

344
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:20,253
On Sunday afternoons,
l was always sleeping one off.

345
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:26,217
-This is very, very good.
-Yes, it isn't half bad, is it?

346
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,720
-What brought you to Africa, Mr. Allnut?
-The Zambezi Bridge, miss.

347
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,098
A whole boatload of us Canucks
came over to work on it.

348
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,558
Don't know yet
what they wanted a bridge for,

349
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:38,396
both sides of the river being the same,
but why does a chicken cross the road?

350
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,692
-l beg your pardon?
-Nothing, miss.

351
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,822
Sometimes l wish
l was back rubbing elbows, as they say.

352
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,949
You know, there's nothing
like the jostle and the noise

353
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,369
and the music of a Saturday night
for cheering a fellow up.

354
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,497
The rest of the week
l'd be taking orders from somebody.

355
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,792
Out here, l'm my own boss.
Anyway, l was, until...

356
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,339
You didn't see any crocodiles
in this arm, did you, miss?

357
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,008
Crocodiles? No.

358
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,636
There's no shallows for them.
The current's too swift.

359
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,931
l could do with a bath before l turn in.

360
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,058
l'd like a bath myself.

361
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,894
Well, then, l'll just go up in the bow
and hang off the anchor chain.

362
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,940
You can stay back here in the stern
and do whatever you have to.

363
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,819
Just so long as we don't look,
it won't matter, huh?

364
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,489
Well, how about it, miss?

365
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,243
Very well, Mr. Allnut.

366
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,037
That's the ticket.

367
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,194
-Mr. Allnut.
-Right here.

368
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,699
-l can't get back into the boat.
-l'll give you a hand.

369
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,326
Close your eyes, please, Mr. Allnut.

370
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,956
All right. l'm all right. Thank you.

371
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,713
Mr. Allnut!

372
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,800
Hi. Sorry l woke you, miss.

373
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,593
What are you doing?

374
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:43,891
-l ain't doing nothing, miss.
-Well, get out this instant.

375
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,587
Mr. Allnut.

376
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,924
You may come in out of the rain.

377
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,100
Thank you, miss.

378
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,113
-Miss.
-Yes, Mr. Allnut?

379
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:45,953
-l'm sorry l gave you such a turn.
-That's quite all right, Mr. Allnut.

380
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,457
-Good night, miss.
-Good night, Mr. Allnut.

381
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,953
-What a frightfully strong smell.
-What smell?

382
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,042
The river. lt smells like marigolds.
Stale ones.

383
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:37,171
lt does, huh?
Not a very good smell for a flower.

384
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:42,301
-They're very pretty, though, marigolds.
-They are, huh?

385
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,597
-Mr. Allnut?
-Yes, miss?

386
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:51,560
-The current's quite strong here, isn't it?
-Yes. We're getting near the rapids.

387
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,897
-Really? So soon?
-Just around that bend.

388
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,528
Kind of dangerous.
You better let me take over.

389
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,691
Here you are, miss.

390
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,540
-Well, miss?
-Yes, Mr. Allnut?

391
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,208
-How'd you like it?
-Like it?

392
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,878
-White water, rapids?
-l never dreamed.

393
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,964
l don't blame you for being scared, miss,
not one little bit.

394
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,009
Ain't no person in their right mind
ain't scared of white water.

395
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,595
l never dreamed
that any mere physical experience

396
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,431
-could be so stimulating.
-How's that, miss?

397
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,559
l've only known such excitement
a few times before.

398
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,686
A few times
in my dear brother's sermons,

399
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,397
when the spirit was really upon him.

400
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,274
-You mean you want to go on?
-Naturally.

401
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,735
-Miss, you're crazy!
-l beg your pardon?

402
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,903
You know what would have happened

403
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,529
if we'd come up against
one of them rocks?

404
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,739
But we didn't.

405
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,659
l must say, l'm filled with admiration
for your skill, Mr. Allnut.

406
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,746
Do you suppose
after l've practiced steering a bit,

407
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,208
-that someday l might try?
-Miss, let me tell you something.

408
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,335
Them rapids ain't nothing
to what's out in front of us.

409
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,837
On second thoughts,
l wouldn't call them rapids at all.

410
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,673
-l can hardly wait.
-But, miss...

411
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,717
Now that l've had a taste of it,

412
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,720
l don't wonder
you love boating, Mr. Allnut.

413
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,868
ls something the matter, Mr. Allnut?
Tell me.

414
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,208
Nothing. Nothing you'd understand.

415
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,293
l simply can't imagine
what could be the matter.

416
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,797
lt's been such a pleasant day.
What is it?

417
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:11,301
-Yes, Mr. Allnut?
-All this foolish talk about the Louisa,

418
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,429
-going down the river.
-What do you mean?

419
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,557
l mean we ain't going to do
nothing of the sort.

420
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,017
Of course we are. What an absurd idea.

421
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,521
"What an absurd idea.
What an absurd idea."

422
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,233
Lady, you got 10 absurd ideas
for my one.

423
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,322
Just why don't you want
to go on, Mr. Allnut?

424
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,741
-The river and Shona.
-Shona?

425
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,410
You're darn right, Shona.

426
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,079
All it would take would be one bullet
in the blasting gelatin

427
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,957
and we'd be in little bits and pieces.

428
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,835
-Then we'll go by night.
-No, we won't.

429
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,045
After Shona, there's the rapids.

430
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,757
Nobody in their might rind would
tackle the rapids at night.

431
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,009
But then we'll go in the daylight.

432
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,969
We'll go on the far side
of the river from Shona,

433
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,139
-just as fast as ever we can.
-No, we won't.

434
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,810
-You agreed to go.
-l never did.

435
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:04,271
l never agreed to nothing.

436
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:09,026
You are a liar, Mr. Allnut,
and what is worse, you are a coward.

437
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:14,489
Coward yourself.
You ain't no lady. No, miss.

438
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,659
That's what my poor old mother
would say to you.

439
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,246
lf my poor old mother were to hear you...

440
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,539
Whose boat is this, anyway?

441
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,042
l asked you on board
'cause l was sorry for you,

442
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,128
on account of you losing
your brother and all.

443
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,798
That's what you get
for feeling sorry for people.

444
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:37,971
Well, l ain't sorry no more, you crazy,
psalm-singing, skinny old maid!

445
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,776
There was a bold fisherman

446
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,780
Set sail from off Pimlico

447
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,075
And when he got off Pimlico

448
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,702
The winds did begin to blow

449
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,956
And the little boat wibble-wobbled so

450
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:08,293
That overboard went he

451
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:12,130
Singing twinkie deedIedum

452
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,426
Twinkie deedledee

453
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:21,139
Was the highly interesting
song that he sung

454
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,475
Twinkie deedledum

455
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,852
Twinkie deedledee...

456
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,885
Miss. Have pity, miss.

457
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,726
You don't know what you're doing, miss.

458
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,437
l'll perish without a hair of the dog.

459
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,230
Miss.

460
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,942
lt ain't your property!

461
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,323
What a headache.

462
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,430
There was a bold fisherman

463
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,891
Set sail from off Pimlico

464
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,392
To catch...

465
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,192
But when he got off Pimlico

466
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,110
The one...

467
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:03,367
lt's a great thing
to have a lady aboard with clean habits.

468
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,202
Sets a man a good example.

469
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,413
A man alone,
he gets to living like a hog.

470
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,709
Then, too, with me,
it's always putting things off.

471
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:16,004
Never do today what you
can put off till tomorrow.

472
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:21,093
But with you,
business before pleasure, every time.

473
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,596
Do all your personal laundry.
Make yourself spic-and-span,

474
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,184
get all the mending out of the way,
and then, and only then,

475
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,646
sit down for a nice, quiet hour
with the Good Book.

476
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,650
l tell you, it's a model,
like an inspiration.

477
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,986
Why, l ain't had this old engine
so clean in years, inside and out.

478
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,241
Just look at her, miss.
See how she practically sparkles?

479
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,951
Myself, too.

480
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,078
Guess you haven't never
had a look at me

481
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,622
without my whiskers and all cleaned up.

482
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,998
l'll bet you wouldn't hardly recognize me.

483
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,252
Works that much of a change.
Freshens you up, too.

484
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,340
lf l only had some clean clothes like you.

485
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,927
Now, you, why, you could be at high tea.

486
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,432
Say, that's an idea, miss.
How's about a nice little cup of tea?

487
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,893
Now, don't you stir.
l'll be glad to make it for you.

488
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,373
How's the book, miss?

489
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,459
Well, not that l ain't read it.
That is to say,

490
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,712
my poor old mom used to read me
stories out of it.

491
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,215
How's about reading it out loud?

492
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,095
l could sure do with a little
spiritual comfort, myself.

493
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,727
And you call yourself a Christian.

494
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,605
Do you hear me?

495
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,442
Don't you?

496
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,173
What you being so mean for, miss?

497
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,134
A man takes a drop too much
once in a while.

498
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,178
lt's only human nature.

499
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,432
Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put
in this world to rise above.

500
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,185
Miss.

501
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,356
l'm sorry. l apologize.

502
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,109
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry?

503
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,405
You done paid me back, miss.

504
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,824
You didn't even leave me a drop.

505
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,537
Miss, have a heart. Fair is fair.

506
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,621
You gotta say something.

507
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,915
l don't care what it is,
but you gotta say something.

508
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,127
l'll be honest with you, miss,
l just can't stand no more of this.

509
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,838
l just ain't used to it, that's all.

510
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:07,217
So you think it was your
nasty drunkenness l minded?

511
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:11,471
-Well, what else?
-You promised you'd go down the river.

512
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:16,309
Miss, listen to me and try to understand.

513
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:20,313
There's death a dozen times over
down the river.

514
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,608
l'm sorry to disappoint you,
but don't blame me. Blame the Ulanga.

515
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,861
-You promised.
-Well, l'm taking my promise back!

516
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:50,135
All right, miss, you win,
as the crocodiles will be glad to hear.

517
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,053
Down the river we go.

518
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,015
Have some breakfast, Mr. Allnut.

519
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,184
Thanks for asking, and l don't mind
if l do, because it'll be my last.

520
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,854
Or, no. Get up steam.

521
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,689
Breakfast can wait.

522
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,408
Waiting for their supper, miss.

523
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,253
Which side of the river is Shona on?

524
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,630
How's that, miss?

525
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,341
Which bank is Shona on?

526
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,343
Over to starboard, miss.

527
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,346
Good. Then the sun will be in their eyes.

528
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,559
l say the sun will be in their eyes.

529
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,787
Don't be worried, Mr. Allnut.

530
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,914
l ain't worried, miss.

531
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,000
Gave myself up for dead
back where we started.

532
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,007
Mr. Allnut.

533
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,099
Better get down, miss.

534
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,432
Come here.

535
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,726
Fire over the ship!

536
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,568
Get down lower, miss.

537
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,148
Nothing to do but let her drift, miss.

538
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,105
Are we going to be all right, Mr. Allnut?

539
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,357
Yes. Everything's all right.

540
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,276
lf we can keep the steam up

541
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,362
and the boiler don't bust
and that mend holds.

542
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,615
And we don't pile up on them rocks.

543
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,465
We made it! We made it!

544
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,258
Hip, hip, hooray!

545
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,928
We sure put one over on them
that time, didn't we, miss?

546
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,554
What a curious feeling
to have people shooting at you.

547
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,348
They were that surprised
to see the African Queen,

548
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,016
they didn't start shooting
till we were past.

549
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,394
One knows it's dangerous,
and yet one isn't afraid at all!

550
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,062
They didn't believe
we'd try to go down the gorge!

551
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,481
l suppose it's because the bullets
sound like mosquitoes.

552
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,857
They didn't believe anybody could!

553
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,776
l felt like slapping at them.

554
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,321
Well, we showed them!
Hip, hip, hooray!

555
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:39,252
Was my handling of the boat all right?

556
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,588
Well, yes, miss.
lt was better than all right, miss.

557
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:48,219
Well, we're running short of fuel.
We better put in someplace.

558
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:17,206
Well, l guess l better do some pumping.
We'll be swimming pretty soon.

559
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,833
-Let me do that.
-No, miss.

560
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,711
No, please, let me
while you get the fuel.

561
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,924
Hey, easy does it, miss.
Don't wear yourself out.

562
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,634
Picked up a thorn in my foot.

563
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,012
Must have gone right through
the rubber sole.

564
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,597
Let me.

565
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,779
Thank you, miss.

566
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:47,463
Do you recognize these flowers,
Mr. Allnut?

567
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,051
l've never seen them before.

568
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,889
Well, l can't say as l have, either.

569
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,559
Perhaps no one has.

570
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,270
l don't suppose they even have a name.

571
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:07,358
Whether they have or not,
they sure are pretty.

572
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:24,852
Mr. Allnut.

573
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,689
Dear.

574
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,282
Well. Well, now.

575
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,537
This is more like it, breakfast in bed.

576
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,208
Two spoonfuls of sugar is right, isn't it?

577
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,544
Fancy your building the fire and all
while l slept.

578
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,718
Dear, what is your first name?

579
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,350
-Charlie.
-Charlie.

580
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,106
That's a nice name. Charlie, Charlie.

581
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,732
Give us a kiss.

582
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,407
Charlie. Charlie.

583
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:25,162
You know, the more l look at this place,
the prettier it gets.

584
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,915
l expect it's just about
the prettiest place l've ever been to,

585
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,625
and that's saying a lot.

586
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,420
Not that l ain't all for going on
down the river, you understand.

587
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,965
The sooner we blow up
the old Louisa, the better.

588
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,633
What l meant was,

589
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,387
l'd like to come back here someday.

590
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,472
Then you think we can do it?

591
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,016
Do it? Of course we can do it.

592
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,935
Nothing a man can't do
if he believes in himself.

593
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,313
Never say die, that's my motto.

594
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,565
l've had misgivings.

595
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,526
l was beginning to think
that the whole thing was a mistake.

596
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,987
How's that, miss, l mean, Rosie?

597
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,406
l had a moment of weakness.

598
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,615
Now, if you're feeling weak,

599
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,160
a day or two more here
won't make any difference.

600
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,912
Oh, no. We'll go on.

601
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,750
Thank heaven for your strength, Charlie.

602
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:38,944
Oh, no!

603
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,266
Charlie.

604
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,531
Hey, Rosie. Listen.

605
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,954
We nearly done it that time,
didn't we, Rosie?

606
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,873
l wonder how much damage we've done.

607
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,333
Let's get the water out and see.

608
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:33,100
Yeah, better than we could've hoped for.
The skin seems tight enough.

609
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,310
No water coming in.

610
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,313
What was all that clattering
just before we stopped?

611
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,690
That's what we gotta find out, old girl.

612
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,525
How are you going to do that, dear?

613
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,778
l gotta go down underneath
and take a look.

614
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,740
l hope there's no fancy currents
down there.

615
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,203
Well, here goes.

616
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,727
Could you see anything, dear?

617
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:21,065
Yeah. The shaft's twisted
like a corkscrew

618
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:24,360
and there's a blade gone off the prop.

619
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,529
We'll have to mend it, then.

620
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,282
Mend it? Fat chance.

621
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,077
Why is that, dear?

622
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,539
What should we have to do
before we can go on?

623
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,040
l'll tell you.

624
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,877
l'll tell you what we could do
if we was back in the slip at Limbasi.

625
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:45,548
We could pull this old tub out
and take the shaft down

626
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:49,134
and haul it over to the workshop
and forge it straight again.

627
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,637
Then we could write to the makers
for a new prop.

628
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,013
They might even have one in stock,

629
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,891
on account of how
this boat's only 30 years old.

630
01:04:55,976 --> 01:05:00,312
Then while we was waiting, we could
clean her bottom and paint her up.

631
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,941
Then we'd put the new
shaft in and the new prop

632
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,402
and go on our way
as if nothing had happened.

633
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,404
But this ain't Limbasi.

634
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:13,993
Couldn't you straighten the shaft
without taking the boat up on shore?

635
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,787
l don't know. l might.

636
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:20,207
Means working underwater.
Could be done, maybe.

637
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:24,336
lf you could get the shaft up on shore,
could you straighten it?

638
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:29,383
l ain't got no anvil, l ain't got no hearth,
l ain't got no coal, l ain't got nothing.

639
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:34,680
l saw a Masai native working once
using charcoal on a big hollow stone.

640
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,099
He had a boy to fan the charcoal.

641
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,143
Yeah, yeah. l've seen that.

642
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:42,688
l'd use a bellows myself.
Could make one easy enough.

643
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,982
Well, if you think that would be better.

644
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:49,028
Well, lots and lots of firewood
on the bank.

645
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,948
Why don't you try it?

646
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:58,037
No, no. lt ain't no use, Rosie.

647
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,290
l was forgetting the prop.
The blade's gone.

648
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,626
Can't we go on the blades that are left?

649
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,169
No. The prop would be out of balance.

650
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:08,839
The shaft would be all twisted up
like a corkscrew again.

651
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,799
We'll have to make a new blade, then.

652
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:14,219
There's lots of iron and stuff
that you could use.

653
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,971
Yeah. Tie it on!

654
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:21,602
Well, if you think that would do,
but wouldn't it be better to weld it on?

655
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:26,106
lsn't that the right word, dear?
Weld it on?

656
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,320
You're a one, Rosie. Really, you are.

657
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,781
Well, isn't "weld" the right word, dear?

658
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:34,865
You know what l mean,

659
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,368
-even if it isn't, don't you?
-Yes.

660
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,090
l swallowed half the river that time.

661
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,509
You were down there
an awfully long time. l was scared.

662
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,470
The shaft don't seem
to want to come out. lt's stuck, like.

663
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,348
Charlie, let me help you.

664
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,849
How do you mean?
What do you think you're going to do?

665
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,851
-l'm going to go down there, too.
-Rosie, are you cracked?

666
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,978
The currents down there are fierce.

667
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,523
l don't want a drowned woman
on my hands.

668
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,483
What will you be thinking of next?

669
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,612
Well, here goes.

670
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,011
lf my old dad had put me to
blacksmithing when l was a kid,

671
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,140
l don't think
l should have ever come to Africa.

672
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,226
l might have...

673
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,187
But then l wouldn't have met you,
Rosie, old girl.

674
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,522
Charlie.

675
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,733
Now.

676
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,026
There.

677
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,237
Yeah, that's about as good
as l can get it.

678
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,030
Didn't take so long, neither.

679
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,701
The blade will be a different thing.
l gotta make that.

680
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,313
lt turns right enough,
but that don't mean nothing.

681
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:33,233
Question is, will she stand up
under a full head of steam?

682
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:36,779
Well, we'll get the answer out there,

683
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,948
but the Lord help us
if it ain't the right one.

684
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:26,578
Looks like this old river got tired
of all the running and jumping she did

685
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,248
and decided to lay down
and rest for a while.

686
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:34,378
This must be where the river
changes her name from Ulanga to Bora.

687
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,342
Pinch me, Rosie.

688
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,178
Here we are, going down the river

689
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,640
like Antony and Cleopatra
on their barge.

690
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,068
lf it hadn't been for you, this couldn't be.

691
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,280
-Don't you feel proud of yourself?
-Certainly not.

692
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,323
Look at the way
you kept the engine going.

693
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:07,202
Look at how you mended the propeller.
lt wasn't me at all.

694
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,705
l don't think there's another man alive
who could've done it.

695
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,875
Right you are, Rosie,
'cause no other man alive's got you.

696
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,002
-Charlie.
-l'll never forget the way you looked

697
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,879
going over the falls.

698
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,215
Head up, chin out,
hair blowing in the wind.

699
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,718
The living picture of a heroine.

700
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,721
Fancy me a heroine.

701
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,265
Charlie, you've lost your mind.

702
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,685
Lost my heart, too.

703
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,397
Shall we drop the anchor, sweetheart?

704
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,985
lf the river needs to rest for a while,
l suppose we do, too.

705
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,502
Rosie, l got a feeling that pretty soon

706
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,213
we're going to wish we was
back shooting the rapids.

707
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:05,135
This is awful. We gotta get out of here.

708
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,471
-We ain't got no steam.
-l'm going in.

709
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:10,599
-l'm going under the water.
-Yeah, that's it.

710
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,101
-No.
-But l'm being eaten alive!

711
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,770
What's that you said
about being eaten alive?

712
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,104
Look at that.

713
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,232
Get me out of here, Charlie!
l cannot stand it!

714
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,864
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

715
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,451
Golly! Golly! My! Hurry!

716
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:46,468
Charlie!

717
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,391
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

718
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,629
We got away from them.
You can come out now.

719
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:29,553
l'm ashamed of myself, Charlie,
acting this way,

720
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,889
but l couldn't help it. l was going mad.

721
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,976
You're so bitten.

722
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:39,730
The bites themselves ain't so bad.
lt's having them all around you.

723
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,233
l've heard of them driving buffalo
and native cattle stark-staring mad,

724
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,737
so they just run and run
till they fall down dead.

725
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,574
Will it be that way wherever we tie up?

726
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,159
Probably.

727
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,870
What are we going to do, Charlie?

728
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,165
Well, if the river keeps straight
and deep and slow,

729
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,042
there ain't nothing much can hurt us.

730
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,086
l'll let the anchor out a way.
That'll keep us out of trouble.

731
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:16,141
How much further do you suppose
it is to the lake, Charlie?

732
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,185
Well, not so many miles,
as the crow flies.

733
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,270
No telling how many days.

734
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:24,149
All depends on how much
winding around this old river does.

735
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,489
What a time we've had, Rosie.

736
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,283
What a time.

737
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,330
We'll never lack for stories
to tell our grandchildren, will we?

738
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,730
Nothing but grass and papyrus
as far as you can see.

739
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,066
Which is the main channel?

740
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,735
Don't look like there is one.

741
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,155
What are we going to do, Charlie?

742
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,740
l don't know.

743
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,454
We can't just go round
and round here forever.

744
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,958
We can't just go round and round.

745
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,004
Well, if we get in there and the grass
closes in back of the stern,

746
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,965
there's no going back, Rosie.

747
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:34,678
lf anything happens, we just sit there
till we go off our heads with fever.

748
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:36,888
l know it.

749
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,890
All right.

750
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,102
You pays your money
and you takes your choice.

751
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,064
-That way.
-Put her over.

752
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:51,046
We've come along by steam,
we've paddled and pushed

753
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,090
and pulled this old boat
along with the hook.

754
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:58,887
What we ain't done up to now
is get out and carry her.

755
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,056
Looks like that'll come next.

756
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,308
Hard to breathe, the air is so heavy.

757
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:07,062
Yeah. You can't tell it from the water,

758
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,774
or the water from the land,
for that matter.

759
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:17,155
All the channels we've lost,
all the twisting and turning we've done.

760
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,576
We may come out back
where we started, if we come out at all.

761
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:25,038
We've always followed the current,
what little there is of it.

762
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:27,249
That don't mean nothing with this river.

763
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,627
This river's crazy, crazy as l am.

764
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:35,465
-Charlie, Charlie.
-Sorry, old girl.

765
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,926
Well...

766
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:43,014
The only thing that'll put the roses
back in our cheeks is to

767
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,308
get out of these reeds.

768
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:57,612
What l said about having to get out
and carry this old boat

769
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,572
was meant to be a joke.

770
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,867
lt don't look like a joke now. Well...

771
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,170
The little beggars.

772
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:02,927
Pull them off me.

773
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,638
No, no.
The heads stay in, poison your blood.

774
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:07,932
Salt. Salt, salt.

775
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:22,947
Your legs.

776
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:42,050
lf there's anything in the world l hate,
it's leeches.

777
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,135
The filthy little devils.

778
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,189
There.

779
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,399
There, dear, there, there.

780
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,403
Fine specimen of a man l am, ain't l?

781
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,448
You're the bravest man that ever lived.

782
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,326
You just overdo, that's all.

783
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,037
What you need is a few hours' sleep.

784
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:41,711
There. Now, are you all comfortable?
Go to sleep, dear.

785
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:45,507
When you wake up,
we'll be on our way again.

786
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,717
-Rosie.
-Yes, Charlie.

787
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,137
You want to know the truth, don't you?

788
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,015
Even if we had all our strength, we...

789
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:58,269
We'd never get her off this mud.
We're finished.

790
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,605
l know it.

791
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,859
But, Rosie, l'm not one bit sorry l came.

792
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,280
What l mean is, it was worth it.

793
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,547
Dear Lord,

794
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,510
we've come to the end of ourjourney.

795
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,138
ln a little while, we will stand before you.

796
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,434
l pray for you to be merciful.

797
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:43,982
Judge us not for our weakness,
but for our love.

798
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:49,320
And open the doors of heaven
for Charlie and me.

799
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:14,776
Rosie.

800
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,694
Rosie, dear.

801
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,238
Look. We're on the lake.

802
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,742
The rain did it,

803
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:27,205
just lifted the old Queen up
and carried her over the mud.

804
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,541
We couldn't have been
100 yards from it last night.

805
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,919
Look. Look, Rosie.

806
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,886
Let's build the fire
and get the engine started

807
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,221
and go right out into the middle,

808
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,306
away from these reeds
where we can breathe.

809
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,476
Sure, sure. We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

810
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,031
This air, isn't it wonderful?

811
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,783
Yeah. lt's like...

812
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,328
l know you don't approve,
but it's like a shot of gin.

813
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:11,040
lt makes your blood race,
your face numb and your spirit soar.

814
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,668
l'm sorry l poured that gin out, Charlie.

815
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,336
Forget it, Rosie.

816
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,838
And just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

817
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,298
l'll make you another cup of tea.

818
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:28,432
You carry on more over a cup of tea
than l do over a glass of gin.

819
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,271
ls it?

820
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,566
Yes, it's the Louisa,
and she's coming right toward us.

821
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,901
She must be doing a good 12 knots.

822
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,196
We've got to make a run for it,
back to the reeds.

823
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,927
She's coming right toward us.

824
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,275
l thought for a minute they'd seen us.

825
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,028
They're going toward that island.

826
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:09,408
They'll probably anchor there
for the night and leave in the morning.

827
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,995
Don't you worry, they'll be back again.
You know how the Germans are.

828
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,123
They lays down systems
and then they sticks to them.

829
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,084
Monday, they're one place,

830
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,211
Tuesday, someplace else, and

831
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,464
then Wednesday, they'll be back here.

832
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,968
How long will it take
to get the torpedoes ready?

833
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,719
l don't know.

834
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,013
lt depends on the detonators.

835
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:33,391
We've got to devise something.

836
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,688
l know what you're thinking, Rosie.

837
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,440
You're thinking of taking the Queen
out at night

838
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,402
when the Louisa comes back,
ain't you, old girl?

839
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,822
Well, we ought to manage it.

840
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:54,286
There, that ought to work.
When we ram into it,

841
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,497
the ends of these nails
will hit the percussion caps

842
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:58,499
and shoot the bullets into the gelatin.

843
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,501
Charlie, you're wonderful.

844
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,004
Can't put them in the cylinders yet.
They're pretty tricky.

845
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,464
We'll put them in
when we're ready to start.

846
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,008
lt will be dark by then.

847
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,467
Do you think that you can do it
in the dark?

848
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,428
lt's a case of have to.

849
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,680
You're quite sure
that they will come back

850
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,515
with the Louisa, aren't you, Charlie?

851
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,017
Dead sure.

852
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:19,603
Let me see, the lake's 100 miles long,
50 miles wide.

853
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,440
Louisa does about... About 12 knots.

854
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,943
That's 120 miles a day. Yep.

855
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,280
She'll be back here tomorrow.

856
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:33,367
When she comes,
we'll be ready for her.

857
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,795
Charlie, let's make the Queen
as clean as we can,

858
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,423
scrub her decks and polish her brass.

859
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,717
Sure. She ought to look her best,

860
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,595
representing, as she does,
the Royal Navy.

861
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,772
-You know, Rosie, l've been thinking.
-Yes, Charlie?

862
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,777
Now, there ain't no use
of us both going to do it.

863
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,072
Now that l've had time to study it,
l can plainly see it's a one-man job.

864
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,282
You couldn't be more right,
Charlie dear.

865
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,159
Well now, Rosie,
l'm glad you agree with me.

866
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,369
When the time comes,
l'll put you off on the east shore.

867
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,580
You'll wait there for me
while l attend to the Louisa.

868
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,791
Certainly not.
You're the one to be put ashore.

869
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,000
-Me?
-This whole thing

870
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,878
was my idea, wasn't it?
l'm the logical one to carry it out.

871
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,964
Why, Rosie, l'm surprised at you!
You're a very sensible woman as a rule.

872
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,716
Now, we won't have any more talk
along those lines.

873
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:32,802
Now, look here, Charlie Allnut,
l can manage this boat

874
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,553
every bit as well as you can
and you know it.

875
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,597
Rosie, you're cracked.

876
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,058
Didn't l steer going down the rapids?

877
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:41,268
You steer well enough, but you
don't know nothing about the engine.

878
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,562
Suppose she broke down on you
out there? Wouldn't you look foolish?

879
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,606
Now, me,
l'd just walk back from the tiller

880
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,441
and do a thing or two to that old engine.

881
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:51,028
You know, spit on her, kick her in the
slats and she'd go right to work again.

882
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:55,032
She knows who's boss, all right,
you bet that old engine does.

883
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:59,036
-l suppose you're right.
-Well, now, that's all settled.

884
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,205
l'll dive off a second before the crash

885
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,249
and swim over to where
you'll be waiting on the east shore

886
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,875
and we'll be off to Kenya together.

887
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,837
No, l meant it may be necessary
for you to come along.

888
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,463
Come along? What do you mean?

889
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,966
Didn't we just agree
this was a one-man job?

890
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:15,636
But you convinced me that it isn't,
so now it's settled. We'll go together.

891
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,765
No, we won't.
You'll wait for me on the east shore.

892
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,184
Who do you think you are,
ordering me about?

893
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,353
l'm the captain, that's who.

894
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,647
And l ain't taking you along.
You'd only be in my way.

895
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:29,942
l suppose l was in your way
going down the rapids.

896
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,028
Then what you said to me
back there on the river was a lie

897
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:36,157
about how you never
could have done it alone

898
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:40,077
and how you'd lost your heart
and everything.

899
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:41,620
You liar.

900
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:48,085
Charlie, we're having our first quarrel.

901
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,213
Rosie.

902
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:54,675
lt's only that
l just can't bear the thought of...

903
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,511
Well, what l mean is,
suppose something should happen,

904
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,221
not that anything will, but...

905
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:01,599
Don't you understand, Charlie?

906
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:05,603
l wouldn't want to go on to Kenya
without you.

907
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:10,649
Rosie. All right.

908
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,570
lt'll be you at the tiller
and me at the engine,

909
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:17,072
just like it was from the start.

910
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:23,162
And there's the Louisa, right on time.

911
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,824
lt's blowing up a bit.
We'd better get started, all right?

912
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:08,058
Charlie. Charlie, l can't steer.
lt's hard to steer.

913
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:11,729
Too much water in the bow.
Screw's out of the water half the time.

914
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,902
We've got to get her nose up
or we'll be in trouble.

915
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,600
Rosie, we're sinking.

916
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:32,768
Rosie!

917
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:37,648
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

918
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:40,651
Rosie!

919
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,781
What is your nationality?

920
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:49,910
French? Belgian? British?

921
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,704
-Yeah.
-Yes, what?

922
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,042
-British.
-What were you doing on the island?

923
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,337
Fishing.

924
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,091
You are aware that the punishment
for giving false testimony

925
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,469
before this court is death by hanging?

926
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,096
Who cares?

927
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,682
What were you doing on the island?

928
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:15,477
-l was fishing.
-How did you get there?

929
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,938
l swam.

930
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,690
Do you know that you are in an area

931
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,109
prohibited to all
but members of the forces

932
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:25,696
of His lmperial Majesty
Kaiser Wilhelm ll?

933
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,947
Who cares?

934
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,158
You are accused of being a spy

935
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:32,244
in the service
of the British Armed Forces.

936
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:37,040
Have you anything to say that might lead
this court to believe otherwise?

937
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,334
l told you l was fishing.

938
01:36:57,896 --> 01:36:59,980
The court sentences you
to death by hanging.

939
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,858
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

940
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:22,836
Was there a woman with you?

941
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,803
Rosie. Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

942
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,931
-Charlie!
-Rosie!

943
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,226
Charlie!

944
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:41,605
Who's that woman?

945
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:45,943
-l don't know.
-You just called her by name.

946
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,153
l thought she was somebody else.

947
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:50,656
l shall hang you twice, l think.

948
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,705
-Charlie, dear.
-Rosie.

949
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,044
Who are you?

950
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,756
Miss Rose Sayer.

951
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:10,801
English?

952
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,803
Of course.

953
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:18,392
-What were you doing on the lake?
-l ain't told him nothing, Rosie.

954
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:19,810
Silence!

955
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:28,318
-What were you doing on the lake?
-We were boating.

956
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,612
Last night? ln such weather?

957
01:38:30,697 --> 01:38:33,407
We were not responsible
for the weather.

958
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:35,742
As your fellow prisoner
has already learned,

959
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,121
the penalty for not
answering this court is death.

960
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:44,042
You mean he... Charlie?
Stop that!

961
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:45,335
Order.

962
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,254
Are they going to hang you, Charlie?

963
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:51,675
FruIein Sayer, you will come to order
and answer the question of this court.

964
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,302
Very well. Ask your questions.

965
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:54,928
What were you doing on the lake?

966
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:56,722
-We came here to sink this ship.
-Rosie!

967
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,307
-And we would have, too, except...
-Rosie!

968
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,559
Let's at least have the pleasure
of telling them about it, Charlie.

969
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:01,643
Sink this ship?

970
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:04,021
Don't you believe her, Your Honor.
She's touched, you know. Fever.

971
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:05,939
Stop that, Charlie.
We've been through all that.

972
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:09,026
l'm certainly not going to outlive you,
and that's all there is to it.

973
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:13,238
And just how, FruIein, did you propose
to sink the Knigin Louise?

974
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:15,907
With torpedoes.

975
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,368
Torpedoes?

976
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,748
Will you be so good as to tell us exactly

977
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:25,959
where and how
you acquired torpedoes?

978
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:30,172
-Mr. Allnut made them.
-How very interesting.

979
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,049
You don't believe me, do you?

980
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:35,218
Charlie, tell them
how you made the torpedoes.

981
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,889
Well, l... See, what l did, l...

982
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,725
l took the heads off
two cylinders of oxygen

983
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,310
and l filled them up with live explosive.

984
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,479
You know, about two hundredweight.
That was easy enough.

985
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,481
lt was the detonators
that took some doing.

986
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:49,274
And you know what l used?

987
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,319
Cartridges and nails
and blocks of soft wood.

988
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,197
Then l took the two cylinders
and l put them in the bows

989
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:57,658
of the African Queen,
right down near the waterline,

990
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,951
so when we rammed you...

991
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,662
And where is the African Queen?

992
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:03,664
She sank in the storm.

993
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,332
But how did you get onto the lake?

994
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:09,544
We came down the Ulanga,
the Bora, you call it down here.

995
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,798
-That's impossible.
-Nevertheless.

996
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:15,384
But everyone knows
the river is unnavigable.

997
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:16,843
That may be.

998
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:19,096
We came down it, though,
didn't we, Charlie?

999
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,181
And in the African Queen.

1000
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:04,266
Would you hang us together, please?

1001
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:08,478
-Now, wait a minute. Hey, Captain.
-Yes?

1002
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:13,442
-Will you grant us a last request?
-What is it?

1003
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,486
-Marry us.
-What?

1004
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,826
We want to get married.
Ship captains can do that, can't they?

1005
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:27,205
-Yeah.
-Why, Charlie, what a lovely idea.

1006
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,750
What kind of craziness is this?

1007
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:32,961
Come on, Captain,
it'll only take a minute,

1008
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,589
and it'll mean such a lot to the lady.

1009
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:38,383
Very well, if you wish it absolutely.

1010
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,558
What are the names again?

1011
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:51,104
-Charles.
-Rosie. Rose.

1012
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:56,026
Do you, Charles, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1013
01:41:57,195 --> 01:41:58,445
Yes, sir.

1014
01:41:58,905 --> 01:42:03,074
Do you, Rose, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1015
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:04,409
l do.

1016
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:12,292
By the authority vested in me
by Kaiser Wilhelm ll,

1017
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:16,046
l pronounce you man and wife.
Proceed with the execution.

1018
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,376
Hey, what happened?

1019
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,879
We did it, Charlie! We did it!

1020
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:40,213
But how?

1021
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,636
Well, what do you think?

1022
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:50,307
You all right, Mrs. Allnut?

1023
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:54,227
Wonderful. Simply wonderful.
And you, Mr. Allnut?

1024
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:57,606
Pretty good for an old, married man.

1025
01:43:58,274 --> 01:44:02,652
l'm all twisted around, Charlie.
Which way is the east shore?

1026
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:05,363
The way we're swimming, old girl.

1027
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,782
There was a bold fisherman

1028
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:10,577
Set sail from off Pimlico

1029
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:12,913
To catch the bold picky

1030
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,415
And the gay mackerel

1031
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,001
But when he got off Pimlico

1032
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,503
The wind did begin to blow...
