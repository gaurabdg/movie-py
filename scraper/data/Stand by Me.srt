1
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,803
I was 12 going on 13
the first time I saw a dead human being.

2
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,767
It happened in the summer of 1959,

3
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,685
a long time ago,

4
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,063
but only if you measure in terms of years.

5
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,322
I was living in a small town in Oregon
called Castle Rock.

6
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,243
There were only 1,281 people,
but to me it was the whole world.

7
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,414
It's the Bossman Bob Cormier here.
It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.

8
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,666
It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.

9
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,128
Up the ladder with another platter,
it's Bobby Day with Rockin' Robin.

10
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,421
It's boss.

11
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,692
Hey, how do you know a Frenchman's been
in your backyard?

12
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,027
I'm French, okay.

13
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,155
Your garbage cans are empty
and your dog's pregnant.

14
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,116
Didn't I just say I was French?

15
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,327
-I knock.
-Shit.

16
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,037
Twenty-nine.

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,413
Twenty-two.

18
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,915
Piss up a rope.

19
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,171
Gordie's out, Ole' Gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door.

20
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,800
Come on, man, deal.

21
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,845
Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy
we hung around with.

22
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,013
He didn't have much of a chance in life.

23
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,266
His dad was given to fits of rage.

24
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,103
One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove
and almost burned it off.

25
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,438
I knock.

26
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,191
You four-eyed pile of shit.

27
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,694
The "pile of shit" has 1,000 eyes.

28
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,989
What?

29
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,700
What's so funny? Come on.
I've got 30, what have you got?

30
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,993
Sixteen.

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,661
Go ahead, keep laughing.

32
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,746
You're down to your ride, pal.

33
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,083
Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang
and my best friend.

34
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,004
He came from a bad family
and everyone just knew he'd turn out bad.

35
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,630
Including Chris.

36
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,217
That's not the secret knock.

37
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,469
I forget the secret knock. Let me in.

38
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,721
Vern.

39
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,599
Come on, you guys, open up.

40
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,811
Oh, man, you guys are not gonna
believe this. This is so boss.

41
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,356
Oh, man, wait till you hear this.

42
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,942
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

43
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,321
Let me catch my breath.
I ran all the way from my house.

44
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,698
I ran all the way home

45
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,742
Come on. You guys, listen to me,
'cause this is boss.

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,161
Just to say I'm sorry

47
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,497
Okay, forget it.
I don't have to tell you nothing.

48
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,917
Hold on, you guys. Hold on.
What is it, man?

49
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,252
Okay, great,
you won't believe this, sincerely.

50
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,254
I ran all the way home

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,757
Screw you guys. Forget it.

52
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,258
What is it?

53
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,885
Can you guys camp out tonight?

54
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,930
I mean, if you tell your folks
we're gonna tent out in my back field?

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,514
Yeah, I think so.

56
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,435
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak.
He's been drinking a lot lately.

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,855
You got to, man. Sincerely,
you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

58
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,190
Yeah, probably.

59
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,193
So what are you pissing and moaning
about, Verno?

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,611
-I knock.
-What?

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,197
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

62
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,449
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

63
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,618
Make your draw, shitheap.

64
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,372
You guys want to go see a dead body?

65
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,461
Well, I was under the porch digging,
you know?

66
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,756
We all understood
what Vern meant right away.

67
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,468
At the beginning of the school year
he had buried a quart jar of pennies

68
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,136
underneath his house.

69
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,889
He drew a treasure map
so he could find them again.

70
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:11,185
A week later, his mom cleaned out
his room and threw away the map.

71
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,939
Vern had been trying to find those pennies
for nine months.

72
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,565
Nine months, man.

73
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,068
You didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,363
Jesus Christ, Billy. We gotta do something.

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,407
Why? Who cares?

76
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,367
-We saw him.
-So?

77
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,745
It ain't nothing to us. The kid's dead
so it ain't nothing to him, neither.

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,873
And who gives a shit if they ever find him?
I don't.

79
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,377
But it's that kid they were talking about
on the radio.

80
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,797
Brocker or Brower or Flowers,
whatever his name is.

81
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,466
The train must have hit him.

82
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,468
Big fucking deal.

83
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,847
We had all followed
the Ray Brower story very closely,

84
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,598
because he was a kid our age.

85
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,644
Three days before, he'd gone out to pick
blueberries and nobody had seen him since.

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,521
I think we should tell the cops.

87
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,816
You don't go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car, you idiot.

88
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,069
They're gonna want to know how the hell
we got way out on Back Harlow Road.

89
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,696
Now they know we don't got no car.

90
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,449
It's best we just keep our mouth shut,
and then they can't touch us.

91
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,784
Look, we could make an anonymous call.

92
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,998
They trace those calls, stupid.
I seen it on Highway Patrol and on Dragnet.

93
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,332
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,294
I just wish we never boosted
that goddamned Dodge.

95
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,630
I wish Ace had been with us.
We could've told the cops we was in his car.

96
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,757
Well, he wasn't!

97
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,676
-Are we gonna tell him?
-We're not gonna tell nobody.

98
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,636
Nobody, never. You dig me?

99
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,638
I know the Back Harlow Road.

100
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,976
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.
The train tracks are right there.

101
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,145
Me and my dad used to fish for Cossies
out there.

102
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,897
Jesus Christ, man,
if they would have known you

103
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,231
were under there, they would've killed you.

104
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,194
Could he have gotten all the way from
Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

105
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,322
Sure. He must have started walking
on the train tracks

106
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,240
and just followed them the whole way.

107
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,201
Yeah. Yeah, right.

108
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:54,371
And then after dark, a train must have
come along and...el smacko.

109
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah.

110
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,169
Hey. Hey, you guys,

111
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,714
I bet you anything that if we find him,
we'll get our pictures in the paper.

112
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,258
-Yeah, we could even be on TV.
-Sure.

113
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,052
-We'll be heroes.
-Yeah.

114
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,721
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

115
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,225
He's not gonna care.
'Cause it's gonna be us guys that find him.

116
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,727
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan,
and the boosted car.

117
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,021
They'll probably pin a medal on you, Vern.

118
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,065
Yeah, you think so?

119
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,316
Sure.

120
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,360
What'll we tell our folks?

121
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,112
Exactly what you said.

122
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,198
We'll all tell our folks
we're tenting out in your back field.

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,575
You tell your folks
you're sleeping over at Teddy's.

124
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,370
Then we say we're going over
to the drag races the next day.

125
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,539
We're rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night.

126
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,707
Man, that's a plan-and-a-half.

127
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,460
But if we do find that kid's body
over in South Harlow,

128
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,255
they'll know we didn't go to the drag races.
We'll get hided.

129
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,881
Nobody will care

130
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,717
because everybody's gonna be so jazzed
about what we found

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,511
-it's not gonna make a difference.
-Yeah.

132
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,055
My dad will hide me anyway,
but hell, it's worth a hiding.

133
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,224
-Shit, yeah.
-Let's do it. What do you say?

134
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,642
-All right.
-Gordie?

135
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,768
Sure.

136
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,019
Vern?

137
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,479
I don't know.

138
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,814
Vern.

139
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,440
Come on, Verno.

140
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,734
Vern.

141
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,487
-Come on, Verno.
-Come on, Verno.

142
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,656
-Okay.
-All right.

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,784
Too cool, too cool! Very cool!
Very, very cool! Yes!

144
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,079
I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm,
but I couldn't.

145
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,084
That summer at home,
I had become the Invisible Boy.

146
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,964
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

147
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,427
Mom?

148
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,599
It's in Denny's room.

149
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,272
In April, my older brother, Dennis,
had been killed in a jeep accident.

150
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,607
Four months had passed,

151
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,111
but my parents still hadn't been able
to put the pieces back together again.

152
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,151
Gordie, I got something for you.

153
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,447
This, my friend, is for you.

154
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,535
-But, Denny, this is your Yankee cap.
-No, this is your Yankee cap.

155
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,497
It's a good-luck cap. You wear that cap you
know how many fish we're gonna catch?

156
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,165
-How much?
-A bazillion.

157
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,919
A bazillion fish. And it looks good
on you, too. Just like that.

158
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,420
Hey, Moe, I'm going blind.

159
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,799
Don't start with me, porcupine.
Come here, give me a hug.

160
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,760
You found it.

161
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,847
You found it.

162
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,766
Yeah.

163
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,817
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?

164
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,652
Dad, they're okay.

165
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,238
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

166
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,323
Chris isn't a thief.

167
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,617
He stole the milk money at school.

168
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,786
He's a thief in my book.

169
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:42,766
It was almost noon as we set out to find
the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.

170
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,978
Right here's cool.

171
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,564
Hey, Chris.

172
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,817
-Thanks a lot.
-Sure thing.

173
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,402
-Gordo.
-Hey, man.

174
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,031
-You want to see something?
-Sure. What?

175
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,824
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

176
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,492
-Come on, man.
-What is it?

177
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,829
-Man, you've got to see this.
-Come on, man. What is it?

178
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
Come on, what is it?

179
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,884
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

180
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,595
Walking, talking Jesus!

181
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,724
-Where'd you get this?
-Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

182
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,351
It's a .45.

183
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,769
I can see that.

184
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,275
-You got shells for it?
-Yeah.

185
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,194
I took all that was left in the box.

186
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,615
My dad'll think that he used them himself
shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

187
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,744
-Is it loaded?
-Hell, no. What do you think I am?

188
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,705
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

189
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,874
Let's get out of here! Come on!

190
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,837
Gordie did it! Gordie Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock!

191
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,005
Shut up!

192
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,425
Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?

193
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,972
Oh, man, you should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

194
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,101
-That was really fine.
-You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

195
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,812
I'm gonna be in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

196
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,146
Shit, Gordie,
she thought it was firecrackers.

197
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,399
I don't care. That was a mean trick, Chris.

198
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,691
Hey, Gordie...

199
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,986
I didn't know it was loaded.

200
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,614
-Honest.
-You swear?

201
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,950
Yeah, I swear.

202
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,411
-On your mother's name?
-Yeah.

203
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,830
Even if she goes to hell 'cause you lied?

204
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,498
Yeah, I swear.

205
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,376
Pinkie swear?

206
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,712
Pinkie swear.

207
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,679
Hey, girls, where you going?

208
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,389
Hey, come on, man.
My brother gave me that!

209
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,433
And now you're giving it to me.

210
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,311
Give it to me! Come on, man, that's mine!

211
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,565
You're a real asshole, you know that?

212
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,987
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

213
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,447
Now, Christopher,

214
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,533
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

215
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,244
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

216
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,415
That's why I'm gonna give him
the opportunity of taking it back.

217
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,336
-Shit.
-Take it back, kid.

218
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,756
-Come on, man, stop it, you're hurting him.
-You bastard! Let go, man.

219
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,342
-Stop it, man! Cut it out!
-Take it back, kid.

220
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,761
-Cut it out!
-Take it back.

221
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,890
You big... Okay, okay, I take it back.
I take it back.

222
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,561
There.

223
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,355
Now I feel a whole lot better about this.

224
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,858
How about you?

225
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,236
Good.

226
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,866
See you later, girls.

227
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,546
Come on, just forget them.

228
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,937
What do we need a pistol for, anyway?

229
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,649
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

230
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,442
Or a garbage can.

231
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,697
I brought a comb.

232
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,533
What do we need a comb for?

233
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,952
Well, if we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

234
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,120
-That's a lot of thinking, Vern.
-Thanks.

235
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,747
Two for flinching.

236
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,588
How far do you think it's gonna be?

237
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,927
If we follow the tracks all the way
into Harlow, it'll be about 20 miles.

238
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,720
Sound about right to you, Gordie?

239
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,973
Yeah, it might even be 30.

240
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,475
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

241
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,853
-No way, that sucks.
-Why not?

242
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,398
We could go out to Route 7
to the Shiloh Church,

243
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,985
then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

244
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,152
That's pussy.

245
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,154
Hey, it's a long ways.

246
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,283
Did your mother ever have any kids
that lived?

247
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,993
What do you mean?

248
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,690
We have to fill up at the junkyard.
My dad said it's a safe well.

249
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,319
-Not if Chopper's there.
-If Chopper's there we'll send you in.

250
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,653
Ha, ha. Very funny.

251
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,327
Hey, I'm kind of hungry.
Who's got the food?

252
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,913
Oh, shit! Did anybody bring anything?

253
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,042
Not me. Gordie?

254
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,504
This is great. What are we supposed to do?
Eat our feet?

255
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,798
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

256
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,469
Shit. This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's idea.
Why didn't you bring something?

257
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,971
What am I supposed to do?
Think of everything? I brought the comb.

258
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,139
Oh, great, you brought the comb.

259
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,141
What do you need a comb for?
You don't even have any hair.

260
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,851
I brought it for you guys, when we get there.

261
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,227
Hey, hey, hey!

262
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,563
Let's see, how much money have we got?

263
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,234
Yeah, I got $1 .02.

264
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,572
And 68 cents from Chris.

265
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,408
Sixty cents from Teddy.

266
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,916
Seven cents, Vern?

267
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,794
I haven't found my pennies yet.

268
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,588
Well, $2.37 is not bad.

269
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,342
Quidacioluo's is at the end of that little road
that goes by the junkyard.

270
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,260
I think we can get some stuff there.

271
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,470
Train coming.

272
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,684
Geronimo!

273
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,564
-Come on, Teddy.
-No.

274
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,192
I'm gonna dodge it.

275
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,988
Come on, Teddy, man. Get off the tracks.
You're crazy.

276
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,741
Train dodge. Dig it?

277
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,208
Get the hell off the tracks, Teddy.
You want to get yourself killed?

278
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,544
Just like the beach at Normandy.

279
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,134
-Come on, man. Come on.
-No, no!

280
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,397
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

281
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,982
You son of a bitch!

282
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,192
I was just trying to save your life, man.

283
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,404
You want to kill yourself?
Is that what you want, God damn it?

284
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,656
You tried to kill yourself.

285
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,831
I don't need no babysitter.

286
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,666
You do, too.

287
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,965
Skin it.

288
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,010
I could have dodged it.

289
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,181
Listen, Teddy,
you can dodge it on the way back, man.

290
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,516
Peace.

291
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,852
Skin it.

292
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,132
About this time, Charlie and Billy
were playing mailbox baseball

293
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,218
with Ace and Eyeball.

294
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,095
Shit, I'm out. God damn it!

295
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,807
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

296
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,102
Why don't you tell me something
I don't know, asshole?

297
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,813
Billy, you're up.

298
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,190
You guys win. I don't want to play no more.

299
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,983
You can't quit.

300
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,904
We only played three innings.
That'd be a non-official game.

301
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,365
Hey, Ace, me and...

302
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,995
What's with you homos?
You've been acting psycho all day.

303
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,207
What is it?

304
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,584
It's nothing. Nothing. It's nothing, right?

305
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,712
Then if you gentlemen don't mind,
I'd like to finish this game

306
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,715
before I start collecting
my goddamned Social Security, okay?

307
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,843
You're up, Billy. Move it.

308
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,136
All right, give me this fucking stick.

309
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,888
Let's play ball.

310
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,142
Foul ball.

311
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,743
Hey, Vern, looks like
your ma's been out driving again.

312
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,954
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

313
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,498
Stand back, men!

314
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,043
Paratroopers, over the side!

315
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,590
"No Trespassing" was enforced
by Milo Pressman, the junkman

316
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,091
and his dog, Chopper.

317
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,012
The most feared and least seen dog
in Castle Rock.

318
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,807
Legend had it that
Milo had trained Chopper not just to sic,

319
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,352
but to sic specific parts
of the human anatomy.

320
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,106
Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled
the junkyard fence

321
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,611
might hear the dread cry,
"Chopper, sic balls!"

322
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,155
But right now neither the dread Chopper
nor Milo

323
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,990
was anywhere in sight.

324
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,744
Teddy's crazy.

325
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,538
Where's the B.A.R.?
Come on, men, move it out!

326
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,999
Yeah. He won't live to be 20, I bet.

327
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,960
Remember the time you saved him
in the tree?

328
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,253
Yeah.

329
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,589
You know, I dream about that sometimes.

330
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,759
Except in the dream I always miss him.

331
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,511
I just get a couple of his hairs
and down he goes.

332
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,804
It's weird.

333
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,765
Yeah, that is weird.

334
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,475
But you didn't miss him.

335
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,852
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

336
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,855
Not even when
the ladies leave the seat down.

337
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:15,982
Hey, I'll race you.

338
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,610
-No, I don't think so.
-Right to the pump, man. Come on.

339
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,238
-I'm kind of tired. Go!
-You're a dead man, Lachance!

340
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,950
It looks like Lachance has got him this time.

341
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,534
He's got Chambers beat.

342
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,120
But what's this?
Chambers is making his move.

343
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,665
Lachance is fading
and it's Chambers at the tape.

344
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,583
The crowd goes wild.

345
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,055
A 12-pointer.

346
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,439
Hey, you guys been watching
The Mickey Mouse Club lately?

347
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,524
Yeah.

348
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,651
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

349
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,152
-You think so?
-Yeah, I think so.

350
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,487
Yeah, I think he's right.

351
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,492
I've been noticing lately that the A and the E
are starting to bend around the sides.

352
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,830
-Annette's tits are great.
-Yeah.

353
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,332
This is really a good time.

354
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,583
The most.

355
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,918
A blast.

356
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,338
Vern didn't just mean being off limits
inside the junkyard

357
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,257
or fudging on our folks

358
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,177
or going on a hike up the railroad tracks
to Harlow. He meant those things, but

359
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,889
it seems to me now it was more
and that we all knew it.

360
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,142
Everything was there and around us.

361
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,104
We knew exactly who we were
and exactly where we were going.

362
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,981
It was grand.

363
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,071
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

364
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,115
What time is it, Gordie?

365
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,909
It's 1:15.

366
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,996
We'd better go get the food.
Junkyard opens at 3:00.

367
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,622
Chopper'll be here.

368
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,124
Sic balls.

369
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,586
You go.
You could pick us up on the way back.

370
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,671
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

371
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,799
-I'm staying right here.
-Yeah, man, I'm not going.

372
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,094
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

373
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,471
Okay.

374
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,222
Odd man goes.

375
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,099
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

376
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,893
Flip or eat lead.

377
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,192
Four tails.

378
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,527
Oh, Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

379
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,654
-Come on, Vern.
-That doesn't mean anything.

380
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,781
No, let's go again.

381
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,033
No, man, a goocher. That's really bad.

382
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,243
You remember when Clint Bracken
and those guys

383
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,579
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

384
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,040
Billy told me they were flipping for beers

385
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,918
and they came up with a goocher
just before they got into the car.

386
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,504
And, bang! They all got totaled.

387
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,256
I don't like this. Sincerely.

388
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,260
Verno, nobody believes that crap
about moons and goochers.

389
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,263
It's baby stuff. Now come on, flip again.

390
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,602
You gonna flip or not?

391
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,604
Come on, Vern, we don't have all day.

392
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,068
You lose, Gordie.

393
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,612
Gordie loses.

394
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,240
Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

395
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,160
Does the word "retarded"
mean anything to you?

396
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,663
Gordie, go get the provisions,
you morphadite.

397
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,332
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

398
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,459
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

399
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,836
Shut up.

400
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,048
I don't shut up, I grow up.
And when I look at you, I throw up.

401
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,219
And then your mother goes
around the corner and she licks it up.

402
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,725
Finding new and preferably disgusting ways
to degrade a friend's mother

403
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,061
was always held in high regard.

404
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,201
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

405
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,537
Yes, sir.

406
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,915
Shame what happened to him.

407
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,253
The Bible says,
"In the midst of life we are in death."

408
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,046
Did you know that?

409
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,717
I lost a brother in Korea.

410
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,762
You look like your brother Denny.

411
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,598
People ever tell you that?

412
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,558
Sometimes.

413
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,272
I remember the year he was All-Conference.

414
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,232
Quarterback, he played.

415
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,776
Boy, could he throw.

416
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,696
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

417
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,287
Could be some scouts
at the game tomorrow.

418
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,040
-I don't know, Pop.
-Dad, could I have the potatoes?

419
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,877
-That's what I hear, Son.
-Are you going to see Jane after the game?

420
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,545
I think she's a lovely girl.

421
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,549
-Dad, may I please have the potatoes?
-Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

422
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:55,929
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his life.

423
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:00,558
-Dennis, when you're out there tomorrow...
-Pop, did you read the story Gordie wrote?

424
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,935
Gordie wrote a story.

425
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,479
-It was really good.
-What did you write, sweetheart?

426
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,483
Now, see, that's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

427
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,028
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

428
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,696
Gordie, I really liked it.

429
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,741
-I thought it was great.
-I don't want you interrupting me.

430
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,827
Now you see I'm talking to the boy,
don't you?

431
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,914
You play football?

432
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,499
Hmm?

433
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,542
Do you play football?

434
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,837
No.

435
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,839
What do you do?

436
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,635
I don't know.

437
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,013
Yeah, well, your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

438
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,229
Here you go, kid. $1 .50 of hamburger.

439
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,303
Hey, you, kid! What are you doing there?
Come over here!

440
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,598
You, come back here, God damn it!
I'll sic my dog on you.

441
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,310
Run, Gordie, run! Run, Gordie!

442
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,645
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

443
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,897
Now, he said, "Sic him, boy."

444
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,234
But what I heard was, "Chopper, sic balls."

445
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,501
That's Chopper?

446
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,964
Chopper was my first lesson in the vast
difference between myth and reality.

447
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,302
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.
Choppie. Kiss my ass.

448
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,179
Come on, bite shit.

449
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,516
Go on, Choppie. Sic balls, Choppie.

450
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,437
You kids, stop teasing that dog!
You hear me? Stop teasing him!

451
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,523
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass,
teasing my dog like that!

452
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,360
Yeah, I'd like to see you try and climb over
this fence and get me, fat ass!

453
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,028
Don't you call me that!

454
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,114
You little tin-weasel
peckerwood loony's son!

455
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,368
What did you call me?

456
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,621
I know who you are. You're Teddy Duchamp.

457
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,206
Your dad's a loony.

458
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,833
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

459
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:34,462
He took your ear and he put it to a stove
and he burned it off.

460
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,131
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

461
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,677
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are,

462
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,805
with a loony for a father.

463
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,974
You call my dad a loony again
and I'll kill you.

464
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,851
Loony, loony, loony.

465
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,897
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

466
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,149
No, I'm gonna kill him!

467
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,860
You come on and try it,
you little slimy bastard.

468
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,196
He wants you to go over there
so he can beat the piss out of you

469
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
and then take you to the cops.

470
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,075
You watch your mouth, smart guy.
Let him do his own fighting.

471
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,578
Sure, you only outweigh him
by 500 pounds, fat ass.

472
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,038
I know your name.

473
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,708
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

474
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,670
And all your fathers are gonna
get a call from me.

475
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,548
Except for the loony up in Togus.

476
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,884
-Come on, man.
-I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

477
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,346
-Get him away from that man.
-You little foul-mouthed whoremaster.

478
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,848
You son of a bitch!

479
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,516
You come back here.

480
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,809
Come back here, you hear me?

481
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,019
-Nobody ranks out my old man.
-Come back here.

482
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:35,148
-My father stormed the beach at Normandy.
-I said come back here!

483
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,484
-He stormed the beach, you faggot!
-Come back here.

484
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,079
We showed him.
Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

485
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,915
He ranked my old man.

486
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,794
I wondered how Teddy could care so much
for his dad who'd practically killed him

487
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,880
and I couldn't give a shit about my own dad

488
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,215
who hadn't laid a hand on me
since I was three.

489
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,301
And that was for eating bleach
under the sink.

490
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,386
He ranked my old man.

491
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,599
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit
like him says about your dad?

492
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,435
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

493
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,644
Yeah, forget it.

494
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,147
Do you think that pile of shit
was at Normandy?

495
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,356
Forget it, all right?

496
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,026
He don't know nothing about your old man.
He's just dog shit.

497
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,196
Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

498
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,156
Forget it, all right? Just forget it!

499
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,772
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling
everybody's good time.

500
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,275
It's okay, man. It's okay.

501
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

502
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,491
-You saying you want to go back?
-No.

503
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,788
But going to see a dead kid,
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

504
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,666
Yeah,

505
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,045
like if he's really bad, like all cut up
and blood and shit all over him,

506
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,548
-I might have nightmares.
-Come on, Vern.

507
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,384
You know, like all guts and eyeballs
all ready to jump and grab...

508
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,511
-Shut up, Vern. God damn it!
-Come on, Vern.

509
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,971
I can't help it.

510
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,473
Sorry.

511
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,436
It was only 2:45, but it felt much later.

512
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,273
It was too hot and too much had happened.

513
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,942
We weren't even close
to the Royal River yet.

514
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,986
We were gonna have to get moving

515
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,822
if we were gonna make some real miles
before dark.

516
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,290
Hold still, will you?

517
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:07,216
So, what's with you
and this Connie Palermo chick?

518
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,804
I've been seeing her for over a month now,
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

519
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,016
She's a Catholic, man. They're all like that.

520
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,019
You want to get laid
you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

521
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,938
A Jew's good.

522
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,024
A KLAM newsbreak.

523
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,943
We interrupt to bring you an update
on the search for

524
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,653
the missing 12-year-old Ray Brower.

525
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,239
The police have expanded their efforts
to include Motton,

526
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,158
Durham and the outlying areas.

527
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,909
Shit, when are they gonna give up?

528
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,078
The kid's gone.
They're never gonna find him.

529
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,122
Not where they're looking.

530
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,666
Hey, I was right, Charlie,
they ain't never gonna find him.

531
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,919
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

532
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,422
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

533
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,217
Ten years from now, some hunter's
gonna go in the woods to take a leak,

534
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,511
wind up pissing on his bones.

535
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,930
I bet you $1,000 they find him before that.

536
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,058
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

537
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,935
-Well, asshole...
-Hey, what's the big deal?

538
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,938
-Who cares?
-Would you two just shut the fuck up?

539
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,859
If either one of you assholes had $2,000,
I'd kill you both.

540
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,737
We're back here with
The Bossman, Bob Cormier.

541
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,114
From the racks and stacks,
it's the best on wax.

542
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,742
It's the Chordettes, with Lollipop.

543
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,186
Hey, I got some Winstons.

544
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,355
Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

545
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,440
One apiece for after supper.

546
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,442
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Yeah.

547
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,987
That's when a cigarette tastes best,
after supper.

548
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,155
Right.

549
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,997
Do you think I'm weird?

550
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,083
-Definitely.
-No, man, seriously.

551
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,293
Am I weird?

552
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,797
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

553
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,099
You ready for school?

554
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,225
No.

555
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,476
Junior high.

556
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,396
You know what that means.

557
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,815
By next June we'll all be split up.

558
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,401
What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

559
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,654
'Cause it's not gonna be like
grammar school, that's why.

560
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,490
You'll be taking your college courses,
and me, Teddy and Vern,

561
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,076
we'll all be in the shop courses
with the rest of the retards

562
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,162
making ashtrays and birdhouses.

563
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,168
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.
Smart guys.

564
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,421
-Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
-No, man.

565
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,590
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

566
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,967
I'm not going in with a lot of pussies,
forget it.

567
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,093
Well, then you're an asshole.

568
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,679
What's asshole about wanting
to be with your friends?

569
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,890
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.

570
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,810
You hang with us, you'll just be
another wise guy with shit for brains.

571
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,480
You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

572
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,857
-What are you, cracked?
-Why not?

573
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,235
I saw the other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

574
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,237
Boy, you don't know nothing.

575
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,198
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

576
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:21,368
Superman is a real guy.
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

577
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,538
Yeah, maybe you're right.

578
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,750
Would be a good fight, though.

579
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,422
I mean,
you could be a real writer someday, Gordie.

580
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,758
Fuck writing! I don't want to be a writer.

581
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,345
-It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
-That's your dad talking.

582
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,305
-Bullshit!
-Bulltrue!

583
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,308
I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't give a shit about you.

584
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,270
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

585
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,903
You're just a kid, Gordie.

586
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,655
Oh, gee thanks, Dad.

587
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,825
I wish the hell I was your dad.

588
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:05,830
You wouldn't be going around talking about
taking these stupid shop courses if I was.

589
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:11,126
It's like God gave you something, man,
all those stories that you can make up,

590
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,630
and He said, "This is what we got
for you, kid. Try not to lose it."

591
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,259
But kids lose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

592
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,971
And if your parents are too fucked-up
to do it, then maybe I should.

593
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,140
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

594
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,686
Yeah, by the time we get there
the kid won't even be dead anymore.

595
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,151
Any of you guys know
when the next train is due?

596
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,070
We could go down to the Route 136 bridge.

597
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,240
What? Are you crazy?
That's five miles down the river.

598
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,660
You walk five miles down the river,
you gotta walk five miles back.

599
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,245
That could take till dark.

600
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,832
We go across here, we can get
to the same place in 10 minutes.

601
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,752
Yeah, but if a train comes,
there's nowheres to go.

602
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,087
Hell, there isn't. You just jump.

603
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,632
-Teddy, it's 100 feet.
-Yeah, Teddy.

604
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,093
Look, you guys can go around
if you want to.

605
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,470
I'm crossing here.

606
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,014
And while you guys
are dragging your candy asses

607
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,560
half-way across the state and back,
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

608
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,562
relaxing with my thoughts.

609
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,566
You use your left hand
or your right hand for that?

610
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,401
You wish.

611
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,636
I lost the comb.

612
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,805
Forget it, Vern.

613
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,136
Train!

614
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,183
Oh, shit!

615
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,810
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

616
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,771
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

617
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,774
Get up! Move it!

618
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,859
Shit, Vern!

619
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,196
-Get up, man!
-I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

620
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,283
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

621
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,118
Go.

622
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,087
-Vern, you gotta go faster!
-I can't, Gordie!

623
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,176
Run!

624
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,683
Run. Run, man! Move your ass, man!

625
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,186
Move it!

626
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,188
Faster! Run! Go!

627
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,026
-Run, God damn it, run!
-Run, run, run!

628
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,195
Faster!

629
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,679
Hey, at least now we know
when the next train was due.

630
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:26,567
Man, that was the all-time train dodge.
Too cool.

631
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,944
Vern, you were so scared

632
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,156
you looked like that fat guy in Abbott and
Costello, when he saw the mummy.

633
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,074
I wasn't that scared.

634
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,244
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

635
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,912
Okay, then you won't mind if we
check the seat of

636
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,998
your Jockeys for Hershey squirts, will you?

637
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,499
Go screw.

638
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,293
Hey, Vern, you'd better turn yours over.

639
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,670
-This is the way I like to do it.
-Fine.

640
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,881
Oh, man! Oh, no, man!

641
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,507
You got any more, Gordie?

642
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,675
Sorry, Vern.

643
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,011
This is not funny.
What am I supposed to eat?

644
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,181
-Why don't you cook your dick?
-It'd be a small meal.

645
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,270
Screw you guys, I got it.

646
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,454
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

647
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,082
Yeah, I cherish these moments.

648
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,005
What? What did I say?

649
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,429
Hey, Gordo, why don't you tell us a story?

650
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,764
I don't know.

651
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,099
-Oh, come on.
-Yeah, come on, Gordo.

652
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,977
But not one of your horror stories, okay?

653
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,397
I don't want to hear no horror stories.
I'm not up for that, man.

654
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,109
Why don't you tell us one about Sergeant
Steele and his battling leathernecks?

655
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,446
Well, the one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

656
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,490
It's about this pie-eating contest.

657
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,994
The main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody likes, named Davie Hogan.

658
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,914
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.

659
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,290
Good, Vern.

660
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,918
Go on, Gordie.

661
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:12,422
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat.
Real fat.

662
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:17,344
He weighs close to 180, but, you know,
it's not his fault. It's his glands.

663
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,138
Oh, yeah, my cousin's like that. Sincerely.

664
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:24,476
She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed
to be a "hyboid" gland or something.

665
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,896
I don't know about any "hyboid" gland,
but what a blimp!

666
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,816
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

667
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,568
-And, you know, this one time...
-Will you shut up, Vern?

668
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,697
Yeah, right. Go on, Gordie. It's a swell story.

669
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:42,369
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie,
they call him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

670
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,956
Even his little brother
and sister call him Lardass.

671
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,002
At school they put this sticker on his back
that says, "Wide Load."

672
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:54,047
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

673
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,341
But one day he gets an idea.

674
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:02,139
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.

675
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,768
-Is this thing on? Can you hear me?
-Yeah!

676
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,690
Now, the next contestant
in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat

677
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,359
Principal John Wiggins.

678
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:26,663
And our celebrity contestant,
from KLAM in Portland,

679
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,584
The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!

680
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,838
Thanks, man.

681
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,299
Hey, from the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax.

682
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,384
How about another double, golden oldie,
twin-spin sound sandwich

683
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,428
from KLAM in Portland?

684
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,847
-It's...
-Boss!

685
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,146
Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat,
but one we expect

686
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:55,776
great things from in the future,
young master David Hogan.

687
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,701
-Are you all right, young man?
-Hey, Lardass, how was your trip?

688
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,497
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

689
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,666
Don't even think about winning this.

690
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,461
Boy, are you fat.

691
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:20,050
Don't pay attention to those fools, Lardass.
I mean, Davie.

692
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,358
And now,
the one you've all been waiting for.

693
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:41,029
The four-time champion,
our own Bill Travis.

694
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,913
Listen I got $1 0 riding
on you myself, Billy Boy.

695
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,667
All right. Are you ready?

696
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,170
Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.

697
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,005
Drum roll.

698
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:03,135
Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.

699
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,681
Go.

700
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,689
Done!

701
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,535
Done!

702
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,498
Done!

703
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:36,877
Done!

704
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,631
You better pace yourself,
if you want to hold out, boy.

705
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,008
Come on, Lardass!

706
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:48,472
-Lardass!
-Lardass!

707
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,647
What the audience didn't know,

708
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,817
was that Lardass
wasn't really interested in winning.

709
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,736
What he wanted was revenge.

710
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:07,491
And right before he was introduced,
he'd gotten ready for it.

711
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,869
Principal John Wiggins.

712
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:23,256
And our celebrity contestant
from KLAM in Portland,

713
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,594
The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!

714
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,100
Hey, from the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax.

715
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,394
How about another double, golden oldie,
twin-spin sound sandwich

716
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,271
from KLAM in Portland?

717
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,439
It's...

718
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,607
Done.

719
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,864
Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began
to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.

720
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,408
He pretended he was eating cow flops

721
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,702
and rat guts in blueberry sauce.

722
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,621
Done.

723
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,706
-Lardass!
-Lardass!

724
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,962
Slowly, a sound started to build
in Lardass' stomach.

725
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,632
A strange and scary sound,

726
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,469
like a log truck coming
at you at 100 miles an hour.

727
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,027
Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth

728
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,281
and before Bill Travis knew it

729
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,201
he was covered with five pies worth
of used blueberries.

730
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,288
The women in the audience screamed.

731
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,416
Bossman Bob Cormier took one look
at Bill Travis

732
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,042
and barfed on Principal Wiggins.

733
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,547
Principal Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack
that was sitting next to him.

734
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,174
Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits!

735
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,011
But when the smell hit the crowd

736
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,681
that's when Lardass' plan
really started to work.

737
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,683
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

738
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,518
Kids barfed on their parents.

739
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,312
A fat lady barfed in her purse.

740
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,606
The Donelley twins barfed on each other.

741
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,527
And the Women's Auxiliary barfed all over
the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.

742
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,364
And Lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he'd created.

743
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:17,203
A complete and total barf-o-rama.

744
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,589
-Too cool! Too cool!
-Man, that was the best, just the best.

745
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,966
-Yeah.
-Then what happened?

746
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,259
What do you mean?

747
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,094
I mean, what happened?

748
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,432
What do you mean, "What happened?"
That's the end.

749
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:42,270
How can that be the end? What kind of an
ending is that? What happened to Lardass?

750
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:43,688
I don't know.

751
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:47,192
Maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers.

752
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,111
Jeez, that ending sucks.

753
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:54,240
Why don't you make it
so that Lardass goes home

754
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,825
and he shoots his father?

755
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,746
Then he runs away and he joins
the Texas Rangers. How about that?

756
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,206
I don't know.

757
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,333
Something good like that.

758
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,711
I like the ending.
The barfing was really good.

759
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,964
But there's one thing I didn't understand.

760
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,344
Did Lardass have to pay
to get into the contest?

761
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,098
No, Vern, they just let him in.

762
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,685
Oh, great, great story.

763
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,437
Yeah, it's a great story, Gordie.
I just didn't like the ending.

764
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,399
Hey, Verno, where's the radio?
Let's see if we can get some sounds.

765
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,566
Here.

766
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,702
We talked into the night.

767
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,580
The kind of talk that seemed important
until you discover girls.

768
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,124
All right. All right.

769
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,420
Mickey's a mouse. Donald's a duck.
Pluto's a dog.

770
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,672
What's Goofy?

771
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,134
If I could only have one food
for the rest of my life?

772
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,302
That's easy. Pez.

773
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,723
Cherry-flavored Pez. No question about it.

774
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,643
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

775
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,356
I knew The $64,000 Question was fixed.

776
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,776
There's no way anybody could know
that much about opera.

777
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:16,156
He can't be a dog.
He wears a hat and drives a car.

778
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,659
Wagon Train is a really cool show,

779
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:23,079
but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere?

780
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,415
They just keep wagon training.

781
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,418
God, that's weird.

782
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,712
What the hell is Goofy?

783
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:37,385
Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower,
but we were all thinking about him.

784
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,059
Oh, my God.

785
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,770
It's that Brower kid.

786
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,189
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

787
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,943
I promise I won't hock no more dirty books.

788
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:58,239
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.
I promise I'll eat all my lima beans.

789
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,575
Two for flinching.

790
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,623
What is it, Chris?

791
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,375
Maybe it's coyotes.

792
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,711
Sounds like a woman screaming.

793
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,047
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

794
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,590
Don't say that.

795
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,300
Hey, Teddy, sit down.

796
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,011
I'm gonna go look for it.
I want to see the ghost.

797
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,262
Don't say that.

798
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,474
I just want to see it!
I just want to see what he looks like.

799
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,351
Jesus H. bald-headed Christ!

800
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,651
Maybe we should stand guard.

801
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,320
Yeah, that's a good idea.

802
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,033
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.

803
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,342
2300 hours.
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

804
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,015
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.

805
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,435
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.

806
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,865
-Teddy, cut it out, okay?
-I'm trying to sleep.

807
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,036
The dogfaces rested easy

808
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,789
in the knowledge that
Corporal Teddy Duchamp

809
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:34,294
-was protecting all that was dear to them.
-Teddy.

810
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,222
It should have been you, Gordon.

811
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,726
Are you okay?

812
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,231
You were dreaming.

813
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,411
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

814
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,084
I miss him, Chris.

815
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,169
I really miss him.

816
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,047
I know.

817
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,428
Go back to sleep.

818
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,972
Maybe you could go
into the college courses with me.

819
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,807
That'll be the day.

820
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,602
Why not? You're smart enough.

821
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,145
They won't let me.

822
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,648
What do you mean?

823
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,402
It's the way the people think
of my family in this town.

824
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:50,698
It's the way they think of me.
I'm just one of those low-life Chambers kids.

825
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,325
That's not true.

826
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,327
Oh, it is.

827
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,498
No one even asked me
if I took the milk money that time.

828
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,833
I just got a three-day vacation.

829
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,174
Did you take it?

830
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,260
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.

831
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,721
Teddy knew I took it.

832
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,892
Everyone knew I took it.
Even Vern knew it, I think.

833
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,441
Maybe I was sorry,
and I tried to give it back.

834
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,735
You tried to give it back?

835
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:31,030
Maybe, just maybe.

836
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:36,077
And maybe I took it to old lady Simons
and told her, and the money was all there.

837
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,831
But I still got a three-day vacation,
because it never showed up.

838
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,416
And maybe the next week, old lady Simons

839
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,670
had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school.

840
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,423
-Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.
-Yeah.

841
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:54,303
So let's just say that I stole the milk money,
but old lady Simons stole it back from me.

842
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,098
Just suppose that I told this story.

843
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,351
Me, Chris Chambers,
kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

844
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,854
Do you think that
anyone would have believed it?

845
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:03,938
No.

846
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,941
And do you think that that bitch would have
dared tried something like that

847
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,442
if it'd been one of those douche bags

848
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,611
from up on the View,
if they had taken the money?

849
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,530
-No way.
-Hell, no.

850
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,031
But, with me...

851
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,832
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time.

852
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,085
Anyway, she saw her chance
and she took it.

853
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,089
I was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back.

854
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,265
I just never thought,

855
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,936
I never thought that a teacher...

856
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,774
Oh, who gives a fuck anyway?

857
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,908
I just wish

858
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,579
that I could go someplace
where nobody knows me.

859
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:15,134
I guess I'm just a pussy, huh?

860
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,803
No way, man.

861
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,102
The freight woke up the other guys

862
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:10,606
and it was on the tip of my tongue
to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.

863
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,193
That was the one thing I kept to myself.

864
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,363
I've never spoken or written of it
until just now.

865
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,624
Jeez, Gordie, how come you didn't get
some breakfast stuff like

866
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,085
Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

867
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,797
Sorry, Vern. I guess a more experienced
shopper could've gotten more

868
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,757
for your seven cents.

869
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,721
With our stomachs rumbling,
we pressed on toward the Royal River.

870
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,892
The reality of Ray Brower was growing,
and kept us moving despite the heat.

871
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:51,272
For me, the idea
of seeing that kid's dead body

872
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,733
was starting to become an obsession.

873
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,538
Gentlemen, the Royal.

874
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,793
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

875
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:16,714
If we cut across this field right here,
we'll be there in an hour.

876
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,301
I think we should stick to the tracks.

877
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,345
I say we go across the field.

878
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,221
Gordie?

879
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,682
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

880
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,018
Take no prisoners!

881
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,440
Hey, you guys, it's a lot safer if we...

882
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,194
Come on, men. Let's take on the...

883
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,571
You don't know what's in those woods.

884
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,534
-Let's go. We're gonna get...
-Hey, you guys, wait up for me!

885
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,047
Ace, I gotta tell you something, but you
gotta swear on your mother's good name

886
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,673
that you won't tell anybody.

887
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:00,883
You got it, pal.

888
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,514
Hey, Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

889
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,265
What about him?

890
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,684
I could tell you something about him,
but you gotta swear

891
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,769
on your mother's good name

892
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,145
you ain't gonna tell nobody.

893
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:17,691
Billy and Charlie had managed to keep
their enormous secret for about 36 hours.

894
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,819
A personal record for both of them.

895
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:24,073
By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told
their secret to everybody in the gang.

896
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,327
I guess for those guys, protecting their
mother's good name wasn't a top priority.

897
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:32,081
Hey, listen, Ace.
Maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.

898
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,625
Yeah, maybe you could go without us?

899
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,462
You guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit.

900
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:39,922
I don't see your problem.

901
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,091
We go up with a whole bunch
of fishing gear,

902
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,592
and if a cop asks what we're doing there,

903
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:48,597
"We're here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river and look what we found."

904
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,016
Yeah, come on, man,
we're gonna be famous.

905
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:54,145
We're gonna be on every radio and TV show
in the country.

906
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,522
I still don't think we should go.

907
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,941
Okay. Okay.

908
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,819
You've stated your position clearly.

909
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,821
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

910
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,866
Get in the fucking car. Now!

911
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,576
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

912
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,217
-I hate this shortcut.
-"I hate this shortcut."

913
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,473
You flinched! Two for flinching.

914
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,936
But you flinched.

915
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,272
I know. Two for flinching.

916
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,753
How are we supposed to get across this?

917
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,464
-We use you as a raft.
-Very funny.

918
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,102
Hey, you know, it's not that deep.
We can walk across.

919
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,782
I told you we should have stuck
to the tracks.

920
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,912
Is it me,
or are you the world's biggest pussy?

921
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,790
I suppose this is fun for you.

922
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,167
No, but this is.

923
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,879
Want some more?

924
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:47,424
-Stop it, come on!
-Come on, Teddy, act your age.

925
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,592
This is my age.

926
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:51,512
I'm in the prime of my youth,
and I'll only be young once.

927
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,473
Yeah, but you're going to be stupid
for the rest of your life.

928
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:55,849
Rank-out!

929
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,185
Oh, that's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant.

930
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,812
You die, Chambers!

931
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,151
Get him! Get Vern!

932
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:10,155
-Vern Tessio dies!
-No, Teddy, you're gonna die!

933
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,412
Hey, where do you think
you're going, Lachance?

934
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,372
-Yeah, Lachance?
-Come on, you guys.

935
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,249
Pile on!

936
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,503
-Come on, you guys. I don't wanna do this.
-Pile on!

937
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,589
Get off!

938
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,593
-Sleeper hold. Sleeper hold.
-Stop it. I'm serious.

939
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,178
No one gets out of a sleeper hold.

940
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:35,681
Vern, there's something on your neck.

941
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,516
Yeah, right, I'm not falling for that one,
Lachance.

942
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,476
No, Vern, there is something on your neck.

943
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,687
It's a leech. Leeches!

944
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,355
-Oh, my God!
-Leeches!

945
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,155
Jesus Christ!

946
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:52,531
Oh, my God!

947
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,871
Get them off!

948
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,331
They're on me!

949
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:04,335
-Gordie, man, there's some on your back.
-Get them off!

950
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:07,004
-Oh, my God! They're all over my legs!
-They're on your back!

951
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,714
Are there any on mine, man?

952
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:29,902
Oh, Chris.

953
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,904
Oh, shit, Chris.

954
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:35,783
Oh, shit, man.

955
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,765
Gordie, man, are you okay?

956
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,185
Can you hear me?

957
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,437
Gordie, are you there?

958
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,106
Maybe he's dead.

959
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,441
He's not dead. He's still breathing, you idiot.

960
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,609
Well, I don't know.

961
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,529
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

962
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:14,905
Gordie?

963
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,953
God, I never met anybody
who fainted before.

964
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,165
Maybe he made a bad mistake
and looked at your face.

965
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,709
Shut up, Teddy.

966
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,335
You okay, Gordie?

967
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,255
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

968
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,221
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

969
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,099
Great, Chambers,
now you're turning pussy, too!

970
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,559
What's your problem, Duchamp?

971
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,686
He had a leech hanging from his balls.
He fainted.

972
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,979
What are you? His mother?

973
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,939
-Eat shit.
-You eat shit.

974
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,818
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

975
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:56,697
What a surprise! The king of the pussies
wants to go back, too.

976
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,991
-Stop calling me that.
-What, "Pussy"? Pussy!

977
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,659
-Stop it!
-Pussy!

978
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,369
You four-eyed psycho!

979
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,954
Get off me!

980
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,333
Two for flinching. Do you like it?
Do you like it? Two for flinching.

981
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,668
-Stop it.
-You like it, huh, Teddy?

982
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,921
-Come on, you guys. Break it up.
-Stop it. Stop it!

983
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,557
I'm not going back.

984
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,856
-Idiot.
-Shut up! Retard.

985
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:40,032
At the time, I didn't know why I needed
to see that body so badly.

986
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,744
Even if no one had followed me,
I would have gone on alone.

987
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,802
No way, Ace! Not this time, man. No way!

988
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,429
-Go for it, Vince. Go for it.
-You want to race? Oh, yeah?

989
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,567
Oh, my God, I got him.

990
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,489
You are history, guy. History!

991
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,825
-Fall back, Ace.
-Come on, don't fuck around.

992
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,790
-Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!
-What are you doing?

993
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,516
Shit, man! Shit!

994
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,142
I won.

995
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,397
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.

996
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,451
Coming through the woods,
I bet we saved over an hour.

997
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,123
-Teddy?
-Yeah?

998
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,209
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

999
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,628
Yeah.

1000
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,339
The Brower kid must be
around here someplace.

1001
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,800
Teddy, you and Vern
watch the left side of the tracks.

1002
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,052
-We'll take the right.
-All right.

1003
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,735
There he is! I see him! Look!

1004
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,987
Look over there! I see him!

1005
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,909
None of us could breathe.

1006
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,787
Somewhere under those bushes
was the rest of Ray Brower.

1007
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,886
The train had knocked Ray Brower
out of his Keds,

1008
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,889
just like it had knocked the life
out of his body.

1009
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,015
Jesus.

1010
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,810
The kid wasn't sick.

1011
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,104
The kid wasn't sleeping.

1012
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:18,482
The kid was dead.

1013
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,709
Let's look for some long branches.
We'll build him a stretcher.

1014
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,057
Gordie?

1015
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,317
Why did you have to die?

1016
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,070
What's the matter with Gordie?

1017
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,238
Nothing.

1018
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,241
Why don't you guys just go over there
and look for some branches, okay?

1019
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,409
Okay.

1020
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,256
Why did he have to die, Chris?

1021
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,260
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

1022
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:31,930
I don't know.

1023
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,934
-It should have been me.
-Don't say that.

1024
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,729
-It should have been me.
-Don't say that, man.

1025
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:44,026
I'm no good. My dad said it. I'm no good.

1026
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,652
He doesn't know you.

1027
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,155
He hates me.

1028
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,781
He doesn't hate you.

1029
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,576
-He hates me.
-No.

1030
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,453
He just doesn't know you.

1031
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:57,664
He hates me. My dad hates me.

1032
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,835
He hates me. Oh, God.

1033
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,986
You're gonna be a great writer someday,
Gordie.

1034
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:33,909
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard up for material.

1035
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:55,680
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard up, huh?

1036
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:58,975
Yeah.

1037
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,481
What the fuck do you know about this?

1038
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:08,026
Son of a bitch! My little brother.

1039
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,407
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

1040
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,619
You get away, man.

1041
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,579
We found him. We got dibs.

1042
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,959
We better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

1043
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:27,921
We earned him, man. You guys
came in a car. That's not fair. He's ours.

1044
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,923
"That's not fair. He's ours."

1045
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,008
Well, not anymore.

1046
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,428
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

1047
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,556
Oh, we will. Don't you worry.

1048
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,063
Vern, you little son of a whore.

1049
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:48,733
-You was under the porch.
-No, I swear it wasn't me.

1050
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:52,320
You keyhole-peeping bung.
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

1051
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,829
You guys have two choices.

1052
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,749
You either leave quietly
and we take the body

1053
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,086
or you stay and we beat the shit out of you.

1054
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,088
And we take the body.

1055
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,842
-Besides, me and Billy found him first.
-Yeah, Vern told us how you found him.

1056
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:17,679
"Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car."

1057
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,683
"Billy, I think I just turned
my Fruit of the Looms into a fudge factory."

1058
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,269
-That's it. Your ass is grass!
-Hold it.

1059
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,484
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.
This is your last chance.

1060
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,571
What do you say, kid?

1061
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:39,075
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

1062
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,956
You're dead.

1063
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,292
Come on, Chris, let's split.

1064
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,378
-They're not taking him.
-Come on, man, this is crazy.

1065
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,923
-They're not taking him.
-He's got a knife, man.

1066
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,133
Ace, come on, man.

1067
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,515
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1068
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:03,850
No problem.

1069
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,867
You're not taking him. Nobody's taking him.

1070
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,665
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

1071
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,669
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

1072
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,255
Don't move, Ace.

1073
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,342
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1074
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,888
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1075
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,560
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

1076
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:56,236
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

1077
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:05,537
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1078
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,331
No, Ace, just you.

1079
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,802
We're gonna get you for this.

1080
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,430
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1081
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:25,307
Oh, we will.

1082
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:41,573
We're not gonna forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

1083
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,034
This is big time, baby.

1084
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,802
"Suck my fat one"?

1085
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,931
Whoever told you,
you had a fat one, Lachance?

1086
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:12,312
-Biggest one in four counties.
-Yeah.

1087
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,372
Are we gonna take him?

1088
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,873
No.

1089
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,627
But we came all this way?

1090
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,588
We were supposed to be heroes.

1091
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,716
Not this way, Teddy.

1092
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,180
Chris, give me a hand.

1093
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,227
Ray Brower's body was found,

1094
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,397
but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit.

1095
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:00,068
In the end, we decided that an anonymous
phone call was the best thing to do.

1096
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:10,370
We headed home. And although
many thoughts raced through our minds,

1097
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,122
we barely spoke.

1098
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,087
We walked through the night
and made it back to Castle Rock

1099
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:23,883
a little past 5:00 on Sunday morning,
the day before Labor Day.

1100
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:29,139
We'd only been gone two days,
but somehow the town seemed different,

1101
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,099
smaller.

1102
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,202
Well, see you in school.

1103
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,206
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1104
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,041
See you in junior high.

1105
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:12,182
A penny.

1106
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:25,028
Well, guys, I better get home before my
mom puts me on the "1 0 Most Wanted List."

1107
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:34,871
Hey, Chris?

1108
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,916
No hard feelings, okay?

1109
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,001
No way, man.

1110
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,862
As time went on we saw less and less
of Teddy and Vern

1111
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,200
until eventually they became
just two more faces in the halls.

1112
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,952
It happens sometimes.

1113
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,789
Friends come in and out of your life
like busboys in a restaurant.

1114
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,834
I heard that Vern got married
out of high school, had four kids

1115
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:25,588
and is now the forklift operator
at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.

1116
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:30,176
Teddy tried several times to get into the
army, but his eyes and his ear kept him out.

1117
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,720
Last I'd heard he'd spent some time in jail

1118
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,682
and was now doing odd jobs
around Castle Rock.

1119
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,151
I'm never gonna get out of this town,
am I, Gordie?

1120
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,030
You can do anything you want, man.

1121
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,285
Yeah, sure.

1122
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,253
Give me some skin.

1123
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:15,763
I'll see ya.

1124
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,974
Not if I see you first.

1125
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,355
Chris did get out.

1126
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,691
He enrolled in the college courses with me.

1127
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,320
And although it was hard,
he gutted it out like he always did.

1128
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:33,531
He went on to college and eventually
became a lawyer.

1129
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,951
Last week, he entered a fast-food restaurant.

1130
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,204
Just ahead of him,
two men got into an argument.

1131
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,123
One of them pulled a knife.

1132
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,793
Chris, who'd always made the best peace,
tried to break it up.

1133
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,129
He was stabbed in the throat.

1134
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,381
He died almost instantly.

1135
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,278
Dad, can we go now?

1136
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,532
-You ready?
-Yeah, we've been ready for an hour.

1137
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,412
Okay, I'll be right there.

1138
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:23,665
He said that a half hour ago.

1139
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,793
Yeah, my dad's weird.
He gets like that when he's writing.
