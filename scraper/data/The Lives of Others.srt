1
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,917
Stand still. Eyes to the floor.

2
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:47,583
Walk on.

3
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,750
TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER

4
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,375
MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY

5
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,125
Address him as Captain.

6
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,625
Enter.

7
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,875
Sit down.

8
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,375
Hands on your thighs, palms down.

9
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,958
What do you have to tell us?

10
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,250
I've done nothing.

11
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,583
I know nothing.

12
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,792
You've done nothing, know nothing...

13
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,333
You think we imprison people on a whim?

14
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:30,917
No...

15
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:34,000
If you think our humanistic system capable of such a thing,

16
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,667
that alone would justify your arrest.

17
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:43,083
We'd like to jog your memory,
prisoner number 227.

18
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:48,708
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens,
your friend and neighbor,

19
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,708
fled to the West.
We believe that he had help.

20
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:57,125
I know nothing.
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.

21
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,417
I first heard about it at work.

22
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,375
Please recount
what you did on September 28th.

23
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,083
-It's in my statement.
-Tell me again.

24
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:13,000
I was at Treptow Park Memorial
with my children.

25
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,000
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.

26
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:20,083
We went to his place
and listened to music until late.

27
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,083
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

28
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,292
I can give you the number.

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,000
The enemies of our state are arrogant.
Remember that.

30
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,167
It takes patience. About 40 hours' worth.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,042
line 31

32
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,375
Fast forward...

33
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,167
I want to sleep.

34
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,125
Please, let me sleep!

35
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,583
Hands on your thighs.

36
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:54,667
Tell me again
what you did on September 28th.

37
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,000
Please, just one hour...

38
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,500
Just a little... A little sleep.

39
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,583
Tell me again what you did on that day.

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,208
Why keep him awake for so long?

41
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,917
It's inhuman.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,833
An innocent prisoner
will become more angry by the hour

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,792
due to the injustice suffered.
He will shout and rage.

44
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:36,250
A guilty prisoner
becomes more calm and quiet...

45
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,750
Or he cries.

46
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,458
He knows he's there for a reason.

47
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,833
The best way to establish guilt or innocence
48
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,125
is non-stop interrogation.

49
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,208
...school friend Max Kirchner.

50
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,667
We went to his place

51
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,792
and listened to music until late.

52
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:05,958
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

53
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,083
Do you notice anything
about his statement?

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,417
It's the same as at the beginning.

55
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,667
Exactly the same. Word for word

56
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,417
People who tell the truth
can re-formulate things, and they do.

57
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,583
A liar has prepared sentences

58
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,083
which he falls back on
when under pressure.

59
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,792
227 is lying.
We have two important indicators

60
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,625
and can increase the intensity.

61
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,875
If you don't give names,
we'll have to arrest your wife.

62
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,250
Jan and Nadja will be put into state care.

63
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,500
Is that what you want?

64
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,708
Who was the person who helped him flee?

65
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,542
-Glaske...
-Again! Speak clearly!

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,417
-Glaske... Werner Glaske.
-Werner...

67
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,458
...Glaske

68
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,083
Quiet!

69
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,750
Quiet!

70
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,458
Listen!

71
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,667
Does anyone know what that is?

72
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,375
It's the odor sample for the dogs.

73
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,792
It must be collected at every interrogation.
Never forget it!

74
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,125
Your subjects are enemies of socialism.

75
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,833
Never forget that!

76
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,417
Good-bye.

77
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,167
That was good, really good.

78
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,583
You remember

79
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,583
how we sat there 20 years ago?

80
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,583
They've offered me a professorship.

81
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,500
Life's not about good grades, though
mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.

82
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,750
So what's up?

83
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,958
Why do you always think I'm scheming?

84
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,458
-I wanted to invite you to the theater.
-The theater?

85
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,917
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.

86
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,042
As head of the Culture Department,
I should show my face.

87
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:43,042
It starts at 7:00 p.m. We should get going.

88
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,542
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

89
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,917
Minister Hempf at 1:00.

90
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,250
He used to be in State Security, you know.

91
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,250
He really cleaned up the theater scene.

92
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,541
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

93
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,375
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

94
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,750
An arrogant type,
the kind I warn my students about.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,375
But he's loyal. If they were all like him,

96
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:30,250
I'd be out of a job.
He's our only non-subversive writer

97
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,500
who is also read in the West.

98
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,542
He thinks the GDR is
the greatest country on earth.

99
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,958
See for yourself.

100
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,833
-What's wrong, my child? A new vision?
-Speak, Marta!

101
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,917
-Speak!
-Your Arthur...

102
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,417
-Is dead.
-Arthur?

103
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,583
Can't you be wrong, just this once?

104
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,542
No, sister. Believe me.

105
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,958
He fell to his death.

106
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,417
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

107
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:23,750
I see it,

108
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,458
though I'd rather see any other horror.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,083
Why am I not spared these visions?

110
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,917
Elena!

111
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,542
Go home

112
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,417
and mourn. I'll finish your shift.

113
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,625
Did you like it?

114
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:29,000
-Dreyman's good, huh?
-I'd have him monitored.

115
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,292
Monitored?
All that teaching is ruining your instincts.

116
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,583
-I could oversee it myself.
-He's clean, I tell you.

117
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,500
Even Hempf likes him.
We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.

118
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
I'm going down.

119
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,417
FACES OF LOVE

120
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,292
I hear a lot about your work.

121
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,583
They say culture's in good hands.
Your name is mentioned

122
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:24,042
-in Party circles.
-We're the Party's "shield and sword."

123
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,333
I'm aware of that at all times.

124
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,083
What do you make of him?

125
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,583
Of Georg Dreyman?

126
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:42,958
Maybe...

127
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,000
Maybe what?

128
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,500
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.

129
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,458
Grubitz!

130
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,167
That's why you and I are on top.

131
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,083
Your average Stasi chump would have said,

132
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:07,125
"One of our best! So loyal!" etc.
But we can see more.

133
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,833
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.

134
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,333
There's something fishy about him.
I can feel it in my gut.

135
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,125
Dreyman's having a party next week.

136
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,833
Some dubious types are going...

137
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:31,917
Hauser and that rabble.
Try to wire the place discreetly by then.

138
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,958
Measures A and B. Only in his rooms.

139
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,958
Nothing conspicuous.
He has powerful friends.

140
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,542
No one is to know about this

141
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,750
until we've found something.

142
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
But if you get something on him,

143
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,125
you'll have a good friend
in the Central Committee.

144
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,792
You understand what I'm saying?

145
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,917
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.

146
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,458
Why is he staring at us?

147
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,875
What's he doing here, anyway?

148
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,375
I think he's got a crush on you.

149
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,417
I can't let the evening pass

150
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,750
without raising a toast to our artists.
A great Socialist,

151
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,042
I can't recall who it was, once said,

152
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,333
"Writers are engineers of the soul."

153
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,583
So Georg Dreyman is
one of our country's greatest engineers.

154
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,625
-What charming bedfellows you have.
-Paul!

155
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,583
And to Christa-Maria Sieland,

156
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,083
the loveliest pearl of the GDR.

157
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,250
Let's raise our glasses
to Christa-Maria Sieland.

158
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,583
Three cheers to her.

159
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,542
Someone like him doesn't
even deserve to address you.

160
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,792
Stay with me!

161
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,167
And now something for the soul.

162
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,625
May I?

163
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,250
-How did you like my speech?
-Many thanks.

164
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,292
I liked your play, too.

165
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,083
-Really, it was good.
-"Engineers of the soul."

166
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,167
-That was a Stalin quote.
-Really?

167
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,833
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.

168
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,000
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.

169
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,417
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.

170
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,417
He knows that the Party needs artists,
but that artists need the Party even more.

171
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,042
If you're going to talk politics,
I'll find another dance partner.

172
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,083
-I'm willing.
-Too late!

173
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:37,917
-I follow our theater with interest.
-It used to be theater people...

174
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,000
Paul!

175
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,917
It's okay, I've known Mr. Hauser for years.
Comrade Schwalber!

176
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,083
You did a good job tonight, too.

177
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:52,125
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working
with such directors. It wasn't always so.

178
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,833
You're referring to Jerska?

179
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,500
I think you judged him too harshly.

180
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,583
Sure, he went too far in what he said.

181
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,250
Without a doubt.

182
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,750
But put yourself in his shoes for a moment.

183
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,208
You, as a man of honor.

184
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,625
He can't remove his name
from that statement.

185
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:24,875
He could work for any theater in the West.
But he wants to stay here.

186
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,833
Because he believes in socialism
and in this country.

187
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,833
-His blacklisting is...
-Blacklisting?

188
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,833
We don't do that here!

189
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,500
You should choose your words
more carefully.

190
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,125
Comrade Hempf, just between us,

191
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,792
my plays are not strong enough
to survive Schwalber's direction.

192
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,333
I need Jerska,
and I think you judged him too harshly.

193
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:01,667
Well, I don't.
But that's what we all love about your plays.

194
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,042
Your love for mankind,

195
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,542
your belief that people can change.

196
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,958
Dreyman, no matter how often
you say it in your plays,

197
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:14,792
people do not change!

198
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,250
How is he, by the way?

199
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,458
He hopes that his black...

200
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,417
That he can work again soon.

201
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,250
-Is he right in hoping?
-Of course he is.

202
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,000
As long as he lives, and even longer.

203
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,875
Because as you know, Dreyman,
hope always dies last.

204
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,833
The team will be ready
to wire the place as of tomorrow.

205
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,958
It needs to be finished by Thursday.

206
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,167
Think you can do it?

207
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,000
Good night.

208
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,292
...and land for chicken farmers,

209
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,042
but used in an efficient way...

210
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,875
The 10th Party Conference
economic policy is solid.

211
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,208
Now more than ever, the...

212
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,583
-I'll get in trouble if I don't go.
-With who?

213
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,875
My girlfriend.

214
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,583
Girlfriend?

215
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,458
-All right, then.
-Come on, let's play!

216
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,292
Twenty minutes.

217
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,792
-Yes?
-Frau Meineke,

218
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,792
one word of this to anyone,
and Masha loses her spot at the university.

219
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,875
-Is that understood?
-Yes.

220
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:08,000
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift
for her cooperation.

221
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,583
It must be Thursday again.

222
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,375
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.

223
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,875
-How are you?
-Not bad.

224
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not always this noisy.

225
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,542
Only on Thursdays, I know.

226
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,583
Yes.

227
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,875
We missed you at the premiere.

228
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,208
Did Schwalber do a good job?

229
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:12,083
-His good bits were stolen from you.
-That keeps my ideas alive.

230
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:26,417
I can't bear those fat,
dressed-up people at premieres anymore.

231
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:32,208
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

232
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,083
But maybe this is the real me,
not the old Jerska.

233
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,333
He was friendly and caring,
nourished by success,

234
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,417
all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.

235
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,542
But I won't complain much longer.

236
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:59,708
In my next life, I'll simply be an author.

237
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,833
A happy author
who can write whenever he wants.

238
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,250
Like you.

239
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,417
What is a director if he can't direct?

240
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,750
He's a projectionist without a film,

241
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,042
a miller without corn. He is nothing.

242
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,917
Nothing at all.

243
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:31,375
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere.
Minister Hempf.

244
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,917
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.

245
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,250
It looks promising.

246
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,125
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.

247
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:51,833
Really?

248
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,333
That's great.

249
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,375
Cheap Georgian wine. Chateau Jerska.

250
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,958
So is our holy drinker coming?

251
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,417
I forget to ask him.

252
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,167
You're strong and forceful.

253
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,292
That's how I need you.
Don't let this blackness into your life.

254
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,917
Albert is my friend.

255
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,333
-And you're my boyfriend.
-Looks like a 50th.

256
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,750
But I'm going to be 40, right?

257
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:17,500
Don't forget,
you promised to wear a tie for your birthday.

258
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,958
I would, but I don't have one.

259
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:25,917
Bon anniversaire!

260
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,917
A tie?

261
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,083
You said you didn't want any books.

262
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,750
Or can't you tie a tie,
you old working-class poet?

263
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,333
What? I was born wearing a tie!

264
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,542
I had to "fight my way out
of my middle-class fetters

265
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,583
Then put those fetters on again, just for me.

266
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,417
All right...

267
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:06,167
It's no big deal to tie a tie.

268
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:25,917
Frau Meineke,
would you come in for a moment!

269
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,375
Can you tie a tie?

270
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,917
You've no idea how thankful I am.

271
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,208
Are you feeling unwell?

272
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,083
No... I'm feeling fine.

273
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,333
Finished?

274
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,208
Wonderful. It's perfect. It couldn't be better.

275
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:09,667
It'll be our secret.
You can keep a secret, right?

276
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,667
Of course.

277
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,583
I'll be damned!

278
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,375
And I thought you couldn't do it.

279
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,917
You don't normally hide your talents.

280
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,542
You've no idea of the things I can do!

281
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,167
The first guest.

282
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,917
Our dear neighbors locked
the main door again. Can you go?

283
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,458
Yes, I'm going.

284
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:18,292
Maestro! Our humble offerings.

285
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,875
I expressly said no books! But thanks.

286
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,333
Have a look first.

287
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,583
-Would you like a drink?
-A soda.

288
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,708
-Vodka for me.
-I'll get it.

289
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:44,750
-Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?
-He won't talk to us.

290
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,292
He sent us all away.

291
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,792
I brought you something, too.

292
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,750
Did you really come here to read?

293
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,167
It is Brecht!

294
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,792
I feel like a fraud among these people.

295
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,583
A fraud? Come off it, Albert!

296
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,750
You're losing your grip on reality.

297
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,958
You know how we admire you,
how everybody admires you.

298
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,875
For something I did 10 years ago

299
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,292
and could probably never do again.

300
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,833
My favorite director! Wait!

301
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,208
I need to talk to you a moment.

302
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,750
Tell me again
how you got into this position.

303
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,917
Pure talent.

304
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,208
Of course!

305
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,583
But what else did you have to do?

306
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,042
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!

307
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,500
What an outrageous insinuation!

308
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,083
-Paul!
-What?

309
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,958
Excuse my friend,
he's had too much to drink.

310
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:22,000
-But you know he's with the Stasi!
-No, Paul.

311
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't know that.

312
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:46,292
You're such an idealist
that you're almost a bigwig.

313
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:51,417
It was informers and conformists
like that who ruined Albert.

314
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:55,000
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!

315
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,750
If you ever want to take action, call.

316
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,417
If not, we don't have to meet again.

317
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:35,417
-Your friends don't have much taste.
-That's really unfair.

318
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,083
Here!

319
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,875
-Look at this beautiful backscratcher.
-That's a salad fork.

320
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,708
Still, it's beautiful...

321
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,458
And look at this.

322
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:54,208
-I'll write my new play with this.
-You have no taste either!

323
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,792
I do in some things.

324
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,500
It's from Jerska.

325
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,250
So he did give you a book!

326
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,333
SONATA FORA GOOD MAN

327
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:52,125
11:04 p.m.
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents.

328
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:57,500
Then presumably have intercourse.

329
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,458
You're late.

330
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:07,458
Sorry, Captain. Those red lights made me
lose all of four minutes.

331
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,583
You know how it is.

332
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,292
They're already at it! Unbelievable!

333
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,625
These artists! They're always at it!

334
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:30,083
That's why I prefer monitoring artists
to priests or peace activists.

335
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,583
See you tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

336
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,667
Albert Jerska, Operation "Engerling."

337
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,458
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.
The files will be sent. Let's have lunch.

338
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,583
The BSG volleyball team will
meet at 7:00 p.m.

339
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,208
Did you forget? Bosses sit over there.

340
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,875
Socialism must start somewhere.

341
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:23,917
About the license plate of the car
that brought Ms. Sieland home...

342
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,750
It's Minister Hempf's car.

343
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:35,250
Wiesler, we can't monitor top officials.

344
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:42,333
I removed the entry in your report.
Nothing written from now on, just oral!

345
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,875
So we're helping a Committee member
get a rival out of the way.

346
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,250
You know what this could mean
for my career. And for yours.

347
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,750
If we find something...

348
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,250
Is that why we joined?

349
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,417
You remember the oath we took?

350
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:16,083
-"We are the Party's shield and sword."
-What is the Party, if not its members?

351
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,583
And if those members are highly influential,
all the better!

352
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,750
I've got a new one.

353
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,625
Honecker comes into his office,

354
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,333
opens the window, sees the sun, and says...

355
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,833
What's wrong?

356
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,708
Oh, excuse me...

357
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,667
I just...

358
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,917
No, carry on, colleague!

359
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,250
No harm in laughing
about the Party Chairman, is there?

360
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,125
I probably know the joke anyway.

361
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,583
Come on, tell us!

362
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,250
Well...

363
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:01,375
Honecker...
I mean, the Comrade General Secretary

364
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,667
sees the sun and says,
"Good morning, dear sun!"

365
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,375
More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"

366
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:17,417
The sun replies, "Good morning,
dear Erich!" And at noon,

367
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,167
Erich goes to the window and says,
"Good day, dear sun!"

368
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:27,125
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!"
In the evening, Erich says again,

369
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:30,083
"Good evening, dear sun!"
and the sun doesn't reply.

370
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,083
"Good evening, dear sun..."

371
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,167
"What's wrong?" he asks.

372
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,667
And the sun replies,
"Screw you, I'm in the West now!"

373
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,208
Name?

374
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,542
Rank? Department?

375
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,542
Me?

376
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,375
Stigler.

377
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,583
Second Lieutenant Axel Stigler.
Department M.

378
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:03,583
I don't have to tell you
what this means for your career.

379
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,458
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I was just...

380
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:14,167
You were just deriding the Party!

381
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:17,750
That's incitement,
and likely just the tip of the iceberg!

382
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,458
I will report this to the Minister's office.

383
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,583
Just kidding! Good one, huh?

384
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,917
But yours was good, too.
I know a better one, though.

385
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:44,000
What's the difference
between Honecker and a phone?

386
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,167
None at all. Hang up, try again!

387
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,583
-Are you coming, too?
-No, I have to get home.

388
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,708
Bye.

389
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,042
Cold?

390
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,292
Christa,
you forget our meeting on Thursday.

391
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,917
Or did your poet
have two birthdays in a row?

392
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,958
Come on, get in.

393
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,083
Get in!

394
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,667
You don't know what's good for you.

395
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:31,667
Don't worry.

396
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,250
I'm looking after you.

397
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,708
Tell me you don't need it, too.

398
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,417
Just say so, and I'll let you go.

399
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,958
I'm meeting someone.

400
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,000
Where do you think we're going?

401
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,375
I'm taking you to him!

402
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,375
You'll be there even quicker.

403
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,875
Time for some bitter truths.

404
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,083
Yes?

405
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,208
Those idiots!

406
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,958
Next Thursday at the Metropol.

407
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:15,500
Drive!

408
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,458
Christa?

409
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:40,417
Just hold me.

410
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,292
Good evening, Comrade!

411
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,667
You're five minutes late again.

412
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,167
Evening. 11th floor, right corridor.

413
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,417
I'm already up here.

414
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:13,667
How did you get into the building?

415
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,250
A bunch of you guys live here.

416
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,958
I don't think I've been here before.

417
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,583
No, I don't think you have.

418
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,875
Well? Was that nice?

419
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,458
Stay a while.

420
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:53,208
I can't, my next customer is at half past.

421
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,208
I work on a schedule.

422
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,083
At 1:30?

423
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:10,458
-You won't make it.
-Sure I will. Don't you worry.

424
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,917
Book me for longer next time.

425
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,375
Bye.

426
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:24,417
Georg?

427
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:28,958
-Did you hear about Hauser?
-No, what happened?

428
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,917
He can't get a travel permit
for his lectures in the West.

429
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,083
Are you surprised?
If he acts so arrogantly, he should expect it.

430
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,125
Would you let him go,
if you were in their position?

431
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:53,708
CMS comes home.

432
00:50:53,750 --> 00:51:00,000
"Lazlo" approves
of Hauser's foreign travel ban.

433
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,583
-Have you seen my Brecht book?
-What?

434
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,500
My Brecht book.

435
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,583
I don't know where it is.

436
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,417
Strange. I could've sworn...

437
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,917
One day in blue-moon September,

438
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,625
silent under a plum tree,

439
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,000
I held her, my silent pale love,

440
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,042
in my arms like a fair and lovely dream.

441
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,292
Above us in the summer skies

442
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,875
was a cloud that caught my eye.

443
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,500
It was white and so high up.

444
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:44,500
And when I looked up,
it was no longer there.

445
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,500
-Yes?
-Georg? Wallner here.

446
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,667
What's up?

447
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,042
Georg, it's about Jerska.

448
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,792
He hanged himself last night.

449
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,583
Georg?

450
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:30,083
I'm going to hang up, okay?

451
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:22,083
You know what Lenin said
about Beethoven's Appassionata.

452
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,583
"If I keep listening to it,
I won't finish the revolution."

453
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,750
Can anyone who has heard this music,

454
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,625
I mean truly heard it,

455
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,625
really be a bad person?

456
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,833
Are you really with the Stasi?

457
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,500
Do you even know what the Stasi is?

458
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,667
Yes. They're bad men who
put people in prison, says my dad.

459
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,583
I see.

460
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,083
What's the name of your...

461
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,917
My what?

462
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,417
Ball! What's the name of your ball?

463
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,250
You're funny! Balls don't have names.

464
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,333
It's all in place, Minister.

465
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,708
The latest technology.

466
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:04,167
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.

467
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,500
-Measure C in the hall...
-You said you'd find something!

468
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,250
Find something!

469
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:13,167
I'd advise even my worst enemy
not to disappoint me.

470
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,792
Now get out of here.

471
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,833
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.

472
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:33,000
You'll report on every minute
that she's not with me.

473
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:39,375
We revoked Hauser's travel permit
for the culture conference.

474
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,542
Maybe that'll lead to something.

475
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,917
The two of them are very close.

476
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,958
How's it going
between CMS and the Minister?

477
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,583
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.

478
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:53,167
That's good. Very good.

479
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,708
We have a lot to gain from this love story.

480
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:58,917
Or a lot to lose.

481
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,083
Don't forget that.

482
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,500
I used to be afraid of just two things:

483
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,125
Being alone, and not being able to write.

484
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:24,667
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing

485
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,250
or about other people.

486
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:31,083
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.

487
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,750
You needn't be afraid tonight.

488
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,917
-I'm just going out for a few hours.
-Where to?

489
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:43,625
An old classmate's in town.

490
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,083
Really, Christa?

491
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:49,917
Really?

492
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,292
How dare you.

493
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:56,958
I know.

494
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,250
I know where you're going.

495
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,375
And I'm asking you not to go.

496
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,583
You don't need him.

497
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,042
You don't need him.

498
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,333
I know about your medication, too.

499
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:27,625
And how little faith you have in your talent.

500
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,292
Have faith in me, at least.

501
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:35,125
Christa-Maria.

502
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:38,458
You are a great artist.

503
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,542
I know that.

504
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,375
And your audience knows it, too.

505
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:48,333
You don't need him.

506
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,417
You don't need him.

507
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:54,417
Stay here.

508
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:57,375
Don't go to him.

509
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,292
No?

510
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:04,917
Don't I need him?

511
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,417
Don't I need this whole system?

512
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,583
What about you?

513
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,083
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.

514
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:23,083
But you get in bed with them, too.
Why do you do it?

515
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:29,083
Because they can destroy you, too,
despite your talent and your faith.

516
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,167
Because they decide what we play,

517
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,000
who is to act, and who can direct.

518
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,917
You don't want to end up like Jerska.

519
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,083
And neither do I.

520
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,083
That's why I'm going now.

521
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,875
You're right about so many things,

522
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:55,417
and I want to change so much.

523
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,250
But I ask you,

524
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,375
I implore you,

525
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,167
don't go.

526
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,667
Well, boss, am I on time?

527
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,458
Let me guess what those two are doing...

528
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:14,417
Bang, bang, bang! Come on, I'll take over.

529
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,583
I don't want you
to do overtime because of me.

530
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,792
"Don't go through that door."

531
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,792
Where's she going?

532
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:36,708
To meet an old classmate.

533
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:45,125
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow.
I can manage.

534
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,583
Good night.

535
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,000
What are you staring at?

536
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:57,500
Soda water.

537
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,333
No...

538
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,417
Vodka.

539
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,375
Double.

540
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:13,542
Another one.

541
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,125
Can I have a cognac, please?

542
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:24,917
Madam?

543
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,750
Go away, I want to be alone.

544
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,250
Ms. Sieland.

545
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,583
Do we know each other?

546
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,875
You don't know me, but I know you.

547
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:41,250
Many people love you

548
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,250
for who you are.

549
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:51,208
-Actors are never "who they are."
-You are.

550
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:00,375
I've seen you on stage.

551
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:05,875
You were more who you are

552
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:11,500
than you are now.

553
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,792
So you know what I'm like.

554
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,583
I'm your audience.

555
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,083
I have to go.

556
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:29,542
Where to?

557
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,792
I'm meeting an old classmate. I...

558
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:35,833
You see?

559
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,375
Just now you weren't being yourself.

560
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,583
No?

561
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,125
No.

562
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,708
So you know her well,

563
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,917
this Christa-Maria Sieland.

564
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,250
What do you think...

565
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,125
Would she hurt someone
who loves her above all else?

566
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:17,500
-Would she sell herself for art?
-For art?

567
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:20,708
You already have art. That'd be a bad deal.

568
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,750
You are a great artist.

569
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,292
Don't you know that?

570
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,083
And you are a good man.

571
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:14,750
When I begin my shift
"Lazlo" and CMS are arguing

572
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:19,250
about whether CMS should
meet her classmate.

573
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,583
Eventually, she leaves.

574
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,708
"Lazlo" seems unhappy about this.

575
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:30,000
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns

576
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,125
to "Lazlo's" surprise, and mine.

577
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,625
He seems very happy about this.

578
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,917
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.

579
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:44,042
She says she'll never leave again.

580
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,000
He says repeatedly,

581
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,792
"Now I'll have the strength,
now I'll do something."

582
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:53,917
This likely refers
to writing a new stage play.

583
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,792
In recent weeks, "Lazlo's" play writing

584
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,625
had been plagued by difficulties.

585
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,583
What she means by her statement is unclear.

586
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:06,917
Perhaps she intends to
take better care of his household.

587
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,917
The rest of the night was peaceful.

588
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:12,458
Oh, Comrade...

589
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,667
It's just because...

590
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:16,750
He's sleeping, too...

591
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:19,667
Good report.

592
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:23,917
Really?

593
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,042
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.

594
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,375
Neither did I.

595
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,000
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side."

596
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:03,833
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street

597
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,917
counts everything, knows everything.

598
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,208
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

599
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:12,208
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

600
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,833
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year:

601
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,208
6347.

602
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,042
But there is one thing they don't count,

603
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:25,875
maybe because even bureaucrats
find it painful,

604
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:28,000
and that's suicides.

605
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,208
If you call Beimler Street to ask

606
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,208
how many people
between the Elbe and the Oder,

607
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,375
between the Baltic Sea
and the Ore Mountains,

608
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:37,708
despair drove to their death,

609
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:42,208
our numbers oracle is silent.
But it may just note your name

610
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,083
for State Security,

611
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:48,083
those gray men
who ensure safety in our land

612
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,292
and happiness.

613
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:55,167
In 1977,
your country stopped counting suicides.

614
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:58,667
They called them "self murderers."

615
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:02,792
But it has nothing to do with murder.

616
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:07,000
It knows no blood lust, no heated passion.

617
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:11,750
It knows only death, the death of all hope.

618
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,583
When we stopped counting,

619
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:19,292
only one country in Europe
drove more people to their death:

620
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,417
Hungary.

621
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,375
We came next,
the land of"Real Existing Socialism."

622
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:30,500
One of the uncounted is Albert Jerska,
the great director.

623
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,792
It's him I want to talk about today...

624
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,333
I tried to get statistics that show that...

625
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:44,583
That State Security operates more
effectively we think.

626
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:56,583
I foolishly rehearsed
my speech for the West in here.

627
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,583
Since then, I've become very musical.

628
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,792
We can meet at my place.

629
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,500
3:00 P.M. PANKOW MEMORIAL

630
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,542
Well? Is this safe enough?

631
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:33,417
My own "bodyguard." I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.

632
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,583
Fire away.

633
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:40,208
Here.

634
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,875
You want to publish this?

635
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,083
In the West, with your help. Will you help?

636
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,708
Have you told Christa?

637
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:05,750
No.

638
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:11,917
I'll help you,
as long as you don't tell her anything.

639
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,542
-What?
-Georg, it's for her own protection.

640
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:20,833
This could be right for the Spiegel.
I'm friends with an editor there.

641
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,875
Gregor Hessenstein. Know him?

642
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,458
-Not personally.
-You have to meet him.

643
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,375
But you can't publish using your real name.

644
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:35,167
Unless your idea of fun
is a 48-hour interrogation.

645
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,167
I'm cold.

646
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,333
We could go to my place?

647
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:44,083
There's no State Security at my place.

648
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:48,583
A friend of Margot Honecker,
winner of the National Award...

649
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:52,167
-Second class.
-My apartment is clean, I tell you.

650
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,250
If only we could be sure...

651
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,083
I have an idea
how we can check your apartment.

652
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,917
You know my Uncle Frank

653
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,583
who visits from West Berlin every Saturday

654
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:10,208
with his big gold Mercedes.

655
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,750
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.

656
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:17,208
Yes, I agree with Georg.

657
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,250
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?

658
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,417
I'm really not sure.

659
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,875
Come on, they won't search under the seats.

660
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,417
They'll look under the axles,
tap the exhaust,

661
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,208
then I'll be across. Paul, too.

662
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:35,333
The border guards aren't very bright.

663
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,542
You've got the wrong idea there.

664
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,375
Which border will you cross?

665
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,375
Heinrich-Heine Street.
Always Heinrich-Heine Street.

666
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,667
They know me and my gold Mercedes.

667
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,667
I'm friends with the guards.

668
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:55,833
Trust me, I'll call you in two hours,
a Schultheiss beer in my hand

669
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,500
and report the news: Paul's across.

670
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,708
No!

671
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,917
-What about Paul's Stasi man?
-Rolf.

672
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,250
Rolfy, Rolfy...

673
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,583
He'll think that Paul's at home.

674
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,500
Okay, I have to go.

675
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:15,958
We wouldn't want him to suffocate,
would we?

676
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,458
It'd be a shame.

677
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:24,792
Okay, take care!

678
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:30,083
Heinrich-Heine Street

679
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,083
Another beer?

680
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,875
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.

681
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:45,583
Who is this?

682
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,500
Who is this?

683
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,042
No reply.

684
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:58,167
Just this once, my friend.

685
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,583
-Dreyman.
-Okay, Paul's plan worked!

686
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:29,333
-No border control at all?
-No.

687
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:35,292
No special checks. Those boys aren't
so bad. It worked as planned.

688
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,375
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.

689
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:43,042
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.

690
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,583
Yeah, true.

691
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:47,750
See you soon, and thanks a lot.

692
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:48,875
Bye.

693
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:01,958
What do we do if they ask
what we're doing together?

694
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:09,750
Then... We'll say...

695
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:15,792
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.

696
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,917
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.

697
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:20,917
Yes.

698
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,125
And it's kind of true.

699
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:31,625
Who'd have thought our State Security
was so incompetent?

700
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,667
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?

701
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,000
Just you wait...

702
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:59,167
7:32 p.m.

703
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:06,250
No further noteworthy incidents.

704
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:23,250
Hello, Comrade. Listen to this here.

705
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,708
Sure, in 1967

706
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,917
there were many suicides.
But why in 1977? You must explain.

707
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,917
You must describe
the social conditions more clearly.

708
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:40,458
It should remain literature,
not political agitation.

709
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:45,625
The text is great. I just want to be
sure people understand it in the West.

710
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,042
It'll cause a sensation either way.

711
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:52,500
-That's Hauser.
-Of course it's Hauser.

712
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:54,583
He's not in the West.

713
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,958
They're writing a play together.

714
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,667
For the 40th anniversary.

715
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,458
It doesn't sound like a play to me.

716
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,083
No? Then what?

717
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,833
I don't know, but not a play.

718
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,917
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.

719
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:28,250
-You're not an intellectual, are you?
-Me? No...

720
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,583
-I'm not one of those.
-Then don't behave like one.

721
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,708
I chose you because you know
the equipment and don't ask questions.

722
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,833
-Leave the thinking to your superiors.
-Yes, Captain.

723
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:44,500
I'll be off, then.

724
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,708
Have a nice day of work...

725
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,250
I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.

726
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,500
Maybe I can rewrite this part.

727
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:02,792
I'll send you all the material we have.

728
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,333
Can you do it in two weeks?

729
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:10,083
Then I could run it as a cover story
for the first week in March.

730
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:15,000
It's Christa.

731
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,833
Georg?

732
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:20,708
Christa,

733
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,917
this is Gregor Hessenstein.

734
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,833
-Christa Sieland.
-Of course, I know that.

735
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:29,750
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?

736
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,708
Hauser and I are writing a play

737
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,875
-for the GDR's 40th anniversary.
-Together?

738
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,250
The Spiegel may do an article on it.

739
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:42,083
-And who'll play the lead role?
-We planned to ask you.

740
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:46,208
Christa, who would you rather play:
Lenin or his dear old mother?

741
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:47,917
You can choose.

742
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:52,333
I see I'm not welcome here. I'll go for a nap.

743
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,208
Your caution is praise worthy.

744
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:08,500
The fewer people know, the better.
The Stasi is not to be toyed with.

745
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,833
On that note, I brought something for you.

746
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,625
I'd have preferred the whole pie.
I already have a typewriter.

747
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,625
The Stasi can identify its typeface.

748
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:34,250
If they intercepted the text at the border,
you'd end up in Hohenschonhausen.

749
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,667
And that's no fun,
as Paul can confirm, right?

750
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:44,625
I'm afraid I could only get
a red ink ribbon for this model.

751
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,083
-Do you mind writing it in red?
-That won't be a problem.

752
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:53,375
Is there somewhere you can hide it?

753
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:57,458
-Yes, I'll find a place.
-Don't take it lightly.

754
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:03,125
I don't want my next article to be
about your disappearance!

755
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:06,083
Nobody may know
that this typewriter exists!

756
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,500
-Is apartment really safe?
-Yes.

757
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:17,833
It's the only place left in the GDR
where I can say what I want.

758
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:21,083
Fine, then let's drink to that.

759
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,750
This is the real stuff.

760
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:32,750
To you. To letting all of Germany
see the true face of the GDR.

761
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,042
Cheers.

762
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:45,458
It's better than the Russian stuff.
To your success.

763
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:07,125
-I must see Comrade Grubitz.
-Out of the question.

764
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:12,208
-Do you know what we've invested...
-Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m...

765
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,958
Tell him that if he blows the cover,

766
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:19,083
we'll shut down the entire parish!

767
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,583
He can call the Pope and complain!

768
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:25,792
Okay, I've spent enough time
on this nonsense.

769
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,000
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.

770
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:31,792
I have to show you something.

771
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:37,083
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists.

772
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:40,000
"Based on Character Profile."
Pretty scientific, eh?

773
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:42,542
And look at this.

774
01:21:44,792 --> 01:21:49,792
"Dissertation Supervisor: A. Grubitz."
That's great, isn't it?

775
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:54,458
I only gave him a B.

776
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,833
They shouldn't think getting
a doctorate with me is easy.

777
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,417
But this is first-class.

778
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,792
Did you know that there are
just five types of artists?

779
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:08,625
Your guy, Dreyman, is a Type 4.

780
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,625
A "hysterical anthropocentrist."

781
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:15,042
Can't bear being alone, always talking,
needing friends.

782
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:18,750
That type should never be brought to trial.
They thrive on that.

783
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:23,958
Temporary detention is
the best way to deal with them.

784
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:27,417
Complete isolation and no set release date.

785
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:31,292
No human contact the whole time,
not even with the guards.

786
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:36,000
Good treatment, no harassment,
no abuse, no scandals,

787
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,667
nothing they could write about later.

788
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:42,208
After 10 months, we release.

789
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:46,750
Suddenly, that guy won't
cause us any more trouble.

790
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,958
Know what the best part is?

791
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:52,708
Most Type 4s we've processed in this way

792
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:58,625
never write anything again.
Or paint anything, or whatever artists do...

793
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:01,958
And that without any use of force.
Just like that.

794
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:04,083
Kind of

795
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:06,625
like a present.

796
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,500
What brings you here?

797
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:12,917
-Developments with Dreyman?
-That's why I'm here.

798
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,583
I think the time has come...

799
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,875
For what?

800
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:23,375
For us to slim down the operation.

801
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,625
I don't want to run day and night shifts

802
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,083
-for such an uncertain case.
-Uncertain, huh?

803
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:35,917
You don't think we'll find anything
for the Minister?

804
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:38,667
Maybe if we're more flexible.

805
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:42,583
If we watch "Lazlo"
outside his own four walls.

806
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:49,083
Shall I give the case to Udo?

807
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,750
I'd like to continue it myself.

808
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:56,917
-Why?
-It could produce results.

809
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,417
I just need to plan more flexibly.

810
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,917
When I come and go, days and nights...

811
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,917
Maybe he's up to something outside.

812
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:16,083
Something doesn't feel right here.

813
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:21,250
There's something you're hiding.

814
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,083
All right, I'll take Udo off the case.

815
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:38,458
I can use him for this church case.
Give me a request in writing.

816
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:42,250
Write as a reason, "Lack of suspicious acts."

817
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,333
And, Wiesler!

818
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:55,083
A piece of advice for you:
We're not at school anymore.

819
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:58,750
Projects aren't about grades, but success.

820
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:21,333
"The state statistics office
counts everything, knows everything.

821
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:26,750
"How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

822
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:32,750
"And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347."

823
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:53,917
5:00 p.m. "Lazlo" reads the first act
of his anniversary play

824
01:25:53,958 --> 01:26:00,958
to Hauser and Wallner.

825
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:41,292
DENTAL PRACTICE

826
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:49,250
-We're not writing a play, Christa.
-You don't have to tell me.

827
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,333
-But I want to. It's a text...
-Don't tell me.

828
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,458
Maybe I am as unreliable
as your friends say.

829
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:00,583
But I...

830
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,750
I'm with you now.

831
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:05,375
No matter what.

832
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:44,917
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report,

833
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,417
said there is no quick fix

834
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,583
for saving damaged forests.

835
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:52,542
East-West German relations under strain.

836
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:55,875
Spiegel magazine today published

837
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:59,875
a text by an unnamed East German author

838
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:03,292
about suicide in
the German Democratic Republic.

839
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:07,583
This follows a series of suicides
by prominent East-Berlin artists,

840
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:10,833
the latest being Albert Jerska.

841
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:14,000
After being blacklisted for seven years,

842
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:17,000
Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.

843
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:19,917
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing

844
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,167
any data relating to suicides.

845
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:26,708
That year, Hungary was the only country
in Europe with a higher suicide rate.

846
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,250
Yes, sir...

847
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:33,625
You failed miserably, Grubitz,
you incompetent amateur!

848
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:38,833
General, our man at the Spiegel
got us a Photostat of the original.

849
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,458
Congratulations! So who wrote it?

850
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:44,958
He doesn't know,
but using the typeface, we'll...

851
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,208
You're hopeless! Get me names!

852
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,250
I will, as soon as we get the results.

853
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,417
If not, you'll be put against the wall.

854
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:02,167
Andrea, where's the graphologist?

855
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:06,625
Thus I conclude that
it is a domestic typewriter,

856
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:11,750
produced for export,
most likely a "Kolibri" travel model,

857
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:16,125
made by the VEB Groma. If the ink
were black, I could be more precise.

858
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:22,458
-Who owns such a typewriter?
-There are none registered in the GDR.

859
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,083
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?

860
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:29,875
Paul Hauser uses a "Valentino" typewriter,
made by Olivetti.

861
01:30:29,917 --> 01:30:32,500
That model has a more horizontal...

862
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:34,125
Yes, yes! And Wallner?

863
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,542
He writes on an Optima "Elite."

864
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:44,208
-Georg Dreyman?
-He writes his first drafts by hand,

865
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:47,583
then types them up
on a Wanderer "Torpedo."

866
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,500
He's never used anything else.

867
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:55,750
How big is this Kolibri typewriter?

868
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:59,250
It's one of the smallest available:

869
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:02,833
19.5 cm x 9 cm x 19.5 cm.

870
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:06,250
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.

871
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:11,667
Thank you. You may go.

872
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,417
Goodbye, Comrade.

873
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:26,833
GDR
THE SECRET SUICIDE STATISTICS

874
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,208
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler.

875
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:32,624
4:00 p.m.
The group is exhausted

876
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:38,583
4:00 p.m.
The group is exhausted

877
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:43,917
from so much writing.

878
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,833
STAFF INTERNAL

879
01:31:55,917 --> 01:31:58,875
-Yes?
-Have you heard about this article?

880
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,417
-In the Spiegel? Yes.
-How so?

881
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:06,458
Hauser called Dreyman
and told him about it.

882
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,625
Wiesler, this is very important.

883
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:11,958
Both for my career and for yours.

884
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:17,167
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?

885
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:22,333
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No, nothing at all.

886
01:32:25,292 --> 01:32:30,917
A Spiegel editor crossed the border
using a false name on the 27th

887
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,333
and spent four hours here.
Real name: Gregor Hessenstein.

888
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:38,458
Department VI followed him
to Prenzlauer Berg, then lost his trail.

889
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:41,000
Did he have contact with Dreyman?

890
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,667
-Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
-Yes, of course.

891
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:49,083
But I smell a writer behind this text.

892
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:53,333
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.
So keep your ears open.

893
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,042
Shit.

894
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:19,833
Get in.

895
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:38,792
If one of your staff deceives you,
you punish him, right?

896
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:42,083
-Sure, sure!
-Even a woman,

897
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:45,833
-right?
-But of course.

898
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,417
Isn't everyone who serves a great man

899
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,417
part of his staff?

900
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:57,250
You could see it like that...
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.

901
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:04,042
This is where she gets her illegal
medication. Christa-Maria Sieland.

902
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,792
You should know this, it's your department.

903
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:14,000
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not,

904
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:18,708
but I never want to see her
on a German stage again.

905
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,083
Now get out.

906
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,250
Shut the door!

907
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:37,625
Ms. Sieland? Please follow us.
We have some questions.

908
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,417
Come along.

909
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:03,667
So...

910
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:08,708
Comrade Sieland,
a beautiful career you had, huh?

911
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,333
A pity really. You were good.

912
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:14,917
You were very good indeed.

913
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,083
Just too short-lived.

914
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,125
Do have a seat.

915
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:31,583
What do actors do
when they can't act anymore?

916
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:37,792
Please...

917
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:42,417
Isn't there anything I can do for you?

918
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:48,250
For... State Security?

919
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,500
It's a little late for that.

920
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:54,417
I know nearly all our artists.

921
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:57,292
-I could find out a lot.
-I believe you.

922
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,917
But it won't help you now.

923
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:13,208
Maybe there's something else I could do?

924
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,375
Something we might both find agreeable.

925
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,250
Unfortunately, you've made

926
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:28,500
an enemy of a very powerful man.

927
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:32,917
Therefore, I have less freedom
than would normally be the case.

928
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,833
Is there no way I can save myself?

929
01:36:39,542 --> 01:36:41,083
I'm sorry, madam.

930
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,583
There is one possibility.

931
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:57,958
Since you spend so much time with writers

932
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,250
and artists...

933
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:07,083
You don't know anything about an article
from this week's Spiegel, do you?

934
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:09,208
An article about suicide.

935
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,417
State Security! Open the door!

936
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:13,958
Open up!

937
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:21,500
He's turned on the light in his study.

938
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:24,500
Go in before he destroys any evidence.

939
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:26,208
Crowbar!

940
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:31,875
I don't think that'll be necessary.

941
01:38:33,042 --> 01:38:34,250
What's the matter, Comrades?

942
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:37,583
We have a warrant to search the premises.

943
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:41,208
-What are you looking for?
-It's confidential.

944
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,625
Boysen, Mller: bedroom.
Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.

945
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:49,792
Heise and Thomas: living room, study. Go!

946
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,708
What do you burn in here?

947
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:45,583
Substandard texts.

948
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,208
A lot of Western literature, huh?

949
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:57,667
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.

950
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:04,083
-Status?
-All according to plan.

951
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:12,875
We found nothing,
except Western books and newspapers.

952
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:17,125
No trace to be found.

953
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:18,917
Did you search thoroughly?

954
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:20,917
Yes, Comrade.

955
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,542
What's our next move?

956
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,708
Comrade?

957
01:40:29,917 --> 01:40:31,333
Pull out your men.

958
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:38,542
In the unlikely event that damage has
occurred, you may claim compensation.

959
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,958
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.

960
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:06,292
Yes?

961
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:10,292
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you in
Hohenschonhausen at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

962
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:17,625
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:
It was Christa-Maria.

963
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:20,792
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.

964
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:24,958
It wasn't her.

965
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:27,208
How can you be so sure?

966
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,083
You yourself said
she wasn't home last night.

967
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:36,000
She knows the hiding place.

968
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:39,083
Yes, she knows.

969
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:48,667
So if you're right,
and the search was due to her,

970
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,833
then she's our guardian angel.

971
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm here to see Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz.

972
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:02,458
Captain Wiesler.

973
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:04,917
Interrogation Room 76.

974
01:42:22,167 --> 01:42:23,667
Yes! Come in.

975
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:29,833
Sit down.

976
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:38,083
So?

977
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:43,167
What was that about?

978
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:45,500
You're asking me what that was about?

979
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,958
What do you suspect Dreyman of?

980
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,250
He wrote the Spiegel article.

981
01:42:58,917 --> 01:43:00,250
Who alleges that?

982
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,500
Come with me.

983
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:17,208
Here.

984
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:23,375
I don't know how you could be so sloppy
as to miss all of this.

985
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:27,417
But I know you differently,
especially as an interrogator.

986
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,125
So I'm giving you one last chance.

987
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:33,333
Bring in prisoner 662, now.

988
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:40,417
Are you still on the right side?

989
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:47,250
-Yes.
-Then don't screw it up again.

990
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,167
Shall I restrain the prisoner?

991
01:44:15,042 --> 01:44:17,625
No, she's an informant now. You may go.

992
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:26,667
So you're my commanding officer?

993
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:28,375
Write.

994
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:30,625
Then command me.

995
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,417
In another 10 hours...

996
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,250
No, in nine and a half...

997
01:44:53,542 --> 01:44:58,542
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that
you, for health reasons, cannot appear.

998
01:45:00,583 --> 01:45:03,958
And that will be your last mention
in the acting world.

999
01:45:06,042 --> 01:45:07,583
Is that what you want?

1000
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:12,833
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.

1001
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:18,250
There is no evidence, and no typewriter.

1002
01:45:18,417 --> 01:45:19,750
I made it all up.

1003
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,708
I hope not.

1004
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:26,292
If so, we'll have to keep you here.

1005
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:31,542
A false statement is perjury,
which carries around two years in prison.

1006
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,833
Dreyman will go to prison anyway

1007
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:39,333
on account of your statement

1008
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:44,625
and the material
we've already found in the apartment.

1009
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:50,625
Save yourself, at least.

1010
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:57,250
You have no idea how many people
are in jail here for senseless heroics.

1011
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,750
Don't forget audience.

1012
01:46:03,417 --> 01:46:07,083
"Don't forget audience."
He has some funny ideas.

1013
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:14,708
Don't forget
what the state has done for you...

1014
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,417
Your whole life long.

1015
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:22,708
Now you can do something for the state.
And it will thank you.

1016
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,750
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.

1017
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:32,958
Dreyman will never find out.

1018
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:35,750
I'll let you go immediately,

1019
01:46:36,292 --> 01:46:38,583
and we'll strike
only after you're back with him.

1020
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:43,250
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.

1021
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:47,458
And tonight you'll be back on stage.

1022
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,833
In your element.

1023
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,083
In front of your audience.

1024
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:07,625
Tell me where the documents are.

1025
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:19,583
Where are they?

1026
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:26,167
They're in the apartment.

1027
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,750
Under the door sill,

1028
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:34,083
between the living room

1029
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:37,208
and the hallway.

1030
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:41,708
You can remove it.

1031
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:58,208
Is this where you mean?

1032
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,583
Mark the exact place with a cross.

1033
01:48:30,917 --> 01:48:34,917
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.

1034
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:38,833
That means responsibilities,
like conspiracy and confidentiality,

1035
01:48:38,917 --> 01:48:42,333
but also privileges...

1036
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:06,750
Guard!

1037
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:12,250
-Call Wiesler for me.
-Colonel Wiesler has left the premises.

1038
01:49:12,417 --> 01:49:13,583
I see.

1039
01:49:16,042 --> 01:49:17,625
All right. Stand down.

1040
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:37,417
What does a rider do when he's thrown?
He gets back on again.

1041
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:42,875
Go inside. Sleep it off. What happened
has nothing to do with the house.

1042
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,125
No, but with the whole country.

1043
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:52,583
Christa!

1044
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:56,292
Stop, I was at Kerschner's'
and they had no water. I need a shower.

1045
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:17,583
You were in a hurry to get here.

1046
01:51:17,667 --> 01:51:20,250
-Operation "Lazlo" is still in progress.
-Are they both inside?

1047
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:21,375
Yes.

1048
01:51:23,292 --> 01:51:24,875
Here's today's report.

1049
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:28,792
The last report for Operation "Lazlo."

1050
01:51:50,542 --> 01:51:53,417
-Why didn't you call me?
-What?

1051
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,833
Why didn't you call me?

1052
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,708
I was out in the country.

1053
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:03,833
Can you hand me the nail brush?

1054
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:11,750
The Stasi was here.
They searched the apartment.

1055
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:14,292
Who was here?

1056
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,167
State Security! Open up!

1057
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:20,500
Stay here.

1058
01:52:29,417 --> 01:52:30,417
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.

1059
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,917
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz
from State Security.

1060
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:36,958
I just wanted to make sure
they did a thorough job last night.

1061
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:39,458
Your study? We'll start there.

1062
01:52:48,708 --> 01:52:51,583
Men, search carefully
for notes hidden in the books.

1063
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:12,917
Oh, what do we have here?

1064
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:18,333
This door sill doesn't look kosher to me.

1065
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,125
Could it be a secret compartment?

1066
01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:43,417
Let her go. She's not a suspect.

1067
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:00,667
The actress...

1068
01:54:32,667 --> 01:54:36,083
I was too weak. I can never put right

1069
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:38,792
-what I've done wrong.
-There's nothing to put right!

1070
01:54:38,917 --> 01:54:41,750
You understand? Nothing. I moved the...

1071
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:55,583
Forgive me, forgive me...

1072
01:54:56,375 --> 01:54:58,708
Forgive me, forgive me...

1073
01:55:29,042 --> 01:55:32,417
Take your men back to headquarters.
This mission is over.

1074
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:50,333
I've concluded the mission,
Comrade Dreyman.

1075
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:54,250
We must have received an erroneous tip-off.
Sorry.

1076
01:55:57,542 --> 01:55:58,583
Come on.

1077
01:56:58,417 --> 01:57:01,208
There's one thing
you should understand, Wiesler.

1078
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,750
Your career is over.

1079
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,750
Even if you were too smart
to leave any traces.

1080
01:57:09,417 --> 01:57:13,958
You'll end up in some cellar,
steam-opening letters until you retire.

1081
01:57:14,708 --> 01:57:16,583
That means the next 20 years.

1082
01:57:17,167 --> 01:57:18,375
20 years.

1083
01:57:20,417 --> 01:57:21,917
That's a long time.

1084
01:57:31,542 --> 01:57:33,583
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV ELECTED
AS LEADER

1085
01:57:33,708 --> 01:57:35,583
OF THE SOVIET UNION'S
COMMUNIST PARTY

1086
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:41,583
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER

1087
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:01,792
The Wall has come down.

1088
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,583
Yes, the Wall has come down.

1089
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:17,917
The border guards have opened the gates.
The excitement is enormous!

1090
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:21,417
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!

1091
01:58:21,792 --> 01:58:26,708
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989,
will go down in history!

1092
01:58:26,917 --> 01:58:29,250
A young family stands in front of me...

1093
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:54,750
TWO YEARS LATER

1094
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:01,250
What's wrong, my child?

1095
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:03,917
Your Arthur is dead.

1096
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:08,375
Arthur...

1097
01:59:09,583 --> 01:59:13,500
Can't you be wrong, just this once?
I saw him this morning!

1098
01:59:13,917 --> 01:59:17,083
No, sister. Believe me. He fell to his death.

1099
01:59:18,667 --> 01:59:21,208
The loyal men surround him, as you do me,

1100
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,083
and despite the high sun,

1101
01:59:24,167 --> 01:59:28,208
cast seven shadows
on his noble dead body.

1102
01:59:29,375 --> 01:59:31,500
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

1103
01:59:32,417 --> 01:59:33,667
I see it,

1104
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:36,375
though I'd rather see any other horror.

1105
01:59:39,417 --> 01:59:41,833
Why am I not spared these visions?

1106
01:59:43,583 --> 01:59:47,417
Elena! Go home and mourn.

1107
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,417
I will finish your shift.

1108
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:01,875
Too many memories, huh?

1109
02:00:06,917 --> 02:00:08,917
I couldn't stay in there either.

1110
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,833
But what's this I hear?

1111
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:17,250
You've not written since the Wall fell?

1112
02:00:18,417 --> 02:00:19,750
That's not good.

1113
02:00:21,625 --> 02:00:23,792
After all our country invested in you.

1114
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:27,458
Although I understand you, Dreyman.

1115
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:30,750
What is there to write about
in this new Germany?

1116
02:00:31,583 --> 02:00:35,083
Nothing to believe in,
nothing to rebel against...

1117
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:41,292
Life was good in our little Republic.

1118
02:00:42,292 --> 02:00:44,083
Many people only realize that now.

1119
02:00:45,167 --> 02:00:48,917
-There is one thing I do need to ask you.
-Whatever you want.

1120
02:00:49,917 --> 02:00:51,667
Why was I never under surveillance?

1121
02:00:53,417 --> 02:00:54,667
Everyone else was.

1122
02:00:55,042 --> 02:00:56,167
Why not me?

1123
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:04,167
You were under full surveillance.

1124
02:01:05,542 --> 02:01:07,125
We knew everything about you.

1125
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:09,917
Full surveillance?

1126
02:01:11,292 --> 02:01:12,833
Every inch was bugged.

1127
02:01:13,708 --> 02:01:14,917
The full program.

1128
02:01:16,042 --> 02:01:17,042
Impossible.

1129
02:01:19,917 --> 02:01:22,250
Take a look behind your light switches.

1130
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,708
We knew everything.

1131
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:29,750
We knew that you couldn't give

1132
02:01:30,167 --> 02:01:32,250
our little Christa what she needed.

1133
02:01:38,417 --> 02:01:41,417
To think that people like you
once ruled a country...

1134
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,250
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL

1135
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:13,417
Visitors Welcome

1136
02:03:18,917 --> 02:03:23,250
It'll be a moment, there should be
more than one file in your case.

1137
02:04:07,375 --> 02:04:11,083
I ordered them chronologically.
Old ones at the top

1138
02:04:11,292 --> 02:04:13,250
and the newer ones underneath.

1139
02:04:14,583 --> 02:04:15,750
My respects.

1140
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:35,833
OPERATION "LAZLO"

1141
02:04:38,375 --> 02:04:41,208
Operation "Lazlo," subject: Georg Dreyman,

1142
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:43,250
code name: "Lazlo," is launched.

1143
02:04:43,917 --> 02:04:47,083
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.

1144
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:51,833
"Lazlo" takes delivery

1145
02:04:51,917 --> 02:04:56,250
of a daily Western newspaper
without official permission.

1146
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:59,833
I suggest not taking any action

1147
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:02,750
so as not to arouse suspicion
of surveillance.

1148
02:05:04,542 --> 02:05:06,917
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents,

1149
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:09,417
then presumably have intercourse.

1150
02:05:19,583 --> 02:05:23,250
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle
from West Berlin.

1151
02:05:23,917 --> 02:05:26,083
They tell him about a play

1152
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:30,292
that Hauser and "Lazlo" will write
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

1153
02:05:34,458 --> 02:05:37,333
We expect further information on the play,

1154
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:39,417
a plot summary, etc.

1155
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:43,667
Contents of first act:

1156
02:05:44,625 --> 02:05:46,833
Lenin is in constant danger.

1157
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:51,833
Despite increasing external pressure,
he sticks to his revolutionary plans.

1158
02:05:54,083 --> 02:05:55,875
Lenin is exhausted.

1159
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:04,083
HGW...

1160
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:08,167
HGW XX/7 ...

1161
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,167
I, Christa-Maria Sieland,

1162
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:26,792
freely commit myself to work unofficially

1163
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:29,833
for State Security.

1164
02:06:30,542 --> 02:06:33,125
This decision is the result
of my conviction that...

1165
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:42,917
Georg Dreyman wrote the Spiegel article,

1166
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."

1167
02:06:45,083 --> 02:06:47,917
His accomplices were
the journalist Paul Hauser...

1168
02:06:57,250 --> 02:07:00,500
Christa-Maria Sieland was
arrested on March 10th

1169
02:07:00,583 --> 02:07:03,792
for drug abuse,
on Minister Hempf's indication.

1170
02:07:04,458 --> 02:07:07,500
She was released at 1:50 p.m.
on March 11th,

1171
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,833
having revealed "Lazlo's" hiding place

1172
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,833
and signing up as informant "Marta."

1173
02:07:20,542 --> 02:07:21,958
1:50 p.m...

1174
02:07:24,417 --> 02:07:25,667
So when did she...

1175
02:07:25,958 --> 02:07:30,333
After the unsuccessful house search
of March 11, 1985

1176
02:07:30,875 --> 02:07:33,042
and "Marta's" fatal accident,

1177
02:07:33,292 --> 02:07:35,292
Operation "Lazlo" was terminated.

1178
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:43,750
Note: HGW's promotion ban
takes effect immediately.

1179
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,625
Transfer to Department M,
with the recommendation

1180
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:51,167
not to entrust him with missions
under his sole responsibility.

1181
02:07:53,042 --> 02:07:57,583
10:50a.m.: Resume surveillance
outside "Lazlo's" house.

1182
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:02,958
At 3:10 p.m., "Marta" comes directly

1183
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:05,708
from Hohenschonhausen to his apartment.

1184
02:08:05,917 --> 02:08:08,542
House search and report to follow.

1185
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:11,750
End of Operation "Lazlo."

1186
02:08:11,833 --> 02:08:14,542
HGW, 3:15 p.m.

1187
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:34,250
Who is HGW XX/7?

1188
02:09:19,625 --> 02:09:20,667
Stop.

1189
02:10:11,917 --> 02:10:13,583
Back to Hufeland Street.

1190
02:10:39,083 --> 02:10:41,917
TWO YEARS LATER

1191
02:10:46,708 --> 02:10:52,417
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN

1192
02:11:11,333 --> 02:11:12,375
Hello.

1193
02:11:20,083 --> 02:11:27,083
GEORG DREYMAN
SONATA FOR A GOOD MAN

1194
02:11:32,417 --> 02:11:33,667
A NOVEL

1195
02:11:35,083 --> 02:11:39,500
DEDICATED TO HGW XX/7 ,
In GRATITUDE.

1196
02:11:58,917 --> 02:12:00,125
29.80.

1197
02:12:01,042 --> 02:12:02,583
Shall I gift-wrap it?

1198
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:05,083
No, it's for me.
