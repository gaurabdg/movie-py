<i>Beautiful friend</i>

3

<i>This is the end</i>

4
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:31,682
<i>My only friend</i>

<i>The end</i>

<i>The end</i>

9
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,487
<i>The end</i>

10
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:49,491
<i>No safety nor surprise</i>

11
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:51,577
<i>The end</i>

12
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:57,416
<i>I'll never look into your eyes</i>

13
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,585
<i>Again</i>

14

<i>Can you picture</i>

15
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,927
<i>What will be</i>

16
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:14,224
<i>So limitless and free</i>

17
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,020
<i>Desperately in need</i>

18
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:20,022
<i>Of some</i>

<i>Wilderness of pain</i>

24
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:30,676
<i>And all the children</i>

25

29
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:56,159

30
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,021
<i>Saigon. </i>

31
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,941
<i>Shit. </i>

32
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,946
<i>I'm still only in Saigon. </i>

33
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:44,376
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle. </i>

34
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,678
<i>When I was home after
my first tour, it was worse. </i>

35
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:04,526
<i>I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing. </i>

36
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:16,373
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce. </i>

37
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,213
<i>When I was here,
I wanted to be there. </i>

38
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:28,177
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle. </i>

39
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:33,226
<i>I'm here a week now. </i>

40
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,774
<i>Waiting for a mission... </i>

41
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,318
<i>getting softer. </i>

42
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:49,452
<i>Every minute I stay
in this room, I get weaker. </i>

43
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger. </i>

44
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,010
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter. </i>

45
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:18,028
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

46
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:23,993
<i>Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah</i>

47
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:27,915
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

48
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,418
<i>Fuck, yeah, come on, baby</i>

49
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,922
<i>Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck</i>

50
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,299

52
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:43,807

00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,718

57
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,930
<i>Yeah</i>

58
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:45,546
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants. </i>

59
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,383
<i>I wanted a mission... </i>

60
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:52,304
<i>and for my sins,
they gave me one. </i>

61
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,807
<i>Brought it up to me
like room service. </i>

62
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,604
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?

63
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,772
Yeah, I'm comin'.

64
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,692
<i>It was a real choice mission. </i>

65
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:08,156
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another. </i>

66
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,960
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

67
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,963
What does it look like?

68
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,976
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

69
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:34,979
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:39,609
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?

71
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:44,323
We have orders to escort you
to the airfield.

72
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,827
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

73
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:51,248
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.

74
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:55,169
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.

75
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:58,172
- I see.
- All right?

76
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:01,260
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

77
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:04,763
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

78
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,893
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

79
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,231
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

80
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:15,359
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

81
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:17,571
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.

82
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:19,906
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.

83
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:23,536
Stand underneath this, Captain.

84
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,050
<i>I was going to the worst place
in the world... </i>

85
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,928
<i>and I didn't even know it yet. </i>

86
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:42,016
<i>Weeks away and hundreds
of miles up a river... </i>

87
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:45,269
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable... </i>

88
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:48,064
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz. </i>

89
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,028
<i>It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker... </i>

90
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,823
<i>of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory... </i>

91
00:09:55,948 --> 00:10:00,703
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident. </i>

92
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,666
<i>There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own. </i>

93
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,378
<i>If his story
is really a confession... </i>

94
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,048
<i>- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- Then so is mine. </i>

95
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:13,302
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:17,389
- Stand at ease.
- General.

97
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:21,061
You want a cigarette?

98
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,689
No, thank you, sir.

99
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:28,236
- Have you ever seen this man before?
- No, sir.

100
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,073
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.

101
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,659
Not personally.

102
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:37,497
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.

103
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,082
Your report
specifies intelligence...

104
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,584
counterintelligence
with Com-Sec, "l" Corps.

105
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,797
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

106
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,476
Did you not work for
the CIA in "l" Corps?

107
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,105
No, sir.

108
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,900
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector...

109
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,778
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?

110
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,783
Captain?

111
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,666
Sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation...

112
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:20,922
nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation...

113
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,718
if it did,
in fact, exist, sir.

114
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,984
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

115
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:41,904
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

116
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,911
I notice that you have
a bad hand there. You wounded?

117
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:49,372
I had a little fishing accident
on R and R, sir.

118
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:53,084
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,588
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

120
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:58,132
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.

121
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:03,805
Well, let's see what we have here,
roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

122
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,311
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.

123
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,482
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

124
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:17,863
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp...

125
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,866
but if you'll eat it...

126
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:24,621
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

127
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:28,626
I swear, why don't I
just take a piece here?

128
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:33,048
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

129
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:37,261
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

130
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:41,224
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.

131
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,895
Luke, would you play that tape
for the captain, please?

132
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,523
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

133
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,988
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King. </i>

134
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:56,284
These were monitored
out of Cambodia.

135
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,120
This has been verified
as Col. Kurtz's voice.

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,636
<i>I do hate them. </i>

158
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,395
Walt Kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers...

159
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,606
this country's ever produced.

160
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:38,819
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

161
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:44,617
And he was a good man, too,
a humanitarian man.

162
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:47,746
A man of wit and humor.

163
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:51,834
He joined the Special Forces.

164
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,672
And after that his...

165
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,884
ideas, methods...

166
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:02,681
became...

167
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:07,060
unsound.

168
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,568
Unsound.

169
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,411
Now he's crossed
into Cambodia with this...

170
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:24,789
Montagnard army of his
that worship...

171
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:27,585
the man like a god...

172
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,590
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.

173
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:36,845
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

174
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:42,518
Col. Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

175
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:46,522
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?

176
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,653
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents...

177
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:54,699
men he believed
were double agents.

178
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:59,996
So he took matters
into his own hands.

179
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:02,708
Well, you see, Willard...

180
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:08,465
in this war, things
get confused out there.

181
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:12,387
Power, ideals,
the old morality...

182
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,348
and practical
military necessity.

183
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,854
But out there
with these natives...

184
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:25,652
it must be a temptation to...

185
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,155
be God.

186
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:34,745
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart...

187
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:38,458
between the rational
and the irrational...

188
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,879
between good and evil...

189
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:44,966
and good does not
always triumph.

190
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,972
Sometimes...

191
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,267
the dark side...

192
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:57,188
overcomes what Lincoln called
the better angels of our nature.

193
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,110
Every man has got
a breaking point.

194
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:04,363
You and I have them.

195
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,368
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

196
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:13,166
And very obviously,
he has gone insane.

197
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:29,309
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

198
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,402
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat...

199
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,492
pick up Col. Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba...

200
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:45,787
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

201
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:49,208
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team by...

202
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:54,213
whatever means available and
terminate the colonel's command.

203
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,182
Terminate the colonel?

204
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:08,397
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint...

205
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,526
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable...

206
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:14,612
human conduct...

207
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:18,909
and he is still on the field,
commanding troops.

208
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:22,496
Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

209
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,376
You understand, Captain,
that this mission...

210
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:31,047
does not exist
nor will it ever exist.

211
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:30,241
<i>How many people
had I already killed? </i>

212
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:34,121
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure... </i>

213
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:38,669
<i>close enough to blow
their last breath in my face. </i>

214
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:43,465
<i>But this time
it was an American... </i>

215
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,593
<i>and an officer. </i>

216
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:59,234
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me... </i>

217
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,404
<i>but it did. </i>

218
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:06,575
<i>Shit. Charging a man
with murder in this place... </i>

219
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:12,249
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

220
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:16,754
<i>I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do? </i>

221
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:22,344
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him. </i>

222
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,356
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,572
<i>I was being ferried down
the coast in a navy PBR... </i>

224
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,701
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat...
a pretty common sight on the rivers. </i>

225
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,705
<i>They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move... </i>

226
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,043
<i>without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay. </i>

227
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,130
<i>I needed the air and the time. </i>

228
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,550
<i>Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone. </i>

229
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,761
Mornin', Captain.

230
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,142
<i>The crew were
mostly just kids... </i>

231
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:07,146
<i>rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves. </i>

232
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:10,859
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

233
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:14,405
<i>The machinist... the one they
called Chef... was from New Orleans. </i>

234
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,408
<i>He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam. </i>

235
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,245
<i>Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans. </i>

236
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:22,289
<i>Lance, on the forward fifties... </i>

237
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,167
<i>was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of L.A. </i>

238
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:29,089
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life. </i>

239
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,179
<i>Clean... Mr. Clean... was
from some South Bronx shit-hole... </i>

240
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,432
<i>and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam... </i>

241
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:41,144
<i>really put the zap on his head. </i>

242
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:45,191
<i>Then there was Phillips,
the chief. </i>

243
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:49,195
<i>It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief’s boat. </i>

244
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,240
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water...

245
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,742
to get into the Nung River.

246
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:57,997
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.

247
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:00,500
Don't worry about it.

248
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:03,713
Don't smoke.

249
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:06,966
You know, I've pulled
a few special ops in here.

250
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,678
About six months ago...

251
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:14,099
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

252
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,894
He was regular army too.

253
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:22,359
Heard he shot himself
in the head.

254
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:34,165
<i>At first I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier. </i>

255
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,834
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead. </i>

256
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:41,339
<i>Third-generation West Point,
top of his class. </i>

257
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:45,677
<i>Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations. </i>

258
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:47,805
<i>Et cetera, et cetera. </i>

259
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:55,314
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape,
and it really put the hook in me... </i>

260
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,028
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man. </i>

261
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,997
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career. </i>

262
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:15,003
<i>Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect. </i>

263
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:19,342
<i>He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation... </i>

264
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:22,763
<i>general, chief of staff,
anything. </i>

265
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:28,477
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam... </i>

266
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:30,939
<i>and things started to slip. </i>

267
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:33,150
<i>His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff... </i>

268
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,695
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted. </i>

269
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:41,159
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them. </i>

270
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,204
<i>During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer... </i>

271
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,377
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted. </i>

272
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,508
<i>Airborne? </i>

273
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,139
<i>He was 38 years old. </i>

274
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,517
<i>Why the fuck would he do that? </i>

275
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:09,108
<i>1966, joins Special Forces... </i>

276
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,194
<i>returns to Vietnam. </i>

277
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:13,488
Hey, what's that?

278
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:16,117
- Arc light.
- What's up?

279
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:18,786
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?

280
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:20,788
- What's that?
- Arc light.

281
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:23,834
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

282
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,836
Charlie don't never
see 'em or hear 'em, man.

283
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:27,213
There they are.

284
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:29,591
Concussion will suck the air
out of your damn lungs.

285
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,718
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

286
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:35,473
Smoke! Secondary burning.

287
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,100
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

288
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,104
Let's have a look, Chief.

289
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,816
<i>It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth... </i>

290
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:45,735
That's them.

291
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,738
<i>our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River. </i>

292
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,700
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometers ahead. </i>

293
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,998
<i>Well, Air Mobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put. </i>

294
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,641
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.

295
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:26,573
<i>First of the Ninth was
an old cavalry division... </i>

296
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,576
<i>that had cashed in its horses
for choppers... </i>

297
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:32,580
<i>and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit. </i>

298
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:37,253
<i>They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time here. </i>

299
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:42,216
<i>What they were mopping up now hadn't
even happened yet an hour ago. </i>

300
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,594
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.

301
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:47,014
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on. Keep going.

302
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,016
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

303
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:52,395
Just go by like you're fighting,
like you're fighting.

304
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:56,066
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.

305
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,152
Just go by. Keep on going.

306
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:00,405
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

307
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,365
All right, come on. Go.

308
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,415
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.

309
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,768
Where can I find the CO?

310
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:30,064
That's the colonel comin' down!

311
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,993
The CO's on that chopper.

312
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:06,773
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 100 yards!

313
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:10,027
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

314
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:15,992
Body cards!

315
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,162
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!

316
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,164
Yes, sir!

317
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:26,004
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

318
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,258
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

319
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:30,635
Captain Willard!

320
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,139
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

321
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,183
I understand Nha Trang
has briefed you...

322
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,185
on the requirements of my mission.

323
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,855
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

324
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,900
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

325
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:46,194
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!

326
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,075
But just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

327
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:56,331
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

328
00:27:56,457 --> 00:28:01,503
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

329
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:04,215
six of clubs, eight of spades.

330
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:07,386
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

331
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:10,389
Four of diamonds.

332
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:14,227
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

333
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:17,647
- What?
- Death cards!

334
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:20,109
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

335
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:26,492
<i>- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you. </i>

336
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:30,329
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

337
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:34,084
<i>This is an area
that is controlled... </i>

338
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,586
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese. </i>

339
00:28:36,712 --> 00:28:38,631
Jim.

340
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,931
<i>We are here to help you. </i>

341
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,020
<i>- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.</i>

342
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,189
<i>-to those who would like to return...
- Everybody in?</i>

343
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:57,611
<i>to the arms of
the South Vietnamese government. </i>

344
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,156
Get in. Hurry up.

345
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,952
Move it out.

346
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,579
<i>This is an area
that is controlled... </i>

347
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,291
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese. </i>

348
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:14,547
Hey! What's this?
What is this?

349
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:17,342
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

350
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:20,888
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

351
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,391
Yeah? What do you have to say?

352
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:29,314
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants
water. He can drink paddy water.

353
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:32,819
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.

354
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:36,072
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

355
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,784
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

356
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,995
He killed a lot of our people!

357
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,247
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts...

358
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,333
strapped on him
can drink from my canteen.

359
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:49,504
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

360
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,426
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

361
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:55,512
Yeah? Here.

362
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:58,557
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have...

363
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,271
What's your name, sailor?

364
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:06,232
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...

365
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:10,404
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:14,658
It's an honor to meet you. I've
admired your nose riding for years.

367
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:17,621
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

368
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:20,373
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.

369
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,502
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

370
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:24,504
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,423
I want you to meet some guys.

372
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:28,425
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.

373
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,386
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.

374
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,640
None of us are anywhere
near your class though.

375
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,183
No way.

376
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:39,187
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.

377
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:41,649
Fly down to Yung Tau
for the evening glass.

378
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:44,193
Been riding since you got here?

379
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,905
No way. I haven't surfed
since I been here.

380
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,407
Through Christ, our Lord...

381
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:51,577
from Whom
all good things come...

382
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,288
through Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit.

383
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,251
All glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father.

384
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,795
Let us bring
our iniquities to the Father...

385
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,839
in the words our Savior gave us.

386
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:06,886
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

387
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:11,642
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

388
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,562
Give us this day
our daily bread...

389
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,565
and forgive us our trespasses...

390
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,775
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us. </i>

391
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:22,530
<i>Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. </i>

392
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:35,336
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself. </i>

393
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,589
<i>They choppered in
the T-bones and the beer... </i>

394
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:40,968
<i>and turned the LZ
into a beach party. </i>

395
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:44,054
<i>The more they tried
to make it just like home... </i>

396
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,808
<i>the more they made
everybody miss it. </i>

397
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:50,103
Make my meat rare...
rare but not cold.

398
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:59,323
<i>Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess. </i>

399
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:02,951
<i>He loved his boys,
and you felt safe with him. </i>

400
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:06,331
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him. </i>

401
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:10,251
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here. </i>

402
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:14,215
What happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

403
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:25,311
Airborne.

404
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,899
Sir, two places we can
get into the river.

405
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:32,027
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

406
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:36,991
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm sure of.

407
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:40,120
That village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy.

408
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:42,540
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

409
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,542
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

410
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:47,045
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

411
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,382
What's the name of
that goddam village? Vin Drin...

412
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:52,844
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

413
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,556
Damn gook names
all sound the same.

414
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:59,685
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

415
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,687
That's a fantastic peak.

416
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,231
- Peak?
- About six foot.

417
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,027
It's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide...

418
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,322
with a bowl section
that's unbelievable.

419
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,825
It's just tube city.

420
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,081
Why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

421
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,876
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

422
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,879
It's all goddam beach break.

423
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,923
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.

424
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:30,261
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

425
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:32,764
Sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

426
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,934
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

427
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,936
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

428
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:41,065
The draught at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

429
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:44,111
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby where you want it.

430
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:46,739
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.

431
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:51,161
Air mobile! I can take that point
and hold it as long as I like.

432
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:54,332
You can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

433
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,834
Hell, a six-foot peak.

434
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,963
Take a gunship
back to the division.

435
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,132
Lance, go with Mike and let him
pick out a board for you.

436
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,426
Bring me my Yater Spoon,
the eight-six.

437
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:06,429
- I don't know, sir...
- What is it, soldier?

438
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:09,599
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

439
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,811
Charlie don't surf!

440
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:38,925
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

441
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:42,930
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

442
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:50,063
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

443
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:53,651
All right, son, let 'er rip.

444
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:56,529
Let's go!

445
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:22,754
I never have got used to a light
board. I can't get used to one.

446
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,758
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

447
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,469
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

448
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:30,472
- Really?
- Yeah!

449
00:36:30,597 --> 00:36:33,267
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

450
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:36,478
<i>- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six. </i>

451
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:38,231
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

452
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:39,899
<i>Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. </i>

453
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:43,444
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.

454
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,906
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in. </i>

455
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:50,077
Hey, Lance, we'll come in
low out of the rising sun.

456
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:52,664
About a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

457
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,126
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

458
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:59,338
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

459
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:01,800
Hey, they're gonna play music!

460
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:12,020
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

461
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,441
So we don't get
our balls blown off.

462
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:29,874
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.

463
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,671
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Fox Trot. Shall we dance?

464
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:42,180
Yes, sir!

465
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:03,344
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.

466
00:40:12,772 --> 00:40:15,859
<i>We got a couple...
at that tree line. </i>

467
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,904
<i>We're taking fire from the holes. </i>

468
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:22,325
Run, Charlie!

469
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:28,582
<i>This should make
everything burn. </i>

470
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:41,598
<i>We got a couple
of people ahead here. </i>

471
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:45,101
<i>-What's going down here?
-We got an automatic! Shoot to kill! </i>

472
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:48,772
<i>-Shoot to kill in the open!
-I spotted a large weapon down below. </i>

473
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:51,275
We're gonna go down
and check it out.

474
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:53,737
<i>All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin' in. </i>

475
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:05,209
What a shot.

476
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:08,128
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.

477
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>Six-four-one-zero,
we're over the village right now. </i>

478
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,452
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.

479
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,871
Well done, Hawks.

480
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,624
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan
along those tree lines.

481
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,669
Ripple the shit out of 'em.

482
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:45,380
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

483
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,592
He's moving across
to resupply the weapon.

484
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:51,929
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself. </i>

485
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:53,848
Don't these people ever give up?

486
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:59,689
Nice shot, Bill.

487
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:03,442
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

488
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:07,990
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!

489
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:10,325
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!

490
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:14,455
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.

491
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:17,709
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

492
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,645
Get down!

493
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.

494
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:15,652
<i>We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza. </i>

495
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,863
<i>Hold on to your position. </i>

496
00:43:17,988 --> 00:43:21,116
<i>Duke Six, we've got
wounded down there. </i>

497
00:43:30,086 --> 00:43:32,547
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

498
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:42,224
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.

499
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,644
My God! Oh!

500
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,981
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?

501
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:50,776
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

502
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,820
I want my men out.

503
00:43:52,946 --> 00:43:55,031
<i>Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke. </i>

504
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:59,411
<i>This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in,
throw 'em on and get out. </i>

505
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,687
She's got a grenade!

506
00:44:21,812 --> 00:44:23,272
She's got a grenade!

507
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:28,194
The whole thing blew up.

508
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,113
<i>- She blew the shit...
- Fucking savages.</i>

509
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,702
<i>- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.</i>

510
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:36,496
<i>I'm gonna get
that dink bitch. </i>

511
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:39,875
<i>Get over there, Johnny. Roll
that right skid right up her ass. </i>

512
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,880
We gotta get some air
in these trees.

513
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:46,341
It's goddam eat-up
with enemy down here.

514
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,509
<i>I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over. </i>

515
00:44:48,636 --> 00:44:50,888
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!

516
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:53,390
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in. </i>

517
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:54,976
<i>My tail rotor's out.
I got control. </i>

518
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:06,781
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.

519
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:10,118
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

520
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:13,914
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.

521
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,960
<i>Look! Good six-foot swells! </i>

522
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,905
Come here, Lance.

523
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,453
Incoming!

524
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:52,126
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.

525
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,169
Maybe you ought to surf
somewhere else.

526
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:55,672
What do you know
about surfing, Major?

527
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:58,508
You're from goddam New Jersey.

528
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,888
Come here! Come here!

529
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,602
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

530
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:10,522
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. Go change.

531
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:12,524
It's still pretty hairy
out there.

532
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,611
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

533
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:17,238
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

534
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:21,075
That clear? Get going.
I'll cover for 'em.

535
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:24,246
And bring a board for Lance.

536
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:26,666
We can't do shit
until the boat gets here.

537
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,128
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

538
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,173
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

539
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:36,260
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think?

540
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:38,430
We ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

541
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:41,516
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!

542
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,524
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours!

543
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:51,737
You wanna wait here
for six hours?

544
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:57,660
Yo! Chief! Chief!

545
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:07,880
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go! </i>

546
00:47:08,006 --> 00:47:10,717
<i>- Dick-heads, take off!
- Goddam it!</i>

547
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:13,345
Don't you think it's
a little risky for R and R?

548
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:17,517
If I say it's safe to surf this
beach, it's safe to surf this beach!

549
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:19,894
I'm not afraid
to surf this place!

550
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,898
I'll surf this fuckin' place.

551
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:27,362
Give me that R-T, soldier.

552
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:31,741
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddam it!

553
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:33,953
<i>I want that tree line bombed! </i>

554
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:36,539
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by. </i>

555
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:38,541
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son! </i>

556
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:41,753
- Out!
- No, back, no!

557
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:45,549
Let me take care of this.
Get that out of here!

558
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:49,137
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

559
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:51,348
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

560
00:47:51,473 --> 00:47:53,434
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three. </i>

561
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:56,979
<i>They need some napalm in the tree
line. Can you put it down there? </i>

562
00:47:57,105 --> 00:48:00,066
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixin'
to fuck with 'em. What's the target? </i>

563
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:03,403
<i>We're trying to suppress some mortar
fire off the tree line down there. </i>

564
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:05,656
<i>- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got. </i>

565
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:08,284
<i>Bring in all your ships. </i>

566
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,164
Put him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

567
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,499
No, no, no,
you got to go with him.

568
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:17,462
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!

569
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:19,464
Tell my guys I want my board!

570
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,467
<i>Big Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three. </i>

571
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:24,970
<i>The jets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to bomb station. </i>

572
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:28,182
<i>Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one. </i>

573
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:31,645
Don't worry.

574
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:35,900
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

575
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:39,445
Give me those shorts.

576
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:43,283
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

577
00:48:43,408 --> 00:48:46,703
I want to see you do your stuff
in 'em out there.

578
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:12,276
You smell that?

579
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,987
- Do you smell that?
- What?

580
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:20,201
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

581
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:24,081
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

582
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:27,042
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

583
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:29,796
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

584
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:33,216
When it was all over,
I walked up.

585
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:38,639
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

586
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:41,810
But the smell...
You know, that gasoline smell.

587
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:46,189
The whole hill smelled like...

588
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:51,446
victory.

589
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,621
Someday this war's gonna end.

590
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:15,098
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?

591
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:17,143
- The wind!
- What?

592
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:20,313
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.

593
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:23,566
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

594
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:26,612
It's the goddam napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

595
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:29,615
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.

596
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:30,951
The kid's got a reputation.

597
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:33,453
You can't expect him
to surf those sloppy waves.

598
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,790
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.

599
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:40,920
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologize. It's not my fault.

600
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:42,506
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm.

601
00:50:42,631 --> 00:50:43,674
Don't get me wrong...

602
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:45,801
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

603
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,804
I accept your apology.

604
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:50,598
But if you could hang
around 20 minutes...

605
00:50:50,723 --> 00:50:53,017
- Some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!

606
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:56,355
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.

607
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,484
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right. </i>

608
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,487
<i>Look, Lance. </i>

609
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:04,489
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

610
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:06,492
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.

611
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:08,494
- You sure?
- Yeah!

612
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,955
<i>- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm. </i>

613
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:13,333
<i>Just wait 20 minutes! </i>

614
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,585
Damn! Fuck!

615
00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:18,548
They've been lookin' for ya.

616
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:22,844
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

617
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,639
Here!

618
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:30,019
Incoming!

619
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:32,063
That's the colonel's surfboard!

620
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:34,524
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!

621
00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:45,370
You fucking Airborne!

622
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:18,910
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

623
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,578
Come on. Let's get high.

624
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,664
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

625
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,210
<i>Someday this war's gonna end. </i>

626
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,213
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat. </i>

627
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,633
<i>They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home. </i>

628
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:36,721
<i>- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there... </i>

629
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:39,892
<i>and I knew that it just
didn't exist any more. </i>

630
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:45,357
Buddha time. Here.

631
00:52:45,482 --> 00:52:49,611
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

632
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:56,787
<i>If that's how Kilgore
fought the war... </i>

633
00:52:56,912 --> 00:53:00,791
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz. </i>

634
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:03,795
<i>It wasn't just
insanity and murder. </i>

635
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,965
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone. </i>

636
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,857
I mean, he never
was hurtin' for pussy.

637
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:25,862
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangos.

638
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:28,907
I meet Raquel Welch.

639
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,665
I make a nice
mango cream pudding.

640
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:39,003
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

641
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:42,840
She's into mangos too.

642
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:45,469
She's like one limb above me.

643
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:49,014
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.

644
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,310
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.

645
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:58,192
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

646
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:00,694
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

647
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,031
<i>I will not hurt
or harm you. </i>

648
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,034
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance. </i>

649
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,455
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it. </i>

650
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:13,000
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

651
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:16,922
<i>- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

652
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,466
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

653
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,345
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance. </i>

654
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,722
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it. </i>

655
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:29,520
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

656
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,564
<i>- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.</i>

657
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:35,276
That guy's too
fuckin' much, man.

658
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,362
Do you think
he would have shot us?

659
00:54:37,488 --> 00:54:39,740
He wouldn't have shot us
on the beach...

660
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:42,618
but he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

661
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:44,913
<i>Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how</i>

662
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,416
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

663
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:48,750
Sucker.

664
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:51,295
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

665
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,842
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

666
00:54:57,845 --> 00:55:00,264
Sock it to me, Lance.

667
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,896
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

668
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:10,192
He's probably got them all over
the river with that recording.

669
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:12,194
We'll have to hold up here
till dark, Chief.

670
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,363
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

671
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:16,199
What makes you say that?

672
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:18,201
You think that big Cav colonel
wants everyone upriver...

673
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:19,786
to know we stole his board?

674
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:21,956
I didn't steal it!

675
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,960
- Captain?
- Hmm?

676
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:29,173
Just how far up
this river we goin'?

677
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:34,094
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.

678
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,222
We're goin' up pretty far.

679
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,560
Is it gonna be hairy?

680
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:45,441
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.

681
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:49,321
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

682
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:51,741
Fuck.

683
00:56:01,336 --> 00:56:03,421
Maybe you'll get
a chance to know...

684
00:56:03,546 --> 00:56:05,924
what the fuck you are
in some factory in Ohio.

685
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:11,012
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go
get those mangos now, okay?

686
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,182
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take...

687
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:15,518
I'll go with him.

688
00:56:20,149 --> 00:56:22,360
Chef?

689
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:25,363
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

690
00:56:25,488 --> 00:56:27,907
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

691
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:32,162
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

692
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:36,376
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

693
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:40,422
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.

694
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:44,969
I was raised to be a saucier,
a great saucier.

695
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:48,306
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

696
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:55,857
Gotta be a mango tree
here somewhere.

697
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:04,324
Then, I was supposed
to go to Paris...

698
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:07,245
study at the Escoffier school.

699
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:12,500
But then I got orders
for my physical.

700
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:25,224
Hell, I joined the navy.

701
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,935
Heard they had better food.

702
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:30,481
Cook school... that did it.

703
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:35,527
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

704
00:57:37,072 --> 00:57:41,284
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

705
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,580
All of us, you know,
lined up lookin' at it.

706
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:48,502
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.

707
00:57:51,756 --> 00:57:55,510
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons...

708
00:57:55,593 --> 00:57:58,596
all of it... boiling it!

709
00:57:58,722 --> 00:58:02,643
I looked inside, man.
It was turning grey.

710
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:05,689
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

711
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:11,569
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me...

712
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:53,035
What is it?

713
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:56,039
Charlie?

714
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,595
It's a tiger!

715
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,808
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

716
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:16,437
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.

717
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:17,814
- Get on your 60!
- Got it.

718
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:22,652
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!

719
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:25,823
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!

720
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:28,117
Let's go!

721
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:30,788
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.

722
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:33,582
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

723
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:37,127
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!

724
00:59:37,253 --> 00:59:39,422
Never get out of the boat!

725
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,553
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!

726
00:59:44,637 --> 00:59:47,181
- What?
- A tiger?

727
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:52,729
Yes! I've had it! I've had
the whole goddam fuckin' shit, man!

728
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,441
You can kiss my ass
on the county square...

729
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:57,485
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

730
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,487
I didn't come here for this.

731
00:59:59,613 --> 01:00:02,241
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.

732
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:06,745
I didn't get out the goddam
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

733
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:09,124
All I wanted to do
was fuckin' cook!

734
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:12,419
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

735
01:00:12,545 --> 01:00:15,423
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?

736
01:00:17,551 --> 01:00:19,886
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

737
01:00:20,011 --> 01:00:23,598
All right?
It's gonna be all right?

738
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:27,186
Never get out
of the fuckin' boat.

739
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:30,773
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Goodbye!

740
01:00:32,484 --> 01:00:34,862
<i>Never get out of the boat. </i>

741
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:37,699
<i>Absolutely goddam right... </i>

742
01:00:38,825 --> 01:00:41,619
<i>unless you were
going all the way. </i>

743
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,794
<i>Kurtz got off the boat. </i>

744
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:53,884
<i>He split from
the whole fuckin' programme. </i>

745
01:00:55,678 --> 01:00:58,264
<i>How did that happen? </i>

746
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,392
<i>What did he see here
that first tour? </i>

747
01:01:07,692 --> 01:01:11,196
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old. </i>

748
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:13,240
<i>If you joined
the Green Berets... </i>

749
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:16,243
<i>there was no way
you'd ever get above colonel. </i>

750
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:20,414
<i>Kurtz knew what
he was giving up. </i>

751
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,418
<i>The more I read
and began to understand... </i>

752
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:26,089
<i>the more I admired him. </i>

753
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:28,883
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it... </i>

754
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:32,637
<i>and they couldn't
talk him out of it. </i>

755
01:01:32,763 --> 01:01:36,225
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit. </i>

756
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:39,604
<i>But when he threatened
to resign, they gave it to him. </i>

757
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:48,072
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age. </i>

758
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:50,784
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man... </i>

759
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:53,286
<i>humping it over that course. </i>

760
01:01:53,412 --> 01:01:57,999
<i>I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me. </i>

761
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:01,963
<i>A tough motherfucker. </i>

762
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,217
<i>He finished it. </i>

763
01:02:07,262 --> 01:02:10,807
<i>He could have gone for general... </i>

764
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:13,810
<i>but he went for himself instead. </i>

765
01:02:16,272 --> 01:02:18,149
Dear Eva...

766
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:20,986
Today was really a new one.

767
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:25,949
Almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin' tiger.

768
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,578
Really un-fucking believable,
you know?

769
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,664
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river...

770
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,835
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.

771
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,837
<i>Come on, baby</i>

772
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:39,340
Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood.

773
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:43,219
<i>October 1967.
On special assignment... </i>

774
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:45,514
<i>Kontoom Province, II Corps. </i>

775
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,643
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces. </i>

776
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,147
<i>Rated a major success. </i>

777
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,820
<i>He received
no official clearance. </i>

778
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:01,657
<i>He just thought it up
and did it. </i>

779
01:03:01,784 --> 01:03:05,037
<i>What balls. </i>

780
01:03:05,162 --> 01:03:08,373
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one. </i>

781
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,086
<i>But after the press
got a hold of it... </i>

782
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:13,379
<i>they promoted him
to full colonel instead. </i>

783
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:19,678
<i>Oh, man, the bullshit
piled up so fast in Vietnam. </i>

784
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:24,351
<i>You needed wings
to stay above it. </i>

785
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:54,177
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

786
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:58,349
Expecting us this time?

787
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:00,393
Damned if I know.

788
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:07,568
<i>Hello. Hello. </i>

789
01:04:07,694 --> 01:04:09,821
Jesus...

790
01:04:13,743 --> 01:04:15,995
Wow.

791
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,332
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?

792
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:23,170
We gotta get
all that stuff up.

793
01:04:28,259 --> 01:04:30,386
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

794
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:32,388
I bet you we can score up here.

795
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:35,350
Check out the bikes, Lance.

796
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:38,395
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

797
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,775
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

798
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,152
Yeah, man.
This is something.

799
01:04:47,198 --> 01:04:49,116
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

800
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:51,577
Right over there.

801
01:04:51,703 --> 01:04:54,039
Sergeant. Sergeant.

802
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,465
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five...

803
01:05:02,591 --> 01:05:04,384
Come on, man! Move!

804
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,637
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?

805
01:05:06,762 --> 01:05:10,057
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

806
01:05:10,183 --> 01:05:13,520
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

807
01:05:13,645 --> 01:05:15,021
I don't have no destination.

808
01:05:15,147 --> 01:05:17,358
I can't do a goddam thing
without a destination.

809
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:20,945
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!

810
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,073
I can't do a thing about it
with a destination.

811
01:05:23,198 --> 01:05:25,951
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

812
01:05:26,076 --> 01:05:28,411
I carry priority papers
from Com-Sec Intelligence.

813
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:32,166
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

814
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:35,336
Eight bucks for that...
Hey!

815
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:37,714
All right. Damn.

816
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,301
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

817
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:44,389
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

818
01:05:44,514 --> 01:05:47,559
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

819
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:52,356
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

820
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:55,652
Would you guys like some seats...
some press box seats for the show?

821
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:58,238
The show out here.

822
01:05:58,364 --> 01:06:00,783
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

823
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:02,743
You got it.
You gonna be here?

824
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:06,081
Hey, listen, Captain,
on the house.

825
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:10,085
No hard feelings, huh?

826
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,337
<i>How ya doin' out there? </i>

827
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:50,257
<i>I said, how ya doin' out there? </i>

828
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,676
<i>Wanna say hello to you
from all of us up here... </i>

829
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:54,679
<i>to all of you
out there who work... </i>

830
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:57,974
<i>so goddam hard
in Operation Brute Force! </i>

831
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,312
<i>Hello, all you
paratroopers out there! </i>

832
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:04,899
<i>And the marines!
And the sailors! </i>

833
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,944
<i>We wanna let you know
that we're proud of you! </i>

834
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:10,656
<i>We know how tough
and how hard it's been. </i>

835
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:13,827
<i>To prove it we're gonna give you
entertainment you're gonna like. </i>

836
01:07:13,952 --> 01:07:18,081
<i>Miss August,
Miss Sandra Beatty. </i>

837
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:24,171
<i>Miss May,
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah! </i>

838
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:30,137
<i>And the playmate of the year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah! </i>

839
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:32,431
Yo! Whoa!

840
01:07:32,557 --> 01:07:35,518
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

841
01:07:35,644 --> 01:07:38,522
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

842
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:43,318
<i>- Oh, Susie-Q baby, I love you
- Hello!</i>

843
01:07:43,445 --> 01:07:45,989
<i>Susie-Q</i>

844
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:50,536
<i>I like the way you walk</i>

845
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:52,746
<i>I like the way you talk</i>

846
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:56,126
<i>I like the way you walk</i>

847
01:07:56,251 --> 01:08:00,130
<i>I like the way you talk
Susie-Q</i>

848
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:05,052
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

849
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:07,264
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i>

850
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:12,936
<i>Oh, Susie-Q
Baby, I love you</i>

851
01:08:13,062 --> 01:08:14,981

852
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:18,109
<i>I love you! </i>

853
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:23,783
- Come on!
- What's the matter?

854
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:25,827
Come on, baby!

855
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:34,378
Grease my gun!

856
01:08:41,763 --> 01:08:44,140
I'm ready to powwow, baby!

857
01:08:58,907 --> 01:09:00,951
Come on! All right!

858
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,287
You're cute. I like you.

859
01:09:03,412 --> 01:09:06,541
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

860
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:13,423
Yeah!

861
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,844
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

862
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:17,595
Take it off!

863
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:21,350
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!

864
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:25,437
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

865
01:09:27,816 --> 01:09:29,693
Sign my centerfold!

866
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,488
Come on, baby!

867
01:09:32,613 --> 01:09:34,907
Goddam!

868
01:09:45,253 --> 01:09:47,964
Start her up. Hey!

869
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,052
Get out of my way!

870
01:09:52,178 --> 01:09:53,804
Come on!

871
01:09:56,975 --> 01:10:00,604
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!

872
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:09,448
Hurry!

873
01:10:19,585 --> 01:10:21,504
So long!

874
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:06,389
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO. </i>

875
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:12,104
<i>He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast. </i>

876
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:20,155
<i>His idea of great R and R was
cold rice and a little rat meat. </i>

877
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,326
<i>He had only two ways home... </i>

878
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,872
<i>death or victory. </i>

879
01:11:38,844 --> 01:11:41,972
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass. </i>

880
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:46,811
<i>The war was being run by
a bunch of four-star clowns... </i>

881
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:51,149
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away. </i>

882
01:11:51,275 --> 01:11:54,153
Hey, you know, man,
that was far-fucking-out.

883
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:57,823
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

884
01:11:57,949 --> 01:12:00,869
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

885
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:03,830
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

886
01:12:03,956 --> 01:12:05,917
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man...

887
01:12:06,042 --> 01:12:07,919
just like that cat in the delta.

888
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:10,130
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

889
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:13,217
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.

890
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:17,846
<i>Remember? This cat, man...
He really dug his Playboy,  man.</i>

891
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,140
Dig it.

892
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:22,352
When the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

893
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:26,023
Look at these beautiful
fuckin' jugs, man!

894
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:29,027
Yeah, so anyway,
he was workin' ARVN patrols.

895
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:32,614
One of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit...

896
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:35,868
One day the gook took his magazine
and wouldn't give it back.

897
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:38,579
He said, "Give me
my magazine back."

898
01:12:38,705 --> 01:12:42,376
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."

899
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,628
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!

900
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:48,675
- Then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef. Take the wheel.

901
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,887
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's tits.

902
01:12:53,013 --> 01:12:54,431
Take the wheel.

903
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:58,894
He started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold.

904
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,982
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

905
01:13:02,108 --> 01:13:04,068
You leave your shitty little

Don't do her like that."

907
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:10,950
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

908
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:14,329
The sergeant couldn't
handle it no more.

909
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:16,708
He just picked up his iron...

910
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:19,210
flipped it to
rock and roll and...

911
01:13:19,335 --> 01:13:21,379
Boom!

912
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:24,216

straight through the Playboy mag.</i>

913
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:27,261
It blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

914
01:13:27,387 --> 01:13:32,642
There wasn't no more lieutenant
that day. That was it for his ass.

915
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:36,647
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

916
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:38,774
They stuck his ass
in the LBJ.

917
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:42,571
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothin'.

918
01:13:44,949 --> 01:13:46,993
Fuckin' ARVN, man.

919
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:48,995
They should have killed the fuck.

920
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,291
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

ain't it?

Seven months.

- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.

1010

My orders say I'm not supposed to
know where I'm taking this boat...

1011
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:48,580
so I don't!

1012

it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

1015

We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,

You just get me close

1054
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:17,657
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:17,783 --> 01:23:20,869
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.

1056
01:23:20,994 --> 01:23:24,790
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?

1057
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,419
We want to send
some people downriver.

1058
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,881
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

1059
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,551
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1060
01:23:40,935 --> 01:23:42,812
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

1061
01:23:42,937 --> 01:23:44,814
Why don't you see what
you can do with that engine?

1062
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:46,857
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.

1063
01:23:46,984 --> 01:23:50,362
Hey, don't leave without me.

1064
01:24:11,137 --> 01:24:13,806
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1065
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:15,933
Don't ask me, man.

1066
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,085
Give my clothes back,
you asshole!

1067
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,468
Asshole!

1068
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:51,725
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1069
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,897
He stepped on a land mine about two
months ago. He got blown to hell.

1070
01:24:57,023 --> 01:24:59,943
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?

1071
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:02,154
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1072
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:05,699
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.

1073
01:25:05,825 --> 01:25:08,411
What about you, fella?

1074
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,040
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

1075
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,919
- Keep it in that condition...
- Get off my back!

1076
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:17,088
- No, man, I'm telling you...
- Lay off!

1077
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:22,052
Hey! Hey! Come here!

1078
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:24,805
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1079
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:27,475
What do you want?

1080
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,812
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!

1081
01:25:33,357 --> 01:25:35,442
Get out of the rain.

1082
01:25:35,568 --> 01:25:37,904
Get off me!

1083
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:40,240
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.

1084
01:25:40,365 --> 01:25:44,953
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1085
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:48,791
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.

1086
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,962
Chef, your ass is shit!

1087
01:25:57,593 --> 01:26:01,139
You're a motherfucker, man.

1088
01:26:01,265 --> 01:26:03,892
Goddam, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1089
01:26:06,271 --> 01:26:09,858
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.

1090
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:12,110
Hey, guys.

1091
01:26:12,236 --> 01:26:14,989
I got you!
I got your ass!

1092
01:26:15,114 --> 01:26:18,534
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

1093
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:22,664
- You pulled my fuckin'...
- Hey, guys.

1094
01:26:22,789 --> 01:26:26,293
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1095
01:26:26,419 --> 01:26:31,174
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1096
01:26:36,848 --> 01:26:39,351
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!

1097
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:42,354
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?

1098
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,025
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of
barrels and get up to that big tent.

1099
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,194
Come on!

1100
01:26:49,321 --> 01:26:51,323
Captain.

1101
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:54,826
You're giving away our fuel
for a playmate of the month?

1102
01:26:54,952 --> 01:26:59,040
Nope, playmate
of the year, Chief.

1103
01:26:59,165 --> 01:27:02,794
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!

1104
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,589
Captain, we get in a fire fight
and run out of fuel...

1105
01:27:05,714 --> 01:27:08,217
I want you to tell me
how she was.

1106
01:27:08,343 --> 01:27:13,348
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1107
01:27:15,977 --> 01:27:19,355
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1108
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:25,112
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1109
01:27:25,238 --> 01:27:28,825
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.

1110
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:49,932
You know, I got a...

1111
01:27:50,058 --> 01:27:52,144
I got every one
of your pictures.

1112
01:27:52,269 --> 01:27:55,105
I got the centerfold,
the playmate's review...

1113
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,899
the playmate of the year run-off.

1114
01:27:58,026 --> 01:27:59,944
I even got the calendar.

1115
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:05,325
<i>Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?</i>

1116
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:08,329
I used to be the bird girl
at Busch Gardens.

1117
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:12,542
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.

1118
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:14,544
You are...

1119
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,757
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1120
01:28:17,882 --> 01:28:19,842
Is it coming?

1121
01:28:26,392 --> 01:28:30,146
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1122
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:33,983
He's not one
of my regular birds.

1123
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:37,988
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1124
01:28:38,114 --> 01:28:41,451
Being playmate of the year...

1125
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:45,080
is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.

1126
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:49,794
It's like...
You try to express...

1127
01:28:49,919 --> 01:28:54,715
your feelings to someone
and show them your heart...

1128
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:56,718
Yeah, I want to hear
about your bird act.

1129
01:28:56,844 --> 01:28:58,721
I'd love to hear
about your bird act.

1130
01:28:58,846 --> 01:29:02,725
But would you mind
just puttin' this...

1131
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:07,523
Would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1132
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:10,359
And there's
this glass wall between you...

1133
01:29:10,485 --> 01:29:13,113
this invisible glass.

1134
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:15,865
They can see
your mouth moving.

1135
01:29:15,992 --> 01:29:18,411
I used to train birds
for at least two years...

1136
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:20,454
- That's beautiful.
- At Busch Gardens.

1137
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,834
This was cascading over your
right shoulder. This was open here.

1138
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:27,546
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1139
01:29:27,672 --> 01:29:31,592
I used to train them to stand
on their head and ride a bicycle...

1140
01:29:31,718 --> 01:29:33,594
Your right hand was...

1141
01:29:33,721 --> 01:29:35,597
Hey, Chef!

1142
01:29:35,723 --> 01:29:38,726
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!

1143
01:29:38,852 --> 01:29:41,730
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.

1144
01:29:41,855 --> 01:29:45,900
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1145
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:49,071
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.

1146
01:29:49,196 --> 01:29:51,615
Your ass was sticking out
just a little... Hey, man, fuck off!

1147
01:29:51,742 --> 01:29:53,702
Fifteen minutes!

1148
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:57,664
That's why I tried
so desperately...

1149
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:01,252
to show somebody
that I had some talent.

1150
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:03,296
Little baby macaws.

1151
01:30:03,422 --> 01:30:06,258
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.

1152
01:30:06,383 --> 01:30:08,594
- They're all blue...
- Take off, would you?

1153
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:11,889
I got my rights, man!

1154
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:14,726
They make you do things
you don't wanna do...

1155
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:18,355
like, this picture here.

1156
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:25,489
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1157
01:30:25,614 --> 01:30:29,201
You were just kind of bending
forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.

1158
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:31,954
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1159
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,458
That's it. That's very...
That's it. Voila.

1160
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:39,630
You're beautiful.
I just want to...

1161
01:30:39,756 --> 01:30:42,634
You know, I can't believe it.

1162
01:30:42,759 --> 01:30:46,971
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.

1163
01:30:47,098 --> 01:30:51,686
Maybe I'm unfit
to have a relationship...

1164
01:30:51,812 --> 01:30:56,650
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1165
01:30:56,775 --> 01:31:00,278
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War...

1166
01:31:00,405 --> 01:31:02,657
I never would have met you,
Miss December.

1167
01:31:02,782 --> 01:31:04,325
Miss May.

1168
01:31:04,451 --> 01:31:09,206
I wish...
I wish I could find...

1169
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:12,167
just one person...

1170
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:16,673
that could share
my point of view.

1171
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:25,267
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1172
01:31:25,392 --> 01:31:27,602
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!

1173
01:31:28,604 --> 01:31:29,981
Who is that?

1174
01:31:30,106 --> 01:31:35,737
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!

1175
01:31:39,783 --> 01:31:43,454
You finished yet?

1176
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,374
Oh! Fuck!

1177
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,919
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!

1178
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:52,214
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!

1179
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:55,010
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1180
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:57,971
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1181
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,224
It drives me crazy!

1182
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:13,155
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1183
01:32:15,742 --> 01:32:20,038
Lance, there were things
that they made me do...

1184
01:32:20,164 --> 01:32:22,249
that I didn't want to do.

1185
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:26,087
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs."

1186
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:28,590
I didn't want to do it.

1187
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:32,427
But they said that was
what was expected of me...

1188
01:32:32,553 --> 01:32:35,306
that that's what people
wanted to see.

1189
01:32:56,998 --> 01:33:00,961
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.

1190
01:33:01,087 --> 01:33:03,715
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.

1191
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,509
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuckup.

1192
01:33:06,635 --> 01:33:09,471
Sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd take you to New Orleans.

1193
01:33:09,596 --> 01:33:11,974
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to...

1194
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,603
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.

1195
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:17,981
You're a fuckin' dog!

1196
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:21,318
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.

1197
01:33:21,444 --> 01:33:23,320
Lay off, Chef.

1198
01:33:23,447 --> 01:33:25,323
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.

1199
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:27,325
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.

1200
01:33:27,451 --> 01:33:28,326
Lay off!

1201
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:30,996
What are you gonna
do with it, cherry boy?

1202
01:33:31,122 --> 01:33:32,498
Chef, I said lay off!

1203
01:33:32,623 --> 01:33:37,003
Chef, knock it off! Give him
a break! What do you think I said?

1204
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:39,048
Then give your jaws a rest!

1205
01:33:39,173 --> 01:33:43,177
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!

1206
01:33:43,303 --> 01:33:45,513
So get out of that
frizzly army-looking shirt...

1207
01:33:45,638 --> 01:33:47,557
and stop smoking that dope!

1208
01:33:47,682 --> 01:33:49,601
You hear me?

1209
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:56,067
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1210
01:33:56,193 --> 01:33:58,528
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1211
01:33:58,653 --> 01:34:00,697
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1212
01:34:00,823 --> 01:34:04,243
I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1213
01:34:21,472 --> 01:34:25,351
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1214
01:34:25,477 --> 01:34:27,896
Let's take a look. Lance.

1215
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:32,484
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.

1216
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:35,279
Clean, get on that 60!

1217
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:38,909
What's up, Chief?

1218
01:34:40,369 --> 01:34:42,746
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1219
01:34:42,872 --> 01:34:46,251
Well, let's forget routine now
and let 'em go.

1220
01:34:46,376 --> 01:34:49,254
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1221
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:51,799
I'm gonna take a look.

1222
01:34:51,924 --> 01:34:53,843
My mission's got priority.

1223
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:56,804
You wouldn't even be in this part
of the river if it wasn't for me.

1224
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:00,434
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1225
01:35:00,559 --> 01:35:04,271
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

1226
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:07,316
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1227
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:23,878
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1228
01:35:29,718 --> 01:35:33,055
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!

1229
01:35:34,724 --> 01:35:35,933
<i>Can couc,  you too.</i>

1230
01:35:36,059 --> 01:35:38,352
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.

1231
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,985
It's clear, Chief.

1232
01:35:49,742 --> 01:35:53,871
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1233
01:35:53,996 --> 01:35:56,665
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.

1234
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,668
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.

1235
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:02,005
Just some baskets and
some ducks, fuckin' bananas.

1236
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,966
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?

1237
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:07,887
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.

1238
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,890
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables...

1239
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,892
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!

1240
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:13,519
- Get on it!
- All right!

1241
01:36:13,645 --> 01:36:16,940
Move it, asshole!
Goddam it!

1242
01:36:17,023 --> 01:36:19,275
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!

1243
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:21,903
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1244
01:36:21,987 --> 01:36:24,407
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!

1245
01:36:24,532 --> 01:36:29,578
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.

1246
01:36:29,704 --> 01:36:31,915
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!

1247
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:33,918
Come on!

1248
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:36,045
Check that vegetable basket!

1249
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:38,047
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1250
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:41,218
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1251
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:43,095
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!

1252
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,014
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!

1253
01:36:46,141 --> 01:36:49,310
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1254
01:36:52,648 --> 01:36:55,067
Chef!

1255
01:36:58,071 --> 01:37:01,324
Motherfuckers!

1256
01:37:03,661 --> 01:37:06,414
Motherfuckers!

1257
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:11,795
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.

1258
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,257
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1259
01:37:15,383 --> 01:37:17,510
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.

1260
01:37:17,635 --> 01:37:20,889
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1261
01:37:21,015 --> 01:37:24,769
Why the fuck not?

1262
01:37:24,894 --> 01:37:28,147
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1263
01:37:34,906 --> 01:37:36,991
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1264
01:37:37,116 --> 01:37:39,786
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!

1265
01:37:39,912 --> 01:37:43,040
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?

1266
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,629
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1267
01:37:47,754 --> 01:37:50,632
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1268
01:37:50,757 --> 01:37:53,009
Give me that dog!

1269
01:37:53,135 --> 01:37:55,054
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

1270
01:37:55,179 --> 01:37:58,432
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!

1271
01:37:58,558 --> 01:38:01,645
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!

1272
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,063
- Chef...
- You want that?

1273
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:06,901
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1274
01:38:06,984 --> 01:38:09,695
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1275
01:38:09,822 --> 01:38:13,325
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddam it!

1276
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:16,620
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.

1277
01:38:16,746 --> 01:38:18,706
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!

1278
01:38:18,832 --> 01:38:22,127
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.

1279
01:38:22,253 --> 01:38:24,130
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?

1280
01:38:24,255 --> 01:38:28,342
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.

1281
01:38:28,468 --> 01:38:30,846
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1282
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,807
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.

1283
01:38:33,933 --> 01:38:36,853
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.

1284
01:38:36,978 --> 01:38:38,187
The book says...

1285
01:38:49,033 --> 01:38:52,287
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1286
01:38:52,413 --> 01:38:54,331
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1287
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,988
<i>It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves. </i>

1288
01:39:57,156 --> 01:40:00,618
<i>We'd cut 'em in half with a
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid. </i>

1289
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:05,082
<i>It was a lie. </i>

1290
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:07,794
<i>And the more I saw of them... </i>

1291
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:10,171
<i>the more I hated lies. </i>

1292
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:15,719
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again... </i>

1293
01:40:16,805 --> 01:40:21,393
<i>but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier. </i>

1294
01:40:26,774 --> 01:40:30,820
<i>Do Lung Bridge was the last
army outpost on the Nung River. </i>

1295
01:40:35,243 --> 01:40:37,537
<i>Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz. </i>

1296
01:40:42,293 --> 01:40:44,670
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

1297
01:40:46,046 --> 01:40:48,090
Huh? What's the matter with you?

1298
01:40:48,216 --> 01:40:50,677
You're acting kind of weird.

1299
01:40:50,802 --> 01:40:54,014
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1300
01:40:55,141 --> 01:40:58,144
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?

1301
01:40:58,144 --> 01:40:59,562
Far out.

1302
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:04,943
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!

1303
01:41:10,575 --> 01:41:11,868
Take me home!

1304
01:41:11,994 --> 01:41:13,871
Goddam it!

1305
01:41:13,996 --> 01:41:17,082
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?

1306
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:19,126
Don't keep goin'!

1307
01:41:21,505 --> 01:41:23,715
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!

1308
01:41:23,841 --> 01:41:25,927
Fuck you!

1309
01:41:26,052 --> 01:41:28,137
You'll get what you deserve!

1310
01:41:36,231 --> 01:41:38,316
Is there a Captain Willard
on board?

1311
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:40,360
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?

1312
01:41:40,485 --> 01:41:43,822
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1313
01:41:43,948 --> 01:41:46,617
Get that light off me!

1314
01:41:46,742 --> 01:41:49,703
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1315
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:53,250
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1316
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:55,752
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?

1317
01:41:55,878 --> 01:41:58,506
Now I can get out of here,
if I can find a way.

1318
01:42:02,302 --> 01:42:05,722
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain.

1319
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:11,855
Captain, where you going?

1320
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:15,733
See if I can find some fuel
and get some information.

1321
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,945
Pick me up at the other side
of the bridge.

1322
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:20,114
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1323
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,075
I'll go.

1324
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,785
I wanna go.

1325
01:43:16,305 --> 01:43:18,766
Man, listen
to the music, man.

1326
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:20,768
Where can I find the CO?

1327
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:22,771
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1328
01:43:25,107 --> 01:43:27,527
Get down here!

1329
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:31,948
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1330
01:43:32,074 --> 01:43:34,701
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1331
01:43:34,827 --> 01:43:39,373
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!

1332
01:43:39,499 --> 01:43:42,669
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1333
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:20,379
- Goddam it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.

1334
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:22,716
Well, you thought wrong,
damn it!

1335
01:44:26,095 --> 01:44:28,264
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1336
01:44:28,389 --> 01:44:30,016
You think you're so bad,
huh, nigger?

1337
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:32,143
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1338
01:44:32,269 --> 01:44:34,313
What the fuck
ya think I'm shootin' at?

1339
01:44:34,438 --> 01:44:37,191
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks
out there by the wire.

1340
01:44:37,316 --> 01:44:38,984
But I think I killed them all.

1341
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:41,196
You ain't shot shit. Listen.

1342
01:44:42,864 --> 01:44:45,867
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends. Send up a flare.

1343
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:56,588
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?

1344
01:44:56,714 --> 01:44:58,090
They're all dead, stupid.

1345
01:44:58,216 --> 01:45:01,260
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1346
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:02,887
Who's the commanding
officer here?

1347
01:45:04,056 --> 01:45:05,974
Ain't you?

1348
01:45:07,684 --> 01:45:09,228
You think you so bad?

1349
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:13,817
I got something for your ass now,
nigger! I got something for you now!

1350
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:17,655
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1351
01:45:19,031 --> 01:45:21,200
Go get the Roach for me.

1352
01:45:21,326 --> 01:45:24,913
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.

1353
01:45:29,335 --> 01:45:31,671
Roach. Roach.

1354
01:45:34,299 --> 01:45:36,260
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?

1355
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:38,762
Do you hear 'em?

1356
01:45:41,057 --> 01:45:43,685
Fuck you, GI!

1357
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:45,353
We'll bust 'em!

1358
01:45:48,107 --> 01:45:50,776
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1359
01:45:54,865 --> 01:45:56,616
Fuck you, GI!

1360
01:45:57,702 --> 01:46:00,246
Fuck you, GI!

1361
01:46:00,371 --> 01:46:02,540
Hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1362
01:46:05,169 --> 01:46:07,963
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?

1363
01:46:12,844 --> 01:46:16,723
He's close, man.
He's real close.

1364
01:46:24,316 --> 01:46:27,819
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!

1365
01:46:32,283 --> 01:46:34,160
Fuck you, GI!

1366
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:41,001
GI, fuck you!

1367
01:46:43,213 --> 01:46:45,882
GI! GI...

1368
01:46:51,555 --> 01:46:52,848
Motherfucker.

1369
01:46:53,975 --> 01:46:55,519
Hey, soldier.

1370
01:46:59,982 --> 01:47:01,859
Do you know who's
in command here?

1371
01:47:20,047 --> 01:47:22,550
Holy shit.

1372
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,141
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1373
01:47:30,268 --> 01:47:33,062
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1374
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:38,944
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.

1375
01:47:39,069 --> 01:47:41,572
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.

1376
01:47:43,825 --> 01:47:46,578
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1377
01:47:46,704 --> 01:47:48,330
Let's move out.

1378
01:47:48,455 --> 01:47:52,209
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1379
01:47:54,296 --> 01:47:56,548
Let's just get goin'.

1380
01:47:56,631 --> 01:47:58,550
Which way, Captain?

1381
01:48:04,223 --> 01:48:06,976
You know which way, Chief.

1382
01:48:07,102 --> 01:48:09,813
You're on your own, Captain.

1383
01:48:09,938 --> 01:48:11,315
Still wanna go on?

1384
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:13,026
It's like this bridge.

1385
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:16,237
We build it every night, Charlie
blows it right back up again...

1386
01:48:16,362 --> 01:48:18,865
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1387
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:20,701
Think about it.

1388
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,958
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1389
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,508
Chef, on the bow.

1390
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:36,886
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1391
01:49:28,905 --> 01:49:33,201
You got one, Miller.
Jeez, I got some too.

1392
01:49:33,327 --> 01:49:34,871
Whose package is that?

1393
01:49:34,996 --> 01:49:38,291
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.

1394
01:49:38,417 --> 01:49:41,044
- Is that it?
- That's it for you. Lance.

1395
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,633
Mr. L.B. Johnson,
there you go.

1396
01:49:45,758 --> 01:49:49,220
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.

1397
01:49:49,346 --> 01:49:52,641
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1398
01:49:52,766 --> 01:49:55,144
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1399
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:58,815
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1400
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:01,318
Man, I wanna get back
to Antoine's.

1401
01:50:01,444 --> 01:50:05,698
"I remember the time we went up to..."
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.

1402
01:50:05,823 --> 01:50:08,576
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1403
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:09,828
Let me know."

1404
01:50:09,953 --> 01:50:13,290
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.

1405
01:50:17,837 --> 01:50:20,381
<i>"There has been a new development
regarding your mission... </i>

1406
01:50:20,507 --> 01:50:22,843
<i>which we must now
communicate to you. </i>

1407
01:50:22,968 --> 01:50:26,388
<i>Months ago, a man was ordered on
a mission which was identical to yours. </i>

1408
01:50:27,265 --> 01:50:30,936
<i>We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Col. Kurtz. </i>

1409
01:50:32,647 --> 01:50:36,108
<i>Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake... </i>

1410
01:50:36,234 --> 01:50:38,653
<i>but they assumed he was dead. </i>

1411
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:42,783
<i>Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife. "</i>

1412
01:50:46,204 --> 01:50:48,122
<i>Captain Richard Colby. </i>

1413
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:52,711
<i>He was with Kurtz. </i>

1414
01:50:52,836 --> 01:50:55,297
Disneyland.

1415
01:50:55,423 --> 01:50:57,968
Fuck, man, this is better
than Disneyland.

1416
01:50:58,093 --> 01:51:02,514
"Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home...

1417
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,642
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1418
01:51:04,767 --> 01:51:07,186
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1419
01:51:07,312 --> 01:51:10,524
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1420
01:51:10,649 --> 01:51:13,902
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.

1421
01:51:14,028 --> 01:51:17,365
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1422
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:20,243
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.

1423
01:51:20,369 --> 01:51:23,706
She pictures me at home
having a beer watching TV.

1424
01:51:25,166 --> 01:51:26,418
Hey, Lance, man.

1425
01:51:26,543 --> 01:51:28,879
Oh, hot potato,
hot potato.

1426
01:51:29,004 --> 01:51:31,840
<i>I'm so glad you decided
to join the navy. </i>

1427
01:51:31,966 --> 01:51:35,261
Eva's not sure she can have
a relationship with me, you know.

1428
01:51:35,386 --> 01:51:38,097
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away...

1429
01:51:38,223 --> 01:51:41,310
trying to keep a relationship
with my ass.

1430
01:51:41,435 --> 01:51:45,147
<i>That's much more than I can say
for some of your friends. </i>

1431
01:51:45,273 --> 01:51:47,275
<i>If this tape is any good... </i>

1432
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:51,529
<i>I will have Dad and the family
send you a tape of their own. </i>

1433
01:52:03,961 --> 01:52:05,338
Fuckers!

1434
01:52:10,761 --> 01:52:12,888
There! Over there!

1435
01:52:14,766 --> 01:52:16,643
Motherfuckers!

1436
01:52:27,364 --> 01:52:29,241
There. Over there!

1437
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:42,548
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.

1438
01:52:42,673 --> 01:52:44,967
Where'd the dog go?

1439
01:52:45,093 --> 01:52:48,179
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.

1440
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:51,891
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.

1441
01:52:52,017 --> 01:52:55,187
Hey, Clean. Hey.

1442
01:52:55,312 --> 01:52:57,648
Hey, bubba.

1443
01:52:57,774 --> 01:52:59,776
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1444
01:53:01,653 --> 01:53:03,196
Hey, bubba.

1445
01:53:03,322 --> 01:53:08,619
<i>And so I'm hoping that...
pretty soon... not too soon... </i>

1446
01:53:08,745 --> 01:53:13,166
<i>but pretty soon I'll have a lot
of grandchildren to love and spoil. </i>

1447
01:53:13,292 --> 01:53:16,962
<i>And then when your wife get 'em back,
she'll be mad with me. </i>

1448
01:53:19,173 --> 01:53:21,509
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama... </i>

1449
01:53:21,635 --> 01:53:24,889
<i>will come to celebrate
your coming home. </i>

1450
01:53:25,014 --> 01:53:28,559
<i>Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car... </i>

1451
01:53:28,685 --> 01:53:33,231
<i>but don't tell 'em
because that's our secret. </i>

1452
01:53:33,357 --> 01:53:36,068
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing... </i>

1453
01:53:36,193 --> 01:53:38,571
<i>stay out of the way
of the bullets... </i>

1454
01:53:38,696 --> 01:53:42,742
<i>and bring your heinie home
all in one piece... </i>

1455
01:53:42,868 --> 01:53:45,120
<i>because we love you
very much. </i>

1456
01:53:45,246 --> 01:53:47,165
<i>Love, Mom. </i>

1457
01:55:21,107 --> 01:55:22,775
Hold on.

1458
01:55:25,154 --> 01:55:27,031
Throw me the glasses.

1459
01:55:39,295 --> 01:55:41,964
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.

1460
01:55:44,676 --> 01:55:48,305
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.

1461
01:56:10,539 --> 01:56:11,582
Fuck me.

1462
01:57:20,622 --> 01:57:23,082
Cover the captain. Lance.

1463
01:57:23,207 --> 01:57:25,084
Cover the captain.

1464
01:57:42,397 --> 01:57:44,024
They're French.
They're French.

1465
01:57:46,485 --> 01:57:49,196
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1466
01:57:49,322 --> 01:57:50,907
Stand fast. Captain.

1467
01:58:25,698 --> 01:58:28,284
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.

1468
01:59:23,222 --> 01:59:25,099
We lost one of our men.

1469
01:59:28,854 --> 01:59:32,942
We French always pay respect
to the dead of our allies.

1470
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:37,739
You're all welcome.

1471
01:59:40,368 --> 01:59:42,370
My name is Hubert DeMarais.

1472
01:59:43,997 --> 01:59:46,833
This is my family's plantation.

1473
01:59:46,959 --> 01:59:50,045
It has been such
for 70 years.

1474
01:59:51,130 --> 01:59:54,467
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1475
02:02:06,037 --> 02:02:09,499
Captain, accept the flag
of Tyrone Miller...

1476
02:02:09,625 --> 02:02:12,128
on behalf of
a grateful nation.

1477
02:02:32,276 --> 02:02:35,112
This food is really wonderful,
isn't it? The wine, the sauces.

1478
02:02:35,238 --> 02:02:38,742
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?

1479
02:02:38,867 --> 02:02:41,077
The chef speak
only Vietnamese.

1480
02:02:41,203 --> 02:02:44,957
No kidding? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1481
02:02:45,082 --> 02:02:48,127
Hey, Lance,
the chef's a slope.

1482
02:03:20,499 --> 02:03:24,127
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.

1483
02:03:24,253 --> 02:03:28,132
But they need it, 'cause
life sometimes is very cruel.

1484
02:03:29,218 --> 02:03:31,136
As you can see.

1485
02:03:34,891 --> 02:03:36,977
Attack repels by the family.

1486
02:03:37,102 --> 02:03:39,104
Just for this war.

1487
02:03:39,229 --> 02:03:43,650
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.

1488
02:03:43,776 --> 02:03:46,904
South Vietnamese, 11.

1489
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:48,949
Americans, six?

1490
02:03:50,283 --> 02:03:53,662
Yes. Well, there were
perhaps mistakes.

1491
02:04:14,562 --> 02:04:17,189
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.

1492
02:04:17,316 --> 02:04:19,484
Madame Sarrault.

1493
02:04:19,609 --> 02:04:20,986
Captain.

1494
02:04:47,684 --> 02:04:49,895
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story...

1495
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:52,356
about Paris and people
starving during the war.

1496
02:04:52,481 --> 02:04:55,192
They are all around the table, and
there was a silence and somebody say...

1497
02:04:55,318 --> 02:04:57,320
"An angel is passing by."

1498
02:04:57,445 --> 02:05:00,698
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1499
02:05:00,824 --> 02:05:02,117
Oh.

1500
02:05:07,749 --> 02:05:11,461
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1501
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:14,215
We stay forever.

1502
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:16,217
No, no. I mean...

1503
02:05:17,468 --> 02:05:19,470
why don't you go
back home to France?

1504
02:05:20,514 --> 02:05:24,434
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1505
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,145
Sooner or later, you're...

1506
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:31,067
You don't understand
our mentality...

1507
02:05:31,193 --> 02:05:33,570
the French officer mentality!

1508
02:05:33,696 --> 02:05:35,906
At first, we lose
in Second World War.

1509
02:05:36,032 --> 02:05:39,077
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1510
02:05:39,202 --> 02:05:40,203
Oh, Papa...

1511
02:05:41,329 --> 02:05:44,124
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.

1512
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:46,627
In Indochina, we lose!

1513
02:05:46,752 --> 02:05:49,463
But here we don't lose!

1514
02:05:49,589 --> 02:05:52,592
This piece of earth,
we keep it.

1515
02:05:52,718 --> 02:05:54,594
We will never lose it.
Never!

1516
02:06:00,394 --> 02:06:02,229
You Americans.

1517
02:06:03,689 --> 02:06:08,110
In 1945, yeah...

1518
02:06:08,236 --> 02:06:12,741
after the Japanese war,
your President Roosevelt...

1519
02:06:12,867 --> 02:06:16,078
didn't want the French people
to stay in Indochina.

1520
02:06:17,747 --> 02:06:19,707
So...

1521
02:06:19,791 --> 02:06:22,753
you Americans implant
the Vietminh.

1522
02:06:24,464 --> 02:06:25,715
What's he mean?

1523
02:06:25,798 --> 02:06:29,218
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong
were invented by the Americans.

1524
02:06:30,386 --> 02:06:31,596
The Americans?

1525
02:06:32,473 --> 02:06:34,975
And now you take
the French place...

1526
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:37,227
and the Vietminh fight you.

1527
02:06:37,354 --> 02:06:39,230
And what can you do?

1528
02:06:39,356 --> 02:06:41,649
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1529
02:06:41,775 --> 02:06:45,320
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1530
02:06:45,446 --> 02:06:49,158
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.

1531
02:06:49,284 --> 02:06:53,121
We are all Communists. Chinese,
give us guns. We are all brothers."

1532
02:06:53,246 --> 02:06:55,165
They hate the Chinese!

1533
02:06:55,291 --> 02:07:00,129
Maybe they hate the American
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1534
02:07:00,254 --> 02:07:02,465
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are Communists...

1535
02:07:02,591 --> 02:07:04,468
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1536
02:07:04,593 --> 02:07:07,179
And this is something that you
never understood, you American.

1537
02:07:07,305 --> 02:07:09,182
I don't know.

1538
02:07:09,307 --> 02:07:12,769
Maybe in the future we can make
something with the Vietminh.

1539
02:07:12,894 --> 02:07:15,021
Don't you understand?

1540
02:07:15,147 --> 02:07:17,900
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."

1541
02:07:18,025 --> 02:07:20,528
That's finish for all
the white people in Indochina.

1542
02:07:20,654 --> 02:07:23,907
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1543
02:07:24,032 --> 02:07:27,619
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.

1544
02:07:29,997 --> 02:07:33,042
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.

1545
02:07:35,504 --> 02:07:36,714
The white left...

1546
02:07:38,508 --> 02:07:41,594
but the yellow stays!

1547
02:07:48,769 --> 02:07:52,606
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.

1548
02:07:52,733 --> 02:07:55,736
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.

1549
02:07:55,862 --> 02:07:58,990
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.

1550
02:07:59,115 --> 02:08:01,701
Tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines...

1551
02:08:01,827 --> 02:08:04,455
then maybe Europe."

1552
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:07,624
Come on. Why not Europe?

1553
02:08:07,751 --> 02:08:10,045
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently.

1554
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:13,757
Even before Second World War Americans
knew exactly what was going on.

1555
02:08:13,883 --> 02:08:17,511
They don't want
that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1556
02:08:19,138 --> 02:08:21,265
All you white people are shit.

1557
02:08:21,391 --> 02:08:23,852
They are fighting...
fighting for freedom.

1558
02:08:23,977 --> 02:08:26,229
Freedom? Bullshit.

1559
02:08:26,356 --> 02:08:29,150
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1560
02:08:29,275 --> 02:08:31,611
Dien Bien Phu,
that serious.

1561
02:08:31,736 --> 02:08:35,615
All soldiers know
they are already dead.

1562
02:08:36,825 --> 02:08:38,911
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1563
02:08:42,082 --> 02:08:44,000
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1564
02:08:45,252 --> 02:08:47,963
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.

1565
02:08:48,089 --> 02:08:49,340
A military mistake.

1566
02:08:49,465 --> 02:08:51,801
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!

1567
02:08:51,927 --> 02:08:53,553
Voluntary!

1568
02:08:55,639 --> 02:08:59,518
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1569
02:08:59,644 --> 02:09:02,772
The generals and the colonels believe
it's impossible for the Viets...

1570
02:09:02,898 --> 02:09:05,567
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains.

1571
02:09:05,693 --> 02:09:09,905
But they do. Then they wait
for the rain to come.

1572
02:09:11,449 --> 02:09:16,121
When it comes,
no aeroplane can fly there.

1573
02:09:16,247 --> 02:09:18,541
And our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters.

1574
02:09:18,666 --> 02:09:21,752
I mean, you know,
90 meters... 70 meters.

1575
02:09:21,878 --> 02:09:24,506
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1576
02:09:24,631 --> 02:09:28,343
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1577
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:37,271
The French Army was sacrificed.

1578
02:09:37,396 --> 02:09:39,857
Sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home.

1579
02:09:39,983 --> 02:09:42,777
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1580
02:09:42,902 --> 02:09:45,613
The students are
marching in Paris...

1581
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:47,616
protesting, demonstrating.

1582
02:09:47,742 --> 02:09:49,994
They stab the soldiers
in their back.

1583
02:09:50,119 --> 02:09:53,831
The soldier would open
the grenade, it wouldn't work.

1584
02:09:53,957 --> 02:09:58,045
A piece of paper would fall...

1585
02:09:58,171 --> 02:10:01,340
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."

1586
02:10:01,466 --> 02:10:05,136
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.

1587
02:10:07,014 --> 02:10:09,558
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1588
02:10:09,684 --> 02:10:13,563
The French is shit, huh?

1589
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:15,940
No one care.
No one want...

1590
02:10:18,569 --> 02:10:21,781
Why don't you Americans
learn from us, from our mistakes?

1591
02:10:21,865 --> 02:10:23,784
<i>Mon Dieux,  with your army,
your strength...</i>

1592
02:10:23,867 --> 02:10:26,161
your power, you could win
if you want to!

1593
02:10:28,581 --> 02:10:30,833
You can win.

1594
02:10:34,213 --> 02:10:37,591
You know, I'm sure
we can make something here.

1595
02:10:37,716 --> 02:10:39,593
I'm sure about it,
you know?

1596
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:43,139
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1597
02:10:43,264 --> 02:10:45,809
That's right, but the Communist
at home have never been traitors.

1598
02:11:11,423 --> 02:11:14,092
- Communist!
- Socialist!

1599
02:11:22,269 --> 02:11:25,689
<i>Capitaine,  good night.
He was a Socialist, you know.</i>

1600
02:11:25,814 --> 02:11:29,943
We can stay. I know
that we can stay. We can.

1601
02:11:33,489 --> 02:11:36,868
You know, we always
helped the people.

1602
02:11:36,994 --> 02:11:38,912
We work with the people.

1603
02:11:39,997 --> 02:11:43,250
So we can be friends,
we are agreed.

1604
02:11:55,307 --> 02:11:59,227
See, Captain,
when my grandfather...

1605
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:03,900
and my uncle's father
came here...

1606
02:12:05,861 --> 02:12:08,489
there was nothing...
nothing.

1607
02:12:09,615 --> 02:12:12,284
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1608
02:12:14,037 --> 02:12:16,372
So we worked hard...

1609
02:12:16,498 --> 02:12:18,416
very hard, and brought...

1610
02:12:18,542 --> 02:12:22,129
the rubber from Brazil,
and then plant it here.

1611
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:26,468
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them...

1612
02:12:27,344 --> 02:12:29,221
make something...

1613
02:12:29,347 --> 02:12:32,058
something out of nothing.

1614
02:12:32,183 --> 02:12:36,604
So when you ask me why
we want to stay here, Captain...

1615
02:12:38,190 --> 02:12:42,277
we want to stay here because
it's ours... it belongs to us.

1616
02:12:42,404 --> 02:12:44,322
It keeps our family together.

1617
02:12:46,199 --> 02:12:48,118
I mean, we fight for that.

1618
02:12:50,204 --> 02:12:54,542
While you Americans,
you are fighting for...

1619
02:12:54,668 --> 02:12:58,630
the biggest nothing in history.

1620
02:13:05,848 --> 02:13:10,686
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see
if your men need any help to...

1621
02:13:10,811 --> 02:13:12,896
repair your boat...

1622
02:13:13,022 --> 02:13:16,025
so that you can go on
with your war.

1623
02:13:51,734 --> 02:13:54,612
I apologize
for my family, Captain.

1624
02:13:56,198 --> 02:13:58,492
We have all lost much here.

1625
02:13:59,743 --> 02:14:02,537
Hubert... his wife
and two sons.

1626
02:14:07,419 --> 02:14:09,630
And I have lost a husband.

1627
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:17,222
I understand.

1628
02:14:17,347 --> 02:14:19,891
You are tired of the war.

1629
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:24,105
I can see it in your face.

1630
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:30,195
'Twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1631
02:14:31,656 --> 02:14:35,368
<i>We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus..."</i>

1632
02:14:35,493 --> 02:14:37,703
The Lost Soldiers.

1633
02:14:42,418 --> 02:14:44,962
If you like,
we can have some cognac.

1634
02:14:52,138 --> 02:14:55,224
I have to...
to see about my men and...

1635
02:15:02,483 --> 02:15:05,361
The war will be
still here tomorrow.

1636
02:15:15,623 --> 02:15:17,834
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1637
02:15:25,886 --> 02:15:28,638
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1638
02:15:29,723 --> 02:15:32,851
No, I don't drink wine.

1639
02:15:35,897 --> 02:15:39,984
I do like cognac, but I don't want
any now. Thank you.

1640
02:15:41,278 --> 02:15:43,697
Well...

1641
02:15:43,823 --> 02:15:46,868
then I...
I must drink alone.

1642
02:15:57,130 --> 02:16:00,342
Will you go back
after the war to America?

1643
02:16:06,015 --> 02:16:09,477
Then you're like us...
your home is here.

1644
02:16:26,915 --> 02:16:30,794
Do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice?

1645
02:16:33,047 --> 02:16:36,592
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1646
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:41,597
I used to prepare
a pipe for my husband.

1647
02:16:48,022 --> 02:16:52,318
'Twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1648
02:16:55,656 --> 02:16:59,827
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1649
02:17:03,499 --> 02:17:07,420
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.

1650
02:17:07,545 --> 02:17:10,173
Don't you see?

1651
02:17:10,299 --> 02:17:14,178
One that kills
and one that loves."

1652
02:17:16,139 --> 02:17:18,308
And he said to me...

1653
02:17:18,433 --> 02:17:23,146
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

1654
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:27,568
But you are both.

1655
02:18:09,576 --> 02:18:11,453
You want more?

1656
02:18:16,876 --> 02:18:20,588
All that matters
is that you're alive.

1657
02:18:22,299 --> 02:18:25,052
You are alive, Captain.

1658
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,892
That's the truth.

1659
02:19:44,019 --> 02:19:46,814
There are two of you,
don't you see?

1660
02:19:48,858 --> 02:19:51,361
One that kills...

1661
02:19:51,486 --> 02:19:53,822
and one that loves.

1662
02:20:22,397 --> 02:20:25,275
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

1663
02:20:25,401 --> 02:20:27,945
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1664
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:31,532
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1665
02:20:31,658 --> 02:20:33,535
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

1666
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:36,371
I'm in command here, goddam it.
You'll do what I say.

1667
02:20:38,166 --> 02:20:40,042
You see anything, Chef?

1668
02:20:42,421 --> 02:20:45,174
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1669
02:21:03,695 --> 02:21:05,822
Watch it over here, Chief.

1670
02:21:06,782 --> 02:21:08,743
Got a stump.

1671
02:21:11,622 --> 02:21:13,332
On the fifties.

1672
02:21:13,457 --> 02:21:15,834
<i>He was close. </i>

1673
02:21:17,294 --> 02:21:19,421
<i>He was real close. </i>

1674
02:21:20,548 --> 02:21:24,010
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him... </i>

1675
02:21:24,136 --> 02:21:26,055
<i>as if the boat were being
sucked upriver... </i>

1676
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,016
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle. </i>

1677
02:21:31,561 --> 02:21:33,438
<i>Whatever was going to happen... </i>

1678
02:21:33,563 --> 02:21:37,442
<i>it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang. </i>

1679
02:21:42,574 --> 02:21:44,952
- Arrows!
- Fire!

1680
02:21:47,287 --> 02:21:50,123
Chef, open up! Fire!

1681
02:21:53,336 --> 02:21:55,630
Lance, fire!

1682
02:22:03,348 --> 02:22:07,310
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1683
02:22:07,436 --> 02:22:11,065
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

1684
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:14,152
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1685
02:22:14,278 --> 02:22:16,822
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1686
02:22:16,947 --> 02:22:18,907
Quiet!

1687
02:22:19,033 --> 02:22:21,911
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

1688
02:22:22,036 --> 02:22:24,497
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

1689
02:22:24,623 --> 02:22:26,750
Do ya?

1690
02:22:26,876 --> 02:22:30,004
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1691
02:22:31,548 --> 02:22:33,800
Lance, get the wheel!

1692
02:22:33,925 --> 02:22:38,180
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

1693
02:22:58,454 --> 02:23:00,039
A spear?

1694
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:22,718
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1695
02:24:22,844 --> 02:24:25,763
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane...

1696
02:24:25,889 --> 02:24:27,307
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1697
02:24:28,767 --> 02:24:31,687
That's fucking typical!
Shit!

1698
02:24:31,812 --> 02:24:34,064
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1699
02:24:34,191 --> 02:24:37,861
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1700
02:24:37,986 --> 02:24:41,656
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1701
02:24:41,782 --> 02:24:45,953
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

1702
02:24:46,038 --> 02:24:48,999
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

1703
02:24:49,124 --> 02:24:52,419
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

1704
02:24:52,545 --> 02:24:54,964
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1705
02:24:55,089 --> 02:24:58,426
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1706
02:24:58,552 --> 02:25:02,973
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

1707
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:11,511
<i>Part of me was afraid
of what I would find... </i>

1708
02:26:11,637 --> 02:26:14,056
<i>and what I would do
when I got there. </i>

1709
02:26:16,018 --> 02:26:18,854
<i>I knew the risks... </i>

1710
02:26:18,979 --> 02:26:21,273
<i>or imagined I knew. </i>

1711
02:26:23,193 --> 02:26:25,737
<i>But the thing
I felt the most... </i>

1712
02:26:25,862 --> 02:26:28,948
<i>much stronger than fear... </i>

1713
02:26:29,074 --> 02:26:31,785
<i>was the desire to confront him. </i>

1714
02:27:43,619 --> 02:27:45,663
Just keep movin'.

1715
02:27:45,788 --> 02:27:49,917
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1716
02:29:16,727 --> 02:29:19,313
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1717
02:29:20,691 --> 02:29:23,735
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1718
02:29:23,861 --> 02:29:28,324
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

1719
02:29:38,545 --> 02:29:40,797
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

1720
02:29:40,922 --> 02:29:44,092
And watch out. Those goddam
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1721
02:29:44,218 --> 02:29:47,430
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

1722
02:29:47,555 --> 02:29:49,265
I'm an American.

1723
02:29:49,391 --> 02:29:52,185
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

1724
02:29:52,311 --> 02:29:54,771
Hi. American.

1725
02:29:54,898 --> 02:29:56,983
American civilian.
It's all right.

1726
02:29:57,108 --> 02:30:00,987
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

1727
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:05,743
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1728
02:30:09,789 --> 02:30:11,416
I'm a photojournalist.

1729
02:30:11,541 --> 02:30:14,210
I've covered the war
since '64.

1730
02:30:14,337 --> 02:30:16,881
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

1731
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:24,348
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1732
02:30:24,474 --> 02:30:26,726
Who are all these people?

1733
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:30,647
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to...

1734
02:30:30,773 --> 02:30:32,066
to take him away.

1735
02:30:32,191 --> 02:30:35,361
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1736
02:30:37,530 --> 02:30:40,825
Him! Col. Kurtz.

1737
02:30:40,951 --> 02:30:44,663
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1738
02:30:44,789 --> 02:30:48,501
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

1739
02:30:48,626 --> 02:30:52,255
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

1740
02:30:52,381 --> 02:30:56,593
Hey, Mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.

1741
02:30:56,719 --> 02:30:58,596
Well, you listen to him.

1742
02:30:58,721 --> 02:31:01,975
The man's enlarged my mind.

1743
02:31:02,101 --> 02:31:05,771
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1744
02:31:05,896 --> 02:31:07,773
I mean, sometimes he'll...

1745
02:31:07,899 --> 02:31:09,484
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

1746
02:31:09,609 --> 02:31:11,987
He'll just walk by you
and he won't even notice you.

1747
02:31:12,112 --> 02:31:15,699
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1748
02:31:15,825 --> 02:31:17,827
"Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

1749
02:31:17,952 --> 02:31:20,830
If you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1750
02:31:20,956 --> 02:31:23,250
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1751
02:31:23,375 --> 02:31:26,461
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1752
02:31:26,588 --> 02:31:29,716
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

1753
02:31:29,841 --> 02:31:32,677
scuttling across floors
of silent seas."

1754
02:31:32,803 --> 02:31:35,014
- I mean...
- Stay with the boat.

1755
02:31:35,139 --> 02:31:39,560
Don't go any... Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

1756
02:31:41,354 --> 02:31:44,691
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

1757
02:31:44,817 --> 02:31:46,694
and he can be right.

1758
02:31:46,819 --> 02:31:49,822
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1759
02:31:53,243 --> 02:31:55,162
I mean...

1760
02:31:57,707 --> 02:32:01,210
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

1761
02:32:01,336 --> 02:32:04,339
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1762
02:32:04,465 --> 02:32:07,176
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1763
02:32:07,301 --> 02:32:09,678
Because I took his picture.

1764
02:32:09,804 --> 02:32:13,350
He said, "If you take
my picture again...

1765
02:32:13,475 --> 02:32:16,019
I'm gonna kill you."

1766
02:32:16,103 --> 02:32:18,022
And he meant it.

1767
02:32:19,732 --> 02:32:22,401
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

1768
02:32:22,527 --> 02:32:24,446
Lay back. Dig it.

1769
02:32:24,571 --> 02:32:27,449
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1770
02:32:27,575 --> 02:32:30,870
But you don't... you don't...
you don't judge the colonel.

1771
02:32:30,995 --> 02:32:33,665
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1772
02:32:40,465 --> 02:32:43,051
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1773
02:32:43,176 --> 02:32:46,012
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

1774
02:32:46,097 --> 02:32:49,475
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold... Hey, hello. Hello.

1775
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:51,519
Could you hold up
a minute?

1776
02:33:13,587 --> 02:33:14,963
Colby.

1777
02:33:31,107 --> 02:33:32,817
The heads.

1778
02:33:32,943 --> 02:33:35,112
You're looking at the heads.

1779
02:33:35,237 --> 02:33:38,407
I, uh... Sometimes
he goes too far.

1780
02:33:38,532 --> 02:33:41,243
He's the first one
to admit it.

1781
02:33:42,329 --> 02:33:45,248
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1782
02:33:46,584 --> 02:33:49,420
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago...

1783
02:33:49,545 --> 02:33:52,173
if you could have heard
him then, God...

1784
02:33:52,299 --> 02:33:55,552
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

1785
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,974
I just wanna talk to him.

1786
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:04,604
Well, man, he's gone away.

1787
02:34:04,730 --> 02:34:07,441
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1788
02:34:07,566 --> 02:34:10,653
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1789
02:34:10,779 --> 02:34:13,657
He forgets himself
with his people.

1790
02:34:15,033 --> 02:34:17,786
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1791
02:34:17,912 --> 02:34:20,915
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1792
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,500
- I think you should...
- Okay, Chef.

1793
02:34:22,626 --> 02:34:24,836
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

1794
02:34:24,962 --> 02:34:27,673
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1795
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:53,452
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1796
02:34:53,578 --> 02:34:56,123
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

1797
02:34:56,248 --> 02:34:58,625
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

1798
02:34:58,751 --> 02:35:01,212
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1799
02:35:02,255 --> 02:35:05,466
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1800
02:35:05,592 --> 02:35:08,637
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

1801
02:35:08,762 --> 02:35:11,974
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

1802
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:15,895
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1803
02:35:16,021 --> 02:35:20,650
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1804
02:35:22,279 --> 02:35:26,158
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

1805
02:35:26,283 --> 02:35:29,494
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

1806
02:35:29,621 --> 02:35:32,832
But now, fuck...

1807
02:35:34,418 --> 02:35:37,338
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1808
02:35:37,463 --> 02:35:41,258
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1809
02:35:41,384 --> 02:35:44,304
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1810
02:35:44,429 --> 02:35:48,725
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

1811
02:35:48,851 --> 02:35:51,270
See if I can find
the colonel, okay?

1812
02:35:52,606 --> 02:35:55,609
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1813
02:35:55,734 --> 02:35:58,862
Here. You take the radio...

1814
02:35:58,988 --> 02:36:03,284
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

1815
02:36:04,828 --> 02:36:07,456
you call in the air strike.

1816
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:11,543
"Air strike?"

1817
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:13,546
The code is "Almighty"...

1818
02:36:13,672 --> 02:36:17,050
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1819
02:36:17,176 --> 02:36:19,345
It's all in there.

1820
02:36:20,888 --> 02:36:24,892
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1821
02:36:32,193 --> 02:36:36,155
<i>Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane. </i>

1822
02:36:39,827 --> 02:36:41,870
<i>The place was full of bodies... </i>

1823
02:36:41,997 --> 02:36:46,167
<i>North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians. </i>

1824
02:36:53,217 --> 02:36:57,555
<i>If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way. </i>

1825
02:37:30,762 --> 02:37:34,474

slow death in there... </i>

1826
02:37:34,599 --> 02:37:36,893
<i>malaria... </i>

1827
02:37:37,019 --> 02:37:38,896
<i>and nightmares. </i>

1828
02:37:40,814 --> 02:37:43,734

of the river, all right. </i>

1829
02:37:57,167 --> 02:37:59,419
Where are you from, Willard?

1830
02:38:04,258 --> 02:38:06,719
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1831
02:38:11,684 --> 02:38:14,019
Were you born there?

1832
02:38:14,145 --> 02:38:16,314
Yes, sir.

1833
02:38:16,439 --> 02:38:18,608
Whereabouts?

1834
02:38:18,734 --> 02:38:20,611
Toledo, sir.

1835
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:29,204
How far are you
from the river?

1836
02:38:35,336 --> 02:38:37,255
The Ohio River, sir?

1837
02:38:39,591 --> 02:38:41,468
About 200 miles.

1838
02:38:49,353 --> 02:38:52,565
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1839
02:38:57,070 --> 02:39:00,073
There's a place in the river...
I can't remember...

1840
02:39:00,198 --> 02:39:05,412
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1841
02:39:05,538 --> 02:39:09,667
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about...

1842
02:39:09,793 --> 02:39:12,254
for about five miles
you'd think that...

1843
02:39:12,379 --> 02:39:15,841
heaven just fell
on the earth...

1844
02:39:15,967 --> 02:39:18,345
in the form of gardenias.

1845
02:39:34,530 --> 02:39:36,407
Have you ever considered...

1846
02:39:38,243 --> 02:39:40,120
any real freedoms?

1847
02:39:45,251 --> 02:39:49,005
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

1848
02:39:51,676 --> 02:39:54,970
Even the opinions
of yourself?

1849
02:40:09,989 --> 02:40:14,243
Did they say why, Willard?

1850
02:40:15,787 --> 02:40:20,583
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1851
02:40:36,019 --> 02:40:39,522
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

1852
02:40:42,484 --> 02:40:46,488
It's no longer
classified, is it?

1853
02:40:53,039 --> 02:40:55,291
What did they tell you?

1854
02:40:57,669 --> 02:41:00,047
They told me...

1855
02:41:00,172 --> 02:41:02,799
that you had gone...

1856
02:41:02,925 --> 02:41:04,802
totally insane...

1857
02:41:06,929 --> 02:41:10,933
and that your methods...

1858
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:13,979
were unsound.

1859
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:19,903
Are my methods unsound?

1860
02:41:25,326 --> 02:41:28,954
I don't see any method...

1861
02:41:30,457 --> 02:41:32,334
at all, sir.

1862
02:41:38,466 --> 02:41:41,052
I expected...

1863
02:41:41,178 --> 02:41:43,347
someone like you.

1864
02:41:45,433 --> 02:41:47,477
What did you expect?

1865
02:41:55,069 --> 02:41:56,987
Are you an assassin?

1866
02:42:01,743 --> 02:42:03,495
I'm a soldier.

1867
02:42:06,541 --> 02:42:08,418
You're neither.

1868
02:42:10,129 --> 02:42:13,298
You're an errand boy...

1869
02:42:13,424 --> 02:42:16,093
sent by grocery clerks...

1870
02:42:19,514 --> 02:42:22,267
to collect the bill.

1871
02:43:05,276 --> 02:43:07,195
Why, huh?

1872
02:43:07,320 --> 02:43:11,407
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1873
02:43:18,041 --> 02:43:20,251
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1874
02:43:20,377 --> 02:43:21,795
Why?

1875
02:43:23,339 --> 02:43:25,383
Do you know...

1876
02:43:25,508 --> 02:43:28,177
Do you know that the man...

1877
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:33,266
the man really likes you?

1878
02:43:36,479 --> 02:43:38,564
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1879
02:43:38,690 --> 02:43:43,569
But he's got something
in mind for you.

1880
02:43:43,696 --> 02:43:46,240
Aren't you curious about that?

1881
02:43:46,365 --> 02:43:51,328
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1882
02:43:54,166 --> 02:43:57,420
There's something
happening out here, man.

1883
02:44:01,174 --> 02:44:03,510
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

1884
02:44:03,635 --> 02:44:06,471
That's right, Jack.

1885
02:44:06,597 --> 02:44:09,559
The man is clear
in his mind...

1886
02:44:09,684 --> 02:44:11,978
but his soul is mad.

1887
02:44:13,230 --> 02:44:15,733
Oh, yeah.

1888
02:44:15,858 --> 02:44:17,735
He's dying, I think.

1889
02:44:17,861 --> 02:44:20,905
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1890
02:44:21,031 --> 02:44:24,075
But the man's...

1891
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:30,750
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

1892
02:44:32,627 --> 02:44:34,463
And a voice...

1893
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:37,133
a voice...

1894
02:44:39,635 --> 02:44:42,305
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

1895
02:44:42,431 --> 02:44:47,478
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

1896
02:44:47,604 --> 02:44:51,483
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

1897
02:44:51,608 --> 02:44:54,319
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

1898
02:44:54,445 --> 02:44:58,991
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1899
02:44:59,116 --> 02:45:02,828
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

1900
02:45:02,954 --> 02:45:06,458
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

Bullshit, man!

1902

Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1903
02:45:16,804 --> 02:45:18,972
You.

1904
02:45:23,144 --> 02:45:25,271
Almost eight hours.

02:45:32,989 --> 02:45:36,493
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1907
02:45:48,048 --> 02:45:49,466
Fuck.

two-and-a-half years

This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

1964
02:56:17,073 --> 02:56:20,618
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

1965
02:56:20,744 --> 02:56:24,122
You can't travel in space. You can't
go out into space, you know...

1966
02:56:24,248 --> 02:56:26,250
without like, you know,
with fractions.

1967
02:56:26,376 --> 02:56:28,837
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1968
02:56:28,962 --> 02:56:31,339
What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

1969
02:56:31,464 --> 02:56:32,841
That's dialectic physics, okay.

1970
02:56:32,967 --> 02:56:35,344
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

1971
02:56:35,469 --> 02:56:37,429
You either love somebody
or you hate 'em.

1972
02:56:37,555 --> 02:56:38,389
Mutt!

1973
02:56:40,600 --> 02:56:43,395
You mutt.

1974
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:46,231
This is the way
the fucking world is.

1975
02:56:46,357 --> 02:56:48,901
Look at this fucking shit
we're in, man!

1976
02:56:49,026 --> 02:56:50,945
Not with a bang.
A whimper.

1977
02:56:51,071 --> 02:56:54,575
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.

1978
02:57:23,275 --> 02:57:26,153
<i>On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him... </i>

1979
02:57:26,278 --> 02:57:27,946
<i>I'd know what to do. </i>

1980
02:57:28,823 --> 02:57:31,868
<i>But it didn't happen. </i>

1981
02:57:31,993 --> 02:57:36,164
<i>I was in there with him
for days. Not under guard. </i>

1982
02:57:36,290 --> 02:57:38,626
<i>I was free. </i>

1983
02:57:38,751 --> 02:57:41,962
<i>But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere. </i>

1984
02:57:42,088 --> 02:57:45,675
<i>He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did. </i>

1985
02:57:52,643 --> 02:57:56,897
<i>If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw... </i>

1986
02:57:57,022 --> 02:57:59,358
<i>would they still want me
to kill him? </i>

1987
02:58:00,944 --> 02:58:03,947
<i>More than ever, probably. </i>

1988
02:58:04,073 --> 02:58:06,992
<i>And what would his people back home
want if they ever learned... </i>

1989
02:58:07,117 --> 02:58:09,662
<i>just how far from them
he'd really gone? </i>

1990
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:13,750
<i>He broke from them... </i>

1991
02:58:13,875 --> 02:58:16,586
<i>and then he broke
from himself. </i>

1992
02:58:16,712 --> 02:58:20,049
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and... </i>

1993
02:58:20,174 --> 02:58:22,051
<i>ripped apart. </i>

1994
02:58:22,177 --> 02:58:24,847
I've seen the horrors...

1995
02:58:24,972 --> 02:58:27,307
horrors that you've seen.

1996
02:58:28,852 --> 02:58:30,854
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1997
02:58:30,979 --> 02:58:34,065
You have a right to kill me.

1998
02:58:34,191 --> 02:58:37,069
You have a right
to do that.

1999
02:58:38,320 --> 02:58:40,906
But you have no right
to judge me.

2000
02:58:47,248 --> 02:58:49,542
It's impossible for words...

2001
02:58:51,252 --> 02:58:52,795
to describe...

2002
02:58:54,756 --> 02:58:58,051
what is necessary...

2003
02:59:00,096 --> 02:59:02,348
to those...

2004
02:59:02,473 --> 02:59:04,976
who do not know...

2005
02:59:05,102 --> 02:59:08,689
what horror means.

2006
02:59:10,525 --> 02:59:11,902
Horror.

2007
02:59:14,696 --> 02:59:17,574
Horror has a face.

2008
02:59:19,869 --> 02:59:23,206
And you must make
a friend of horror.

2009
02:59:23,290 --> 02:59:26,919
Horror and moral terror...

2010
02:59:27,044 --> 02:59:28,921
are your friends.

2011
02:59:29,047 --> 02:59:31,174
If they are not...

2012
02:59:31,299 --> 02:59:35,053
then they are enemies
to be feared.

2013
02:59:35,179 --> 02:59:37,556
They are truly enemies.

2014
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:46,107
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

2015
02:59:49,570 --> 02:59:53,574
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

2016
02:59:57,037 --> 02:59:59,790
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

2017
03:00:02,043 --> 03:00:03,628
some children.

2018
03:00:07,508 --> 03:00:10,219
We'd left the camp...

2019
03:00:10,344 --> 03:00:13,597
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

2020
03:00:15,267 --> 03:00:17,936
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

2021
03:00:18,062 --> 03:00:19,981
He couldn't say.

2022
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:24,652
We went back there...

2023
03:00:24,778 --> 03:00:28,490
and they had come
and hacked off...

2024
03:00:28,615 --> 03:00:31,159
every inoculated arm.

2025
03:00:32,704 --> 03:00:35,081
There they were,
in a pile...

2026
03:00:35,206 --> 03:00:36,749
a pile of...

2027
03:00:38,377 --> 03:00:40,296
little arms.

2028
03:00:41,548 --> 03:00:44,551
And I remember...

2029
03:00:46,052 --> 03:00:49,097
I-I... I cried.

2030
03:00:49,223 --> 03:00:51,142
I wept like...

2031
03:00:52,727 --> 03:00:55,938
some grandmother.

2032
03:00:57,649 --> 03:01:02,446
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2033
03:01:02,572 --> 03:01:05,658
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

2034
03:01:05,784 --> 03:01:08,495
I never want to forget.

2035
03:01:08,621 --> 03:01:11,373
And then I realized...

2036
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:14,461
like I was shot...

2037
03:01:14,586 --> 03:01:17,797
like I was shot
with a diamond...

2038
03:01:17,924 --> 03:01:21,594
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

2039
03:01:23,137 --> 03:01:27,016
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.

2040
03:01:27,142 --> 03:01:29,520
The genius."

2041
03:01:29,645 --> 03:01:32,397
The will to do that.

2042
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:38,655
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

2043
03:01:40,574 --> 03:01:42,451
And then I realized...

2044
03:01:42,577 --> 03:01:46,373
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

2045
03:01:46,498 --> 03:01:49,209
These were not monsters.
These were men...

2046
03:01:49,335 --> 03:01:51,837
trained cadres.

2047
03:01:51,963 --> 03:01:54,590
These men who fought
with their hearts...

2048
03:01:54,716 --> 03:01:56,677
who have families,
who have children...

2049
03:01:56,802 --> 03:01:58,720
who are filled with love...

2050
03:01:58,845 --> 03:02:02,182
that they had the strength...

2051
03:02:02,308 --> 03:02:04,227
the strength...

2052
03:02:07,898 --> 03:02:09,775
to do that.

2053
03:02:09,900 --> 03:02:14,905
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

2054
03:02:15,031 --> 03:02:18,535
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2055
03:02:20,162 --> 03:02:23,291
You have to have men...

2056
03:02:23,374 --> 03:02:25,293
who are moral...

2057
03:02:26,753 --> 03:02:29,047
and at the same time...

2058
03:02:29,172 --> 03:02:31,258
who are able to...

2059
03:02:32,343 --> 03:02:34,262
utilize their...

2060
03:02:36,556 --> 03:02:40,310
primordial instincts to kill...

2061
03:02:40,436 --> 03:02:43,397
without feeling,
without passion...

2062
03:02:44,649 --> 03:02:48,278
without judgment...
without judgment.

2063
03:02:52,658 --> 03:02:56,162
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

2064
03:03:14,726 --> 03:03:17,938
I worry that my son...

2065
03:03:18,063 --> 03:03:21,983
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

2066
03:03:24,237 --> 03:03:29,367
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

2067
03:03:30,577 --> 03:03:33,330
I would want someone
to go to my home...

2068
03:03:33,456 --> 03:03:36,793
and tell my son everything.

2069
03:03:39,255 --> 03:03:43,717
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

2070
03:03:43,843 --> 03:03:47,847
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

2071
03:03:47,973 --> 03:03:50,308
<i>the stench of lies. </i>

2072
03:03:52,436 --> 03:03:55,690
<i>And if you understand me,
Willard, you... </i>

2073
03:03:57,568 --> 03:04:00,696
<i>you will do this for me. </i>

2074
03:05:06,189 --> 03:05:09,943
<i>PBRStreet Gang,
this is Almighty. Over. </i>

2075
03:05:10,069 --> 03:05:13,948
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over. </i>

2076
03:05:15,325 --> 03:05:19,996
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy? </i>

2077
03:05:24,710 --> 03:05:28,172
<i>They were gonna make me
a major for this... </i>

2078
03:05:28,298 --> 03:05:31,301
<i>and I wasn't even in
their fuckin' army any more. </i>

2079
03:05:33,555 --> 03:05:36,975
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it. </i>

2080
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:40,019
<i>Him most of all. </i>

2081
03:05:40,145 --> 03:05:42,565
<i>I felt like he was up there... </i>

2082
03:05:42,690 --> 03:05:45,818
<i>waiting for me
to take the pain away. </i>

2083
03:05:47,904 --> 03:05:50,490
<i>He just wanted to go out
like a soldier... </i>

2084
03:05:50,615 --> 03:05:53,326
<i>standing up. </i>

2085
03:05:53,411 --> 03:05:57,456
<i>Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade. </i>

2086
03:06:00,794 --> 03:06:03,880
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead. </i>

2087
03:06:04,007 --> 03:06:07,260
<i>And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway. </i>

2088
03:06:47,098 --> 03:06:50,977
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2089
03:06:55,775 --> 03:06:59,946
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2090
03:07:04,327 --> 03:07:07,372
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2091
03:07:07,497 --> 03:07:12,710
<i>And meet me at the back
of the blue bus tonight</i>

2092
03:07:12,836 --> 03:07:15,339
<i>Blue bus tonight</i>

2093
03:07:15,464 --> 03:07:18,509
<i>Blue bus tonight
Blue</i>

2094
03:07:18,635 --> 03:07:22,013
<i>Come on, yeah</i>

2095
03:07:24,225 --> 03:07:26,936
We train young men
to drop fire on people...

2096
03:07:27,061 --> 03:07:30,481
but their commanders...

2097
03:07:30,607 --> 03:07:34,152
won't allow them
to write "fuck"...

2098
03:07:34,278 --> 03:07:37,322
on their aeroplanes because...

2099
03:07:37,407 --> 03:07:39,325
it's obscene.

2100
03:09:02,130 --> 03:09:04,007
The horror.

2101
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:09,055
The horror.

2102
03:14:31,806 --> 03:14:33,808
<i>Calling PBRStreet Gang. </i>

2103
03:14:34,810 --> 03:14:38,230
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over. </i>

2104
03:14:39,690 --> 03:14:42,359
<i>PBRStreet Gang? </i>

2105
03:14:42,485 --> 03:14:44,612
<i>PBRStreet Gang,
this is Almighty... </i>

2106
03:15:22,407 --> 03:15:23,992
<i>The horror. </i>

2107
03:15:27,912 --> 03:15:29,497
<i>The horror. </i>
