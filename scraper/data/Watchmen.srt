1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,941
Wrong, as usual.

2
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,236
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...

3
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,824
...proves that the Soviet Union's aggression
at the Afghan border...

4
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,161
...will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:44,543
The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,963
...conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,051
...just 1500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

8
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,597
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

9
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,267
The United States does not start fights.

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,104
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

11
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,066
...in order to maintain peace...

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,986
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

13
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,198
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

14
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,992
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,828
As a result of the Soviet activity...

16
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,790
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

17
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:28,337
...moved the Doomsday Clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

18
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,841
destruction by nuclear war.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,219
Question:

20
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,013
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

21
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,516
...10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

22
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:45,187
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

23
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,688
Pat Buchanan.

24
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,190
Zero.

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,984
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

26
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,988
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

27
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,616
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,870
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

29
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,790
Well, it hasn't
stopped the Soviet Union...

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,628
...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,505
You don't think it's just posturing?

32
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,257
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,968
...are doing these bomb tests...

34
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,514
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

35
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,226
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

36
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,689
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters--

37
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,769
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

38
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,030
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

39
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,950
Mother, forgive me.

40
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,693
I was a hero, goddamn it!

41
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,282
 --an act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...

42
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,787
...that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.

43
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,618
Fuck you, pigs!

44
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,860
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

45
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,825
Get out of here, vigilantes!

46
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,710
No!

47
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:43,785
Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

48
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,162
Guy was built like a linebacker.

49
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,248
Yeah, I saw the body.

50
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,458
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

51
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,294
You mean apart from being dead?

52
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,047
That's plate glass.

53
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,134
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

54
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,344
Had to have been thrown.

55
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,721
Check the bedroom?

56
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,807
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

57
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,060
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

58
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,687
Or made to look like one.

59
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,647
See this?

60
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,151
-Shaking hands with the president.
Whoa.

61
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,570
Think Blake was a spook?

62
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,407
Government or black ops?

63
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,617
I think...

64
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,204
...this is way bigger than both of us.

65
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,629
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

66
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:41,885
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on burst stomach.

67
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,387
This city's afraid of me.

68
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,516
I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters...

69
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,561
...and the gutters are full of blood.

70
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,189
And when the drains finally scab over...

71
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,525
...all the vermin will drown.

72
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,528
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder...

73
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,031
...will foam up around their waists...

74
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,661
...and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us."

75
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,249
And I'll whisper, "No."

76
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,629
Now the whole world
stands on the brink...

77
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,298
...staring down into bloody hell.

78
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,010
All those liberals and intellectuals...

79
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,179
...and smooth talkers...

80
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,808
...and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

81
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,144
Beneath me, this awful city.

82
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,065
It screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children...

83
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,903
...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

84
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,934
Huh.

85
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,613
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

86
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,156
Somebody knows why.

87
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,700
Somebody knows.

88
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,499
No, I definitely heard something.

89
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,129
Watch the door.

90
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,989
Shh.

91
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,409
Must've been the wind. Next time you--

92
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:13,179
It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

93
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,933
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

94
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,727
They thought it was funny:
dress up and pull heists.

95
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,107
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

96
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,111
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

97
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,571
So a few of us cops, we get together...

98
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,075
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

99
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,953
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

100
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,791
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

101
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,628
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

102
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,298
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

103
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,844
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

104
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,222
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

105
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,934
Oh, don't get me started on him.

106
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:06,107
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

107
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,151
I think you were trying to make a point.

108
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,241
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys--

109
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,537
You guys who picked up where we left off.
--with Nixon forcing you out.

110
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,043
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

111
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,962
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

112
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,552
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

113
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,722
Truth?

114
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,143
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

115
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,022
-Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
-Hey.

116
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,482
Watch it with the language.

117
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,276
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

118
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,819
-Yeah.
This just in:

119
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,905
The masked vigilante
known as Rorschach...

120
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,908
...has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.

121
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,787
Rorschach is on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list...

122
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,749
...for violation of the Keene Act,
which banned masked heroes six years ago.

123
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,168
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated....

124
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,129
Forced everyone out except him.

125
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,839
Oh, he'll quit.

126
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,341
When he's dead.

127
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,052
Next week?
Well...

128
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,848
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

129
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,184
If you got a hot date or something....

130
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,145
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

131
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,774
You ever miss it?

132
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,069
No. You?

133
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,446
Oh, heck, no.

134
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,533
Be seeing you.

135
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,608
Hello, Daniel.

136
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,443
Rorschach.

137
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,781
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

138
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,409
No, no. Course not.

139
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,580
You want me to heat those up for you?

140
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,290
Fine like this.

141
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,043
How have you been keeping?

142
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,216
Out of prison.

143
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,136
Heard about you on the news.

144
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,972
Say you attacked a cop.

145
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,934
Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

146
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,977
Daniel...

147
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,437
...look at this.

148
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,820
Is this bean juice?
Human bean juice.

149
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,034
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

150
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,496
Let's talk downstairs.

151
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,173
It could have been a burglary.

152
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,051
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

153
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,973
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

154
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,978
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

155
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,314
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

156
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,401
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

157
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,860
Maybe.

158
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,281
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

159
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,533
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

160
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,286
That what they say about me now?

161
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,787
Paranoid?

162
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,790
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

163
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,458
...even among his friends.

164
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,794
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

165
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,632
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

166
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,886
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

167
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,891
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

168
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,730
-You were never that sentimental.
-Attack on one is attack on all of us.

169
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,566
What do you suggest we do about it?

170
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,651
Retribution.

171
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,364
-Watchmen are over.
-Says Tricky Dick.

172
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,283
Says me.

173
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,537
Nobody knows who you are.

174
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,665
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

175
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,753
That what you have now?
A normal life?

176
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,090
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

177
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,759
...past the human cockroaches...

178
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,678
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

179
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,388
...do you really feel normal?

180
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,267
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

181
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,437
No.

182
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,232
You're hiding in plain sight.

183
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,778
Be seeing you, Dan.

184
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,739
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

185
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,616
Yeah, I remember.

186
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,870
Came here often,
when we were partners.

187
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,955
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

188
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,667
-What happened?
-You quit.

189
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,317
Rorschach's journal.

190
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,820
First visit of evening fruitless.

191
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,114
Feel slightly depressed.

192
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,533
Soon there will be war.

193
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,286
Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

194
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,997
Why does one death matter
against so many?

195
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,503
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

196
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,506
Even in the face of armageddon...

197
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,509
...I will not compromise in this.

198
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,555
But there are so many
deserving of retribution...

199
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,015
...and so little time.

200
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,217
Captain.

201
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,845
-Captain.
-Ridley.

202
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,015
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

203
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,224
No, sir.

204
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:41,854
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

205
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,399
-It's pulling me under.
-Hold on.

206
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,570
Ridley.

207
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,125
Ridley. Ridley.

208
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,085
No.

209
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,754
No.

210
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,381
More blood, more blood, more blood.

211
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,051
Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.

212
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,596
The Black Freighter.

213
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:21,185
The hell-bound ship's black sails
against the yellow Indies sky.

214
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,691
I knew again the stench of powder
and men's brains and war.

215
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,613
More blood, more blood, more blood.

216
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,748
More blood, more blood, more blood.

217
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,673
The waves about me were scarlet...

218
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,842
...foaming, horribly warm
in the Freighter's wake.

219
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,179
In despair, I offered my weathered soul
to almighty God...

220
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,849
...his mercy and his judgment.

221
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,978
Heh. What do you think, kid?

222
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,273
We ought to nuke Russia
and let God sort it out.

223
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,484
Or at the very least,
send Dr. Manhattan over for a visit.

224
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,152
You know what I'm saying?

225
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,239
I mean, I ain't trying to be an asshole
or anything, but they're the ones...

226
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,908
...who are agitating us.
Now this is just my opinion.

227
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,495
But I'm a news vendor, you know,
so I am informed.

228
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,666
Yeah, I know. The New Frontiersman.
Well, it's not here yet.

229
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,668
I'd appreciate if you didn't
stand around waiting...

230
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,337
...because I don't know when
it's going to be here.

231
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,506
I thought you said you was informed.

232
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,636
-Are you gonna buy that?
-No.

233
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,350
Oh, Jesus.
Just try again tomorrow, okay?

234
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,820
Mr. Veidt...

235
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,114
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

236
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,700
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

237
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,702
...the first being Hollis Mason.

238
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,872
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

239
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,294
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

240
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,547
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

241
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,758
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

242
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,137
-I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
I'm sorry. Do you think--

243
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,890
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

244
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,768
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

245
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,979
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

246
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,149
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

247
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,902
...sells more magazines.

248
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:40,199
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

249
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,285
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

250
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,705
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

251
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,875
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

252
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,461
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

253
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,048
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

254
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,718
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

255
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,764
But if we make resources infinite...

256
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,058
...ah...

257
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,310
...we make war obsolete.

258
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,981
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

259
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,859
...wherever they may be.

260
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,321
Thanks for your time.

261
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,247
-You look good, Adrian.
-Dan.

262
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,624
It's been too long.

263
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,463
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

264
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,966
You think it's possible?

265
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,885
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

266
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,972
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

267
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,976
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

268
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,854
You know that better than anyone.

269
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,231
I'm not here because I miss him.

270
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,733
It's occurred to Rorschach...

271
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,861
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

272
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,488
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

273
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,700
That's why I'm warning you first.

274
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,330
Thank you, Dan...

275
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,711
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

276
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,505
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

277
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,511
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

278
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,348
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

279
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,685
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

280
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,064
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

281
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,195
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

282
00:29:55,418 --> 00:30:01,048
Rorschach's journal,
October 13th, 1985...

283
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,550
...8:30 p.m.

284
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,180
Meeting with Dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth.

285
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,434
A flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

286
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,563
Why are so few of us left active...

287
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:21,610
...healthy and without
personality disorders?

288
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,030
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.

289
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,575
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, aging whore...

290
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,620
...dying in a California rest resort.

291
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,414
Dollar Bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door...

292
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,083
...where he got gunned down.

293
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,127
Silhouette, murdered...

294
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,422
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.

295
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,968
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.

296
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,184
Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual.

297
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,854
Must investigate further.

298
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,773
Only two names remain on my list.

299
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:05,445
Both share private quarters
at Rockefeller Military Research Center.

300
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,948
I shall go to them.

301
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:13,620
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

302
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,248
Good evening, Rorschach.

303
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,918
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

304
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,503
Yes...

305
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,756
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

306
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,635
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

307
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,013
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

308
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,265
I have a real name I've been using.

309
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,474
Try it.

310
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,727
Whatever you say, Laurie.

311
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,145
What are you doing here?

312
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,647
The Comedian is dead.

313
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,900
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

314
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,694
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

315
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,989
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

316
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,036
Even if I wanted to help...

317
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,540
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

318
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,003
-I cannot see it clearly.
-Interference? Caused by what?

319
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,590
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

320
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,428
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

321
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,599
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

322
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,729
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

323
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,691
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

324
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,902
I must return to my work.

325
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,195
Wait a minute.

326
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,864
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

327
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,283
So we can't do anything to stop it?

328
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,285
Goodbye, Rorschach.

329
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,704
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

330
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,206
I'm not leaving--

331
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,834
--till I've had my say.

332
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,261
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

333
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,139
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

334
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,727
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

335
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,980
But you always say time is simultaneous.

336
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,566
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

337
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:11,738
If only you could perceive time as I do.

338
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,156
Please let me show you.

339
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:24,084
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

340
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,295
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

341
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,923
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

342
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,843
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

343
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,180
-It was a mistake. One time.
-Man tries to rape you--

344
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,849
Stop!

345
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,101
Your mind goes to dark places...

346
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,603
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

347
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,944
-Say hello to Dan for me.
-What?

348
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,532
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

349
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,411
...like we used to...

350
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,955
...but you won't.

351
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,000
You know I can't.

352
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,921
So you'll call Dan...

353
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,549
...which is only natural.

354
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,469
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

355
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,338
Dan Dreiberg's table.

356
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,238
Did you know that
he and H.J. were--? I had no idea.

357
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,825
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

358
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,493
Captain Carnage.

359
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,871
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

360
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,415
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

361
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,627
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

362
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,588
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

363
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,383
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

364
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,970
God, whatever happened to him?

365
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,305
Oh. Um....
He pulled that on Rorschach...

366
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,891
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

367
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,733
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

368
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,945
-It's a little funny.
-Yep.

369
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,824
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

370
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,951
It's really good to see you again.

371
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,745
It's great seeing you too.

372
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,082
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

373
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,545
-No one else would.
-Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

374
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,798
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

375
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,926
Uh.... Yeah, yeah, awful.

376
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,554
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

377
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,725
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

378
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,979
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

379
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,441
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

380
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,279
What?

381
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,743
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

382
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,621
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

383
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,581
Soon.

384
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,793
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

385
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,005
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

386
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,966
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

387
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,387
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

388
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,765
Everyone.

389
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,518
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

390
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,729
...or if he's just pretending.

391
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,358
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

392
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,114
Hold on, I'll get the door.

393
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,243
Thanks, Dan.

394
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,662
-Got it?
-Yeah.

395
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,045
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

396
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,841
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

397
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,844
I'm sorry.

398
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,890
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

399
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,644
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

400
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,606
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

401
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,713
Laurie? Is that you?

402
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,386
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

403
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,057
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

404
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,102
Well, it beats flying coach.

405
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,479
Margarita?

406
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,856
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

407
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,027
Mm.

408
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,988
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

409
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,659
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

410
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,996
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

411
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:21,209
-He sent you this?
-Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

412
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,711
Mother, this is gross.

413
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,172
I think it's kind of flattering.

414
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,591
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

415
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,013
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

416
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,016
I saw it in the paper.

417
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,603
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

418
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,400
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

419
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,695
-Poor Eddie.
-Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

420
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,947
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

421
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,658
You don't know.

422
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,577
Things change.

423
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,205
What happened happened 40 years ago.

424
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,625
I'm 67 years old.

425
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,005
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

426
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,008
But the past...

427
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,511
...even the grimy parts of it...

428
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,681
...keep on getting brighter.

429
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,023
I've got spots in my eyes.

430
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,154
Stop it, Eddie.

431
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,492
-Thank you, Weegee.
-Thank you, Mr. Owl.

432
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,913
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

433
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,249
-Little place on 21st.
-Sounds good.

434
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:48,004
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

435
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,510
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

436
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,027
Eddie.

437
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,157
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

438
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,951
Sure I did.

439
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,162
Come on, baby.

440
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,623
I know what you need.

441
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,835
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

442
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,296
I said no, Eddie.

443
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,843
-No spelled Y-E-S.
-No spelled N-O.

444
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,472
-All right?
-Come on, sweetheart.

445
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,978
Eddie....

446
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,563
You little bastard.

447
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,195
This what you like?

448
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,865
-This what makes you hot?
-What?

449
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,545
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

450
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,841
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

451
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,845
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

452
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,683
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

453
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,270
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

454
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,232
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

455
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,987
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

456
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,240
...O holy and merciful savior.

457
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,619
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

458
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,122
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any--

459
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,503
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

460
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:02,425
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

461
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,928
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

462
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:11,058
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

463
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,521
But we didn't, thanks to you.

464
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,442
You sound bitter.

465
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,277
Me? Bitter?

466
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,530
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

467
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,705
Oh, Jesus Christ.

468
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,875
-Mr. Eddie?
-Just what I fucking needed.

469
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:41,088
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

470
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,384
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

471
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,886
I'm gonna forget about you...

472
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,889
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

473
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,641
Get the fuck out of here.

474
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,228
-No.
-Get the fuck out of here.

475
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,771
You will remember.

476
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,275
You will remember me and my country...

477
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,778
...forever!

478
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,241
My face!

479
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,619
Blake. Don't.

480
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,746
Blake!

481
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,089
She was pregnant...

482
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,092
...and you gunned her down.

483
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,552
That's right...

484
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,637
...and you know what? You watched me.

485
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,807
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

486
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,602
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

487
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,357
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

488
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,361
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

489
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,115
God help us all.

490
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,451
Medic!

491
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,461
Most holy and merciful savior.

492
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,301
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

493
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,638
In the midst of life, we are in death.

494
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:17,143
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

495
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,609
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

496
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,861
We're waiting for one more.

497
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,000
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

498
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,003
Welcome, doctor.

499
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,088
Now we can start.

500
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,092
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

501
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,595
This is all bullshit.

502
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,767
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

503
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,354
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

504
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,315
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

505
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,609
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

506
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,153
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

507
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,700
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

508
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:19,205
A group this size seems like
a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

509
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,165
We can do so much more.

510
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,542
We can save this world...

511
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,297
-...with the right leadership.
-Yeah.

512
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,426
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

513
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,388
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

514
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,224
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

515
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:42,228
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

516
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,896
You people.

517
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,566
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

518
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,569
-You think catching him matters?
-Justice matters.

519
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,948
Justice.

520
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,575
Justice is coming to all of us.

521
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,244
No matter what the fuck we do.

522
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,915
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

523
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:07,920
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

524
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,757
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

525
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,929
Then Ozymandias here...

526
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,224
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

527
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,193
For as much as it hath pleased...

528
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:36,323
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

529
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,787
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

530
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,458
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes....

531
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:15,488
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

532
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:24,038
Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

533
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,667
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

534
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,004
If you could--
Please, there's no need for violence.

535
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:37,051
We are trying to retain order on the streets
until the police strike is over.

536
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,428
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

537
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,764
-I got rubber bullets.
I want my rights!

538
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,558
-You are not the law!
 We want regular cops!

539
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,018
No more vigilantes!

540
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,730
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

541
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,151
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

542
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,540
There's no need for violence.

543
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,876
Fuck you. Fuck you!

544
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,843
Oh, this is getting heavy.

545
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,662
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

546
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,248
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

547
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,083
How long can we keep this up?

548
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,837
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

549
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,255
Our days are numbered.

550
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,718
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

551
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:05,431
-From what?
-Are you kidding me? From themselves.

552
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,808
-Son of a bitch.
DAN: No, Comedian, wait!

553
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,270
Get your stinking hands off me.

554
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,900
What the hell happened to us?

555
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,531
What happened to the American dream?

556
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,202
What happened to the American dream?

557
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,495
It came true!

558
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,706
You're looking at it.

559
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,621
Edgar William Jacobi.

560
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,625
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

561
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,923
What are you talking about?

562
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,301
I'm a retired businessman--

563
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,431
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

564
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,641
I did my time.

565
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,603
I'm not Moloch anymore.

566
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,649
-What do you want from me?
-Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

567
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,278
I just felt I should...

568
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,366
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

569
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:17,581
-How'd you know he was the Comedian?
-He broke in here. A week ago.

570
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,084
He had his mask off.

571
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,046
-He was drunk.
-Enemies. For decades.

572
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,257
-Why should he visit you?
-I don't know.

573
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,344
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

574
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,471
He was upset.

575
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,598
He was crying.

576
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,393
Crying? The Comedian?

577
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,562
He was babbling, not making any sense.

578
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,732
I was pissing in my pants.

579
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,193
I thought he was gonna kill me.

580
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,654
What did he say?

581
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,615
It's a joke.

582
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,910
It's all a fucking joke.

583
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,331
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

584
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,543
I thought I knew how the world was.

585
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,338
I've done some bad things.

586
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,634
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

587
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,053
In 'Nam, you know.

588
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,055
But that was fucking war.

589
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,349
This....

590
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,686
I never done anything like this.

591
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,316
God, here I am...

592
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,569
...spilling my guts...

593
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,529
...to one of my archenemies.

594
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,033
But the truth is...

595
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,247
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?

596
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,378
Shit.

597
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,548
And your name...

598
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,259
...your name was on the list...

599
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,763
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

600
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,391
Manhattan's old girl.

601
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,731
Mother, forgive me.

602
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,567
And then he left.

603
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:14,198
I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

604
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,915
Funny story.

605
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,709
Sounds unbelievable.

606
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,420
Probably true.

607
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,256
So that's it?

608
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:35,594
-I'm clean?
-You?

609
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,096
Clean?

610
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,144
Amygdalin.

611
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,022
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

612
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,442
-It's illegal.
-Come on.

613
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,613
Please don't confiscate that.

614
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,283
I'm trying anything.

615
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,245
I have cancer.

616
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,580
What kind of cancer?

617
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,502
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

618
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,422
That ain't the kind I got.

619
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:19,638
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.

620
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,641
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

621
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,602
-Thought about Moloch's story.
-Come on.

622
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,688
Could all be lies.

623
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:32,150
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

624
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,447
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

625
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,199
But if it's true...

626
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,660
...what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...

627
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,662
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?

628
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,081
What was it he saw?

629
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,501
And that list he mentioned.

630
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,092
Edward Blake. The Comedian.

631
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,678
Born 1918.

632
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,847
Buried in the rain.

633
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,890
Murdered.

634
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:08,103
Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

635
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,190
Only our enemies leave roses.

636
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,402
Violent lives ending violently.

637
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:22,451
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

638
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,329
No matter how much you try
to dress it up...

639
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,623
...to disguise it...

640
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,917
...Blake saw society's true face.

641
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:35,714
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

642
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,549
I heard joke once.

643
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,554
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

644
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:46,558
Life seems harsh and cruel.

645
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:50,604
Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.

646
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,565
Doctor says treatment is simple.

647
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,403
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.

648
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,572
That should pick you up."

649
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,034
Man bursts into tears.

650
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:08,538
"But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci."

651
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,250
Good joke.

652
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,419
Everybody laugh.

653
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,755
Roll on snare drum.

654
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,757
Curtains.

655
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,511
Hey, Bernie.
 Yeah?

656
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,763
Can I get a Time magazine
from you there?

657
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,099
Sure.
-How much you want for it now?

658
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,517
For you, 2 bucks.

659
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,269
Two bucks. Going up, huh?

660
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,939
There you go. Thanks.

661
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,732
Hey, I like your book.

662
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,653
Hey, thanks, Bernie. I appreciate it.

663
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:35,000
 When I awoke,
I found myself upon a dismal beachhead...

664
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,543
...with my men.

665
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,046
Pieces of my men.

666
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,306
It was all I could do for her...

667
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,809
...though she had borne me
through seas of blood.

668
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:57,355
Her damp embrace had prevented me
from drifting beyond reach.

669
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:02,360
Yet this small comfort
was all I could offer.

670
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,331
One of my crew lay ahead.

671
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,501
Birds were eating
his thoughts and memories.

672
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,919
Away. Yah!

673
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,712
Yah! Get away.

674
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:26,343
In hell, at least the gulls are contented.

675
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:32,015
For my part,
I begged that they should take my eyes.

676
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,310
Thus sparing me future horrors.

677
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,233
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

678
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,026
Don't worry.

679
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,154
We've got plenty of time.

680
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,413
Your finger's like licking a battery.

681
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,478
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

682
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,980
Please don't be upset.

683
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,817
I always thought you liked this.

684
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,402
No.

685
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,865
I don't-- No.

686
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,535
I don't want that.

687
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,955
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

688
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,752
Look, I know you were just trying--

689
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,007
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

690
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:50,635
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

691
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,264
-I didn't think it was necessary to--
-To what?

692
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,976
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

693
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,529
My attention was completely focused
on you.

694
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,407
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

695
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,826
...I am prepared to discuss it.

696
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,332
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

697
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:24,961
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

698
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:28,840
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

699
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,594
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

700
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,979
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

701
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,987
He's all yours.

702
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,371
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

703
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,041
No, she won't.

704
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:21,726
He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...

705
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,688
...linchpin of our national security...

706
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:29,401
...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.

707
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,278
Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...

708
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:37,409
...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...

709
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:42,455
...brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.

710
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,596
Who is it?

711
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,724
LAURIE:
It's Laurie.

712
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,863
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

713
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,490
I didn't know where else to go.

714
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,827
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

715
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,294
What's wrong?

716
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,255
I left Jon.

717
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,258
Oh, God.

718
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,469
I'm so sorry.

719
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,472
I don't know why I'm here. I just....

720
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,476
I don't know anybody else.

721
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,605
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

722
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,815
That's okay.

723
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,276
You probably just had an argument
or something.

724
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,819
No, Dan.

725
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,031
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

726
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,326
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

727
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,995
...remember what they are.

728
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,498
It's like this world, this real world...

729
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,460
...to him,
it's like walking through mist.

730
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:14,172
And people are just shadows.

731
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,259
Shadows in a fog.

732
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,722
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

733
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,351
I'm sorry, Dan.

734
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,063
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

735
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,525
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

736
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:37,195
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

737
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,364
You're more than welcome to join.

738
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,868
In fact, I insist.

739
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,154
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

740
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,239
He just--
-We don't have time for makeup.

741
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,700
That blue is too light for television.

742
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,454
Is that dark enough?

743
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,168
Yeah, that's dark enough.

744
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:37,005
The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

745
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,424
News vendors always cope. They're the--

746
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:43,178
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

747
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,431
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

748
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,268
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

749
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,938
Hold up. Here they come.

750
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,236
-Seymour.
-Bernie, how's tricks?

751
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,446
Fine, fine.

752
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,908
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

753
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:11,998
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

754
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,793
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

755
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,642
Girl.
What we got here?

756
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,686
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

757
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,648
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

758
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,192
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

759
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,071
--a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

760
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:48,993
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

761
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:53,456
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

762
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,958
Welcome.

763
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,172
Thank you.

764
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,299
That's right.

765
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,642
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

766
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,227
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

767
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,105
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

768
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,858
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

769
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,195
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

770
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,532
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

771
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,618
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

772
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,371
My father was a watchmaker.

773
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:38,543
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

774
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,713
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

775
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,881
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

776
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:47,302
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

777
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,389
So you're saying there is no danger.

778
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,560
Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.

779
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,401
And would you say, as so many claim...

780
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,320
...that you are, in fact, a god...

781
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,323
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

782
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,783
I can only see my own past...

783
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:15,121
...my own future. I am not omniscient.

784
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,081
Doug Roth, your question?

785
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:20,001
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

786
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,920
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

787
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:28,259
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

788
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,303
He died of cancer.

789
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,431
-He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi...

790
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,517
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?

791
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:41,606
You encountered him several times
in the '60s: battles, conflicts.

792
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,275
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

793
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,444
I wasn't told.

794
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,821
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?

795
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,450
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

796
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:53,868
Cancer.

797
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,704
You're suggesting I was the cause.

798
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:00,124
From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

799
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,293
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

800
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,296
A live human body
and a deceased human body...

801
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,548
...have the same number of particles.

802
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,178
Structurally, there's no difference.

803
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,598
All right. Let's settle down, please.

804
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,688
What about Janey Slater?

805
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,817
You think it makes a difference to her?

806
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,194
Janey?

807
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,113
Your ex-girlfriend?

808
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,908
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

809
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,618
Doug, one question at a time.

810
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:39,163
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

811
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,165
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

812
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,474
You were the world to me, Jon.

813
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,310
You were my whole life.

814
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,856
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

815
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,691
Janey, I wasn't told.

816
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:12,530
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

817
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,245
This is how you repay me?

818
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:24,584
-Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
-Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

819
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,752
Janey, wait.

820
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,590
-That's it. This interview is over.
Get up there.

821
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:33,134
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

822
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,013
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

823
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:43,269
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

824
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,355
...and leave me alone....

825
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,899
Do you care to comment?

826
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,110
I said, leave me alone!

827
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,638
Jesus.

828
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,349
Us...

829
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,101
...getting mugged.

830
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,022
Let's go.

831
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,571
I'm shaking.

832
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,536
You know what?

833
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,414
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

834
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:48,793
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

835
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,212
...and shake off the adrenaline?

836
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:55,132
I think I've had enough hero stuff for one night.

837
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,636
It helped having you listen.

838
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,680
Any time.

839
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,307
Take care, Dan.

840
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,394
It's a rough world out there.

841
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:09,063
Be seeing you.

842
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,737
I thought of my family...

843
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,949
...my wife, my daughters.

844
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,118
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

845
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,247
Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation...

846
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,833
...bearing down upon them.

847
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,424
Hey!

848
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,050
Over here!

849
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,177
Here!

850
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,435
Ridley.

851
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,077
A sail.

852
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:08,039
Ridley had brought me a sail.

853
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:11,459
Perhaps this could be my route
back to Davidstown.

854
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:17,048
Everything I loved, everything I lived for,
depended on my reaching home...

855
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:20,551
...in advance of that terrible Freighter.

856
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,647
The morning sun found me
no less troubled.

857
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,483
Further down the shore...

858
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:39,153
...some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.

859
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,030
Ugh!

860
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:50,206
I shuddered at my own idea,
attempting to banish this repulsive notion.

861
01:17:57,589 --> 01:18:01,926
Even in death,
they sought to fulfill their duty...

862
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,679
...making our vessel more buoyant.

863
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,182
And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.

864
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:15,147
Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest,
and laying them in the bed I prepared...

865
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:19,777
...I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands...

866
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,654
...when their turn came.

867
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,382
We shall get home together, my friend.

868
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,803
I waited for the tide.

869
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:50,641
Then, embarking, headed east.

870
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,811
East, across the night seas.

871
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:58,441
East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.

872
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,861
Hope can be a horrible thing.

873
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:10,930
With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.

874
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,223
Ridley.

875
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,477
Get out.

876
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,945
I was reminded
that I, myself, had not eaten.

877
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:32,034
I know it is unappetizing,
but it is all we have.

878
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,375
He's gone.

879
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,335
-He's gone!
Who's gone?

880
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,587
-Dr. Manhattan.
What? What'd you say?

881
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:47,007
Dr. Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

882
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,718
What? Gone where?

883
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:56,934
You're late.

884
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,229
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

885
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,190
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

886
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,067
Wait, what?

887
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,575
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

888
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,954
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

889
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,874
I said, leave me alone!

890
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,927
I am looking at the stars.

891
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,430
They're so far away...

892
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,516
...and their light takes so long
to reach us...

893
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,481
...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

894
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,906
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

895
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,408
That's great.

896
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,201
-You can pick it up tomorrow.
-Okay.

897
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,120
-Seventy-five cents.
-Okay, thank you.

898
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,330
Thank you.

899
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:03,667
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice.
I'm sure I made a face.

900
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:08,839
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

901
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,095
Her name is Janey Slater.

902
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,599
She is a physicist, like me.

903
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,644
I am 30 years old.

904
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:30,277
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

905
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,034
It is February 12th, 1981.

906
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,955
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

907
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:01,350
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.

908
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:12,194
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

909
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,163
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

910
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,083
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

911
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:33,882
I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

912
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,765
When I get to the door...

913
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,727
...Wally is turning white.

914
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:48,939
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

915
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,276
I am terrified.

916
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,569
Jon?

917
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,576
I'm sorry, Jon...

918
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,079
...but I can't--

919
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,875
Janey, don't leave me!

920
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,419
Don't leave me!

921
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:47,206
It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.

922
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,833
She buys me a beer...

923
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,878
...the first time a woman
has done this for me.

924
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:58,092
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...

925
01:24:58,718 --> 01:24:59,968
...our fingers touch.

926
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:15,025
Yes, Jon, good.

927
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:20,697
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

928
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:25,619
I feel fear...

929
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,997
...for the last time.

930
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,225
A token funeral is held.

931
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,561
There is nothing to bury.

932
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:53,355
Janey frames the snapshot.

933
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,692
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

934
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:02,865
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

935
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,741
A few days later...

936
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:08,120
...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...

937
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:12,124
...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

938
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:39,526
Oh, God.

939
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,236
Jon?

940
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,114
Is that you?

941
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,784
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

942
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:50,621
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

943
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:54,833
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

944
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,800
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

945
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:08,096
They explain the name
has been chosen...

946
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:12,476
...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.

947
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:20,442
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

948
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,620
If I'm to have a symbol...

949
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:36,208
...it shall be one I respect.

950
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,304
They are shaping me
into something gaudy...

951
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,516
...something lethal.

952
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,856
In January, 1971...

953
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:03,986
...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...

954
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:06,905
...something that his predecessors
would not ask.

955
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:11,034
A week later, the conflict ends.

956
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:15,664
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

957
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:22,713
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

958
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,718
In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

959
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,263
I am not sure if I know what that means.

960
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,866
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

961
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:54,202
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

962
01:28:54,370 --> 01:29:00,334
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

963
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,295
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

964
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,382
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

965
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,843
...don't be alarmed.

966
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,514
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

967
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:20,103
It is Christmas, 1963.

968
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:24,149
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

969
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,611
She says I am like a god now.

970
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,447
I tell her I don't think there is a God.

971
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,283
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

972
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,457
I tell her I still want her...

973
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,251
...and that I always will.

974
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:50,967
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

975
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,679
I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

976
01:29:56,140 --> 01:30:00,435
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

977
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,314
She's beautiful.

978
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:13,740
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...

979
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,492
...like a signature.

980
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,996
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

981
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:25,794
She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.

982
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,796
It's true.

983
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,884
She's aging more noticeably every day...

984
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:42,310
...while I am standing still.

985
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,897
I prefer the stillness here.

986
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,984
I am tired of Earth.

987
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,819
These people.

988
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:55,073
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

989
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:21,224
They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...

990
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,270
...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

991
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,398
Perhaps the world is not made.

992
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,401
Perhaps nothing is made.

993
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:35,822
A clock without a craftsman.

994
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,742
It's too late.

995
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,077
Always has been...

996
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:45,165
...always will be too late.

997
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,295
 And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

998
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:51,755
How would I know?

999
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:54,674
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

1000
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,385
Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

1001
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,846
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

1002
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,306
Really?

1003
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,893
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

1004
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,561
None of your fucking business.

1005
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:10,065
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

1006
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,694
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

1007
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:24,329
Smoke?

1008
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:27,123
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

1009
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,627
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

1010
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,463
You can imagine our concern.

1011
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:35,173
I can only imagine.

1012
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:45,433
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

1013
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:48,436
Then Ozymandias here...

1014
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:51,648
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

1015
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,919
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

1016
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,256
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1017
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,384
You're the Comedian, right?

1018
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,052
You were pretty cool in there.

1019
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:25,599
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1020
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:31,104
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

1021
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,481
Take your hands off her.

1022
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,734
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1023
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:39,529
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1024
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:43,074
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1025
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:47,078
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1026
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,497
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1027
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,791
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

1028
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,627
We found him!

1029
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:58,757
-We found him.
Where is he?

1030
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,511
Mars.

1031
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,561
Mr. President...

1032
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:16,358
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

1033
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,152
They are testing us...

1034
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,740
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

1035
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,993
...to coax a move out of them.

1036
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:31,122
 If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

1037
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:35,377
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

1038
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:40,465
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

1039
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,884
...to two minutes until midnight.

1040
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:46,221
Get this shit off the screen.

1041
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:49,432
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

1042
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,060
I say when doomsday is approaching.

1043
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,317
Now, then.

1044
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,862
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

1045
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:07,242
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

1046
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,578
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

1047
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:12,372
Letting the Russians take the lead.

1048
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,921
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

1049
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,841
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

1050
01:35:23,008 --> 01:35:27,303
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

1051
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:35,812
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

1052
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,022
Two days.

1053
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:42,318
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

1054
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:44,529
...before they get their missiles airborne.

1055
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,741
What would our losses be?

1056
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,784
Assuming conservative projections...

1057
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:53,329
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

1058
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:55,331
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

1059
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,333
The last gasp...

1060
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,670
...of the Harvard establishment.

1061
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:04,340
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

1062
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:08,136
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

1063
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,513
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

1064
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:12,766
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

1065
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,642
Not so bad...

1066
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,562
...all things considered.

1067
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,983
Mr. President...

1068
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,777
...what would you like to do?

1069
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,412
Take us to DEFCON two.

1070
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,581
Begin fueling the bombers.

1071
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,084
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

1072
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,337
After that...

1073
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:46,132
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

1074
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:49,719
Let's just hope he's on our side.

1075
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,056
There must be a way to reach him.
Excuse me.

1076
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,891
Radio transmission, space shuttles--

1077
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,267
 Excuse me.
 What?

1078
01:36:56,435 --> 01:36:58,728
I need to use the restroom.

1079
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:21,918
Don't you understand?

1080
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,754
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

1081
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,881
If he wants to find me, he will.

1082
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:29,509
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

1083
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,594
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

1084
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:34,639
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

1085
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:39,227
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

1086
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:41,062
You can understand.

1087
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:46,317
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

1088
01:37:46,485 --> 01:37:48,736
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

1089
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:51,656
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

1090
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:54,742
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

1091
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,870
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

1092
01:37:57,037 --> 01:38:00,290
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

1093
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,585
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...

1094
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:06,963
...I respect your position...

1095
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:11,050
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

1096
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:13,970
You wanna know my past? Hm?

1097
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:17,473
Okay. Happily.

1098
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:21,144
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

1099
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,146
...leaving me alone.

1100
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:27,483
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

1101
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:32,572
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

1102
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,242
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1103
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,829
Well, anyone living, that is.

1104
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,956
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

1105
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:45,251
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1106
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:50,798
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1107
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:54,010
His vision of a united world was....

1108
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,015
Well, it was unprecedented.

1109
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,850
I wanted...

1110
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,353
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

1111
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,689
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1112
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:10,360
And so began my path to conquest.

1113
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:13,780
Conquest not of men...

1114
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:16,783
...but of the evils that beset them.

1115
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:21,913
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1116
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,916
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

1117
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:26,709
-...are the pushers.
-Now, listen.

1118
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:28,920
ADRIAN:
No.

1119
01:39:31,256 --> 01:39:33,049
You listen.

1120
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:36,803
The world will survive...

1121
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:40,431
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1122
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:43,226
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1123
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,937
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

1124
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:49,732
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

1125
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:56,197
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

1126
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,076
I think you know the way out.

1127
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,579
Gentlemen.

1128
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,585
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1129
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:13,214
-Seems all the old villains are dead.
-Mr. Veidt?

1130
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:16,926
-I think I have some ideas.
-Mr. Veidt?

1131
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,929
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1132
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,636
He's got a poison capsule.

1133
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,767
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

1134
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,018
Give me a name!

1135
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,448
Suicide pill.

1136
01:41:21,533 --> 01:41:24,494
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1137
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:26,496
Thanks, hon.

1138
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,998
Then Rorschach was right.

1139
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,334
This wasn't some lone nut.

1140
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:35,671
It's an organization:
well-funded, well-equipped.

1141
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,549
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1142
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:43,012
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1143
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,520
So no word from Jon?

1144
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,106
No.

1145
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:55,358
Well, listen...

1146
01:41:55,859 --> 01:41:57,568
...why don't you come stay with me?

1147
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,906
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1148
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:05,743
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

1149
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:09,914
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

1150
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:14,544
Okay.

1151
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:23,052
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.

1152
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:27,348
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

1153
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:30,685
They didn't know me without my mask.

1154
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,187
An affair?

1155
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:36,232
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...

1156
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,402
...to make room for Dreiberg?

1157
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:43,030
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

1158
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:47,076
The alley was cold, deserted.

1159
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:51,831
My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.

1160
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:56,377
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

1161
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:59,839
My face.

1162
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:04,010
Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise...

1163
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,304
...became myself.

1164
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:09,932
Free from fear or weakness...

1165
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,184
...or lust.

1166
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:14,604
Down alley...

1167
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,647
...heard woman scream.

1168
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:20,818
First bubbling note
of city's evening chorus.

1169
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,778
Attempted rape.

1170
01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:24,113
Mugging.

1171
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,781
Both.

1172
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:28,951
The man turned...

1173
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,288
...and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.

1174
01:43:33,248 --> 01:43:35,708
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

1175
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:46,135
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.

1176
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,472
At his apartment, I found clues.

1177
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:53,768
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.

1178
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,479
I've seen the logo before...

1179
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:58,981
...at Moloch's.

1180
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:32,265
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

1181
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,893
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

1182
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,187
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

1183
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:42,316
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

1184
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:45,987
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

1185
01:44:46,154 --> 01:44:49,740
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

1186
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,247
Rorschach.

1187
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,791
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

1188
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:00,835
No. No!

1189
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:04,130
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

1190
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:07,216
No. No, no, no!

1191
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:11,804
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1192
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,597
Never, never surrender.

1193
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,767
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

1194
01:45:16,935 --> 01:45:17,977
When you are.

1195
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:41,709
One...

1196
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:47,757
...two...

1197
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,845
...three.

1198
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,607
Come on.

1199
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:58,828
Son of a bitch.

1200
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,206
-Christ, he stinks.
-Get that mask off him.

1201
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:05,209
-I got it.
-No. No!

1202
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,087
My face! Give me back my face!

1203
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:11,549
The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...

1204
01:47:11,716 --> 01:47:15,553
...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

1205
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,806
Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...

1206
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:22,810
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.

1207
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,021
Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...

1208
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:28,732
...during the violent course
of the capture.

1209
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:33,863
Rorschach!

1210
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:37,741
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1211
01:47:44,374 --> 01:47:47,334
Come on out, Rorschach!

1212
01:47:50,213 --> 01:47:52,882
I knew this guy was a kook.

1213
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,842
But Rorschach....

1214
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,761
Usually I got an intuition
about these kind of things.

1215
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:00,347
-Thought the dude would be bigger.
-It goes to show you, kid...

1216
01:48:00,515 --> 01:48:02,349
-...you never know.
-Hey, let me get a Gazette.

1217
01:48:02,517 --> 01:48:06,353
Yeah. Hey, you see this?
He was a customer of mine.

1218
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:09,482
-Used to come here all the time.
-No shit?

1219
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:14,069
Hey, Bernie. Any good news?

1220
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:27,249
Whoever we are, wherever we reside...

1221
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:30,252
...we exist on the whim of murderers.

1222
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:37,885
I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.

1223
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:41,180
I could not bring myself to tell him
he was a horrible reflection...

1224
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,265
...of his former self.

1225
01:48:43,558 --> 01:48:48,103
I really must get him home before....
Before he gets any worse.

1226
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:50,397
Before he succumbs.

1227
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:56,362
I've heard that on less than a pint daily,
a man might survive drinking saltwater.

1228
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,863
RIDLEY:
Captain?

1229
01:48:58,031 --> 01:48:59,490
What are you doing, captain?

1230
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:04,870
I'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

1231
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,040
I need to warn everyone.

1232
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:14,046
You think you'll reach Davidstown
in advance of the Black Freighter?

1233
01:49:14,422 --> 01:49:18,592
Isolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

1234
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:20,928
But we must try.

1235
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:22,304
You are a fool.

1236
01:49:22,472 --> 01:49:24,974
You alone survived the Freighter's attack.

1237
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:29,353
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

1238
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:34,900
Turn your wretched craft around
and go far away, as far away as you can.

1239
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:40,948
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

1240
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,993
The Black Freighter is already there.

1241
01:49:44,786 --> 01:49:46,412
Your wife, dead.

1242
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,206
-Your children, dead.
-Shut your mouth.

1243
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:53,711
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

1244
01:50:15,066 --> 01:50:18,527
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

1245
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,904
I give my life in nobility.

1246
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:26,869
Even if I fail in my attempt,
I take solace in the fact that I will see...

1247
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,579
...my family again in heaven.

1248
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:30,080
Heaven?

1249
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:32,333
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

1250
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,960
Believe me, sir.

1251
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,296
I would know by now.

1252
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:45,679
Walter Kovacs.

1253
01:50:45,847 --> 01:50:48,557
Is that your name? Walter?

1254
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:52,770
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1255
01:50:52,937 --> 01:50:54,521
You cooperate with me...

1256
01:50:54,689 --> 01:50:59,193
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1257
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:02,905
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

1258
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:09,119
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

1259
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:13,082
-Prison's a prison.
-Uh-huh. Yes.

1260
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,086
But the difference is, down there...

1261
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,046
...you'd be eaten alive.

1262
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:24,259
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1263
01:51:27,305 --> 01:51:28,764
Tell me what you see.

1264
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,604
A pretty butterfly.

1265
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:41,276
What about now? What do you see here?

1266
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:47,449
Mom?

1267
01:51:47,784 --> 01:51:49,159
Is he hurting you?

1268
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:52,204
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

1269
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:55,916
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1270
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,469
Some nice flowers.

1271
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:14,852
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

1272
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:19,898
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1273
01:52:20,066 --> 01:52:24,862
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1274
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,408
 Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1275
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:49,178
Clouds.

1276
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,852
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1277
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:00,522
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1278
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:05,819
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

1279
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:07,362
You're fat.

1280
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:11,074
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1281
01:53:11,242 --> 01:53:13,243
What you call compassion.

1282
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:15,704
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1283
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:19,792
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1284
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:21,418
Nothing short of compromise.

1285
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:24,171
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1286
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:28,550
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1287
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:32,221
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1288
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:35,307
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1289
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,560
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1290
01:53:39,854 --> 01:53:42,356
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

1291
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:45,150
...he can never turn his back on it.

1292
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:47,903
Never pretend, like you do...

1293
01:53:48,196 --> 01:53:52,407
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

1294
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:56,245
We don't do this thing...

1295
01:53:56,412 --> 01:53:58,539
...because it's permitted.

1296
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,750
We do it because we have to.

1297
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:04,753
We do it because we're compelled.

1298
01:54:06,589 --> 01:54:09,007
I was investigating a kidnap case.

1299
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,594
Blaire Roche.

1300
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:16,223
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

1301
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,434
Too soft on criminals.

1302
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:21,979
I let them live.

1303
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:28,986
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.

1304
01:54:36,619 --> 01:54:39,037
I knew the girl was here...

1305
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:42,749
...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.

1306
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:46,044
And then I found her.

1307
01:55:35,386 --> 01:55:37,262
Fred.

1308
01:55:38,139 --> 01:55:39,973
Barney.

1309
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:42,851
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1310
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:51,568
It was dark when the murderer got back.

1311
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:54,905
As dark as it gets.

1312
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:38,407
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

1313
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,368
Who is it?

1314
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:55,507
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1315
01:56:55,675 --> 01:57:00,178
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1316
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:09,730
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1317
01:57:09,897 --> 01:57:12,357
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1318
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,076
Okay. I confess.

1319
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,955
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1320
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:29,124
Arrest me.

1321
01:57:29,959 --> 01:57:31,668
What? Arrest me!

1322
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,255
I did it! I said I did it!

1323
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:36,840
Christ.

1324
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:41,303
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1325
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:48,852
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

1326
01:57:53,816 --> 01:57:57,319
Men get arrested.

1327
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,781
Dogs get put down.

1328
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:11,041
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1329
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,795
Warm blood splashed my face.

1330
01:58:16,005 --> 01:58:20,133
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1331
01:58:21,135 --> 01:58:23,345
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1332
01:58:24,889 --> 01:58:27,682
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1333
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:32,312
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1334
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:36,900
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1335
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,654
From then on, I knew:

1336
01:58:41,989 --> 01:58:44,324
God doesn't make the world this way.

1337
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:47,828
We do.

1338
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:56,545
I can't help him.

1339
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,433
Hey, Rorschach.

1340
01:59:11,435 --> 01:59:13,436
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1341
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,064
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1342
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:19,818
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1343
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:22,529
-Ain't that right? That's right.
That's right.

1344
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,409
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1345
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:46,178
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

1346
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:48,430
All right, that's it!

1347
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:51,725
You're locked in here with me.

1348
02:01:10,471 --> 02:01:11,513
Laurie!

1349
02:01:12,723 --> 02:01:14,057
Shit.

1350
02:01:15,059 --> 02:01:16,977
Hold on.
-Fuck.

1351
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:21,731
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1352
02:01:26,404 --> 02:01:29,823
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1353
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:31,408
-Are you hurt?
-No, no.

1354
02:01:31,575 --> 02:01:34,703
-Okay.
-I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1355
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:36,871
No, don't worry.

1356
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:40,333
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1357
02:01:41,419 --> 02:01:43,253
Archie survived that.

1358
02:01:43,713 --> 02:01:45,046
Archie?

1359
02:01:45,756 --> 02:01:49,217
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1360
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:50,927
...Merlin's pet owl.

1361
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:53,722
Stupid nickname.

1362
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,517
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1363
02:01:57,685 --> 02:02:03,231
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1364
02:02:03,941 --> 02:02:07,277
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was....

1365
02:02:07,945 --> 02:02:10,572
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

1366
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,449
...instead of following him.

1367
02:02:13,242 --> 02:02:20,248
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and....

1368
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:24,669
Plus, there were enough other guys
doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1369
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:26,796
Like Hollis.

1370
02:02:26,964 --> 02:02:28,465
Yeah.

1371
02:02:29,258 --> 02:02:32,010
Yeah, he was my hero.

1372
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:36,431
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

1373
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:40,268
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1374
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,771
To something that mattered.

1375
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:48,276
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1376
02:02:48,944 --> 02:02:51,112
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1377
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:56,284
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1378
02:02:57,745 --> 02:03:00,080
Nobody watching you.

1379
02:03:03,417 --> 02:03:04,459
Wanna try those on?

1380
02:03:15,262 --> 02:03:16,930
There we go.

1381
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:22,102
Wow, these rock.

1382
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:27,232
They amplify the spectral range.

1383
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,526
Thermal imaging.

1384
02:03:31,195 --> 02:03:33,196
They work even better in the dark.

1385
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:39,869
You can see me, right?

1386
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:44,707
I can see everything.

1387
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:50,964
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1388
02:03:51,298 --> 02:03:55,427
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1389
02:03:57,721 --> 02:04:00,056
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1390
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,395
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1391
02:04:05,646 --> 02:04:07,730
Put those away when you're done.

1392
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:19,033
Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. had no comment...

1393
02:04:19,201 --> 02:04:21,494
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...

1394
02:04:21,662 --> 02:04:23,997
...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.

1395
02:04:24,165 --> 02:04:25,874
Dan.

1396
02:04:26,584 --> 02:04:28,334
Jon sees a lot of things...

1397
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:33,047
...but he doesn't see me.

1398
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:41,723
Well, uh....

1399
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:01,493
Oh.

1400
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:36,653
Sorry.

1401
02:05:38,656 --> 02:05:39,989
Come here.

1402
02:05:45,955 --> 02:05:47,205
What's the matter?

1403
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:49,791
-If you could just move a little....
-Okay.

1404
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:52,210
Yeah. There you go.

1405
02:05:58,717 --> 02:06:01,344
Dan, what's wrong?

1406
02:06:03,013 --> 02:06:04,138
Sorry, I....

1407
02:06:06,308 --> 02:06:08,518
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1408
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:12,647
Oh, hell.

1409
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,234
It's okay.

1410
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:22,073
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1411
02:06:25,661 --> 02:06:28,288
We've got all the time in the world.

1412
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,791
We'll take it slow.

1413
02:06:45,764 --> 02:06:48,099
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1414
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:50,268
Big Figure.

1415
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:52,437
Small world.

1416
02:06:53,772 --> 02:06:55,273
I like that.

1417
02:06:56,025 --> 02:06:58,443
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1418
02:06:58,861 --> 02:07:01,654
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1419
02:07:01,822 --> 02:07:03,948
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1420
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:05,617
That's right.

1421
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:10,121
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1422
02:07:13,125 --> 02:07:14,292
So...

1423
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:19,547
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1424
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:24,927
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1425
02:07:25,095 --> 02:07:29,432
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1426
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:32,894
This place is gonna explode!

1427
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,148
Then, you die by inches.

1428
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,734
Tall order.

1429
02:07:39,985 --> 02:07:42,487
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1430
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:46,157
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1431
02:07:46,992 --> 02:07:48,326
Come on.

1432
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:24,297
Know this, my friends.

1433
02:09:24,465 --> 02:09:25,548
Hades is wet.

1434
02:09:26,884 --> 02:09:28,468
Hades is lonely.

1435
02:09:44,318 --> 02:09:48,070
And in that instant, we knew each other.

1436
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:26,734
I'm sorry, my friend.

1437
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:49,882
My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque...

1438
02:10:50,467 --> 02:10:53,511
...reflecting my own transformation.

1439
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:11,153
Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked...

1440
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:14,448
...spilling from brain to heart
like black ink...

1441
02:11:14,616 --> 02:11:17,076
...impossible to remove.

1442
02:11:25,919 --> 02:11:28,921
The vessel had surely reached
Davidstown already.

1443
02:11:29,756 --> 02:11:34,135
I pictured quiet streets overrun
by the fiends from the Black Freighter.

1444
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:37,555
My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.

1445
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:39,724
My crew, dead.

1446
02:11:39,892 --> 02:11:43,561
The beast I ride on, dead.

1447
02:11:52,487 --> 02:11:55,448
More blood, more blood, more blood.

1448
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:11,088
Father?

1449
02:12:11,256 --> 02:12:13,716
It can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

1450
02:12:13,884 --> 02:12:17,136
Father, help us. Please.

1451
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:18,346
Wait.

1452
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:21,057
I'm coming.

1453
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:23,184
Hurry, my dear.

1454
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:26,854
Wait. Anyone but them.

1455
02:12:27,022 --> 02:12:28,648
Anyone.

1456
02:12:28,899 --> 02:12:30,483
Anyone.

1457
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:36,989
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

1458
02:12:37,157 --> 02:12:39,992
I'd swallowed too much horror.

1459
02:12:43,455 --> 02:12:44,705
God has damned me.

1460
02:12:45,874 --> 02:12:48,501
God has damned us all.

1461
02:12:48,669 --> 02:12:54,590
Truly, life is hell, and death's rough hand
our only deliverance.

1462
02:12:55,342 --> 02:12:57,468
I can endure no more.

1463
02:12:57,636 --> 02:13:01,555
I want to join my family desperately.

1464
02:13:09,356 --> 02:13:11,190
Yo, man.

1465
02:13:11,733 --> 02:13:13,567
What you reading?

1466
02:13:14,736 --> 02:13:16,237
Nothing, man.

1467
02:13:17,614 --> 02:13:20,199
-Nothing, huh?
-Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

1468
02:13:20,367 --> 02:13:22,076
Shut up, old man!

1469
02:13:30,877 --> 02:13:33,587
You're reading a comic book?
What are you, retarded?

1470
02:13:40,887 --> 02:13:43,931
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

1471
02:13:54,192 --> 02:13:55,526
Dan?

1472
02:14:02,367 --> 02:14:04,035
Is everything all right?

1473
02:14:06,371 --> 02:14:09,290
I'm tired of being afraid.

1474
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:12,752
Afraid of war...

1475
02:14:13,545 --> 02:14:17,131
...afraid of the mask killer...

1476
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:21,927
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1477
02:14:22,095 --> 02:14:24,055
...and how much I need it.

1478
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:26,557
Me too.

1479
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,351
So to hell with it.

1480
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:31,562
Let's take Archie out.

1481
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:38,652
You're serious.

1482
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:41,322
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1483
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:44,742
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1484
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:48,556
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1485
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:51,308
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.

1486
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:52,810
Let's go.

1487
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:59,942
I can see it.
All right, hold on.

1488
02:16:10,787 --> 02:16:12,246
Dan, there are kids in there.

1489
02:16:12,414 --> 02:16:14,582
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1490
02:16:14,749 --> 02:16:16,917
We're gonna get you out of there.

1491
02:16:17,085 --> 02:16:19,253
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1492
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,921
I'm gonna get you close.

1493
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:21,023
Let's go.

1494
02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:22,358
Come on.

1495
02:17:22,525 --> 02:17:24,151
All right, let's move it, people.

1496
02:17:30,867 --> 02:17:35,663
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

1497
02:17:36,122 --> 02:17:38,332
Is that Jesus?

1498
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,334
No, baby.

1499
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:43,379
Watch your step.
 All right.

1500
02:17:45,715 --> 02:17:46,757
We're all set.

1501
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:49,468
Is that everyone?

1502
02:18:13,535 --> 02:18:15,828
Bye.
Bye!

1503
02:18:19,416 --> 02:18:21,000
I can't believe we did that.

1504
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:25,421
-They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
-Who cares?

1505
02:18:25,588 --> 02:18:27,548
World War III could start tomorrow.

1506
02:18:29,676 --> 02:18:31,010
Right?

1507
02:18:32,679 --> 02:18:34,013
Right.

1508
02:20:59,117 --> 02:21:01,034
Come back here!

1509
02:21:03,621 --> 02:21:05,330
He's dead, Rorschach.

1510
02:21:05,498 --> 02:21:09,710
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1511
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:12,045
Something from the machine shop.

1512
02:21:13,673 --> 02:21:15,299
Hey, boss, you notice?

1513
02:21:15,467 --> 02:21:18,510
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1514
02:21:18,678 --> 02:21:21,889
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1515
02:21:22,348 --> 02:21:23,474
Fat chance.

1516
02:21:24,184 --> 02:21:25,309
You're dead, Rorschach!

1517
02:21:25,477 --> 02:21:29,146
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1518
02:21:32,066 --> 02:21:34,526
Your hands, my pleasure.

1519
02:21:36,529 --> 02:21:38,530
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1520
02:21:38,698 --> 02:21:41,992
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

1521
02:21:43,119 --> 02:21:46,497
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1522
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:51,919
Nothing personal, big guy.

1523
02:21:53,379 --> 02:21:55,380
Boss! Wait!

1524
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:11,313
Now you find out what the score is.

1525
02:22:11,773 --> 02:22:14,900
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1526
02:22:20,949 --> 02:22:22,616
Come on.

1527
02:22:22,784 --> 02:22:24,409
So I've been thinking.

1528
02:22:25,328 --> 02:22:29,498
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1529
02:22:30,333 --> 02:22:33,418
-I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
What?

1530
02:22:33,586 --> 02:22:35,337
Someone set him up.

1531
02:22:36,172 --> 02:22:39,800
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1532
02:22:39,968 --> 02:22:41,885
You didn't get it.

1533
02:22:42,178 --> 02:22:44,638
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1534
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:48,475
-...is a little different than putting out a fire.
-Yeah, you're right.

1535
02:22:49,352 --> 02:22:51,186
It'll be more fun.

1536
02:22:55,358 --> 02:22:58,360
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1537
02:23:03,658 --> 02:23:05,367
Yes.

1538
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:11,164
No.

1539
02:23:25,054 --> 02:23:29,891
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1540
02:23:30,727 --> 02:23:34,021
Two-nothing. Your move.

1541
02:23:37,358 --> 02:23:39,026
Get out of the way!

1542
02:24:05,928 --> 02:24:07,804
How do we know he's still alive?

1543
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:11,266
He's alive.

1544
02:24:23,029 --> 02:24:24,571
No. No.

1545
02:24:25,239 --> 02:24:26,615
Where's my face?

1546
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,911
Don't kill me.

1547
02:24:34,582 --> 02:24:35,957
Your turn, doctor.

1548
02:24:36,125 --> 02:24:39,336
Tell me, what do you see?

1549
02:26:05,506 --> 02:26:07,215
Don't move!

1550
02:26:15,516 --> 02:26:17,267
Rorschach.

1551
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:20,562
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1552
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:24,149
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1553
02:26:24,692 --> 02:26:26,651
Oh, for chrissake.

1554
02:27:03,856 --> 02:27:05,982
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1555
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:09,569
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1556
02:27:09,737 --> 02:27:13,990
You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
-Spare me indignation.

1557
02:27:15,243 --> 02:27:18,245
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1558
02:27:18,412 --> 02:27:21,248
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1559
02:27:21,415 --> 02:27:24,084
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

1560
02:27:24,252 --> 02:27:28,088
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1561
02:27:28,256 --> 02:27:32,008
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1562
02:27:36,013 --> 02:27:38,390
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1563
02:28:17,263 --> 02:28:19,389
Are you all right?

1564
02:28:20,808 --> 02:28:23,018
Yeah. Just...

1565
02:28:23,477 --> 02:28:24,728
...heavy, you know?

1566
02:28:25,521 --> 02:28:27,647
War, jailbreak.

1567
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:33,028
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1568
02:28:38,034 --> 02:28:41,077
-Hello, Laurie.
-Jon.

1569
02:28:41,245 --> 02:28:44,873
-TV said you were on Mars.
-I am on Mars.

1570
02:28:45,458 --> 02:28:47,834
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1571
02:28:48,002 --> 02:28:49,502
What are you talking about?

1572
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:52,339
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1573
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:01,222
-Laurie, don't.
-Dan, trust me.

1574
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:03,058
I have to go.

1575
02:29:08,731 --> 02:29:10,732
Beautiful, isn't it?

1576
02:29:15,571 --> 02:29:18,531
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1577
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:21,743
It won't happen again.

1578
02:29:23,412 --> 02:29:25,413
That's comforting.

1579
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:29,417
Oh, my God.

1580
02:29:30,086 --> 02:29:31,920
I'm on Mars.

1581
02:29:35,925 --> 02:29:39,803
Hey. Nice ass.
 Hey, asshole.

1582
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:42,555
Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1583
02:29:43,391 --> 02:29:45,308
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1584
02:29:45,476 --> 02:29:50,188
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1585
02:29:50,356 --> 02:29:52,065
-Rorschach?
-Yeah.

1586
02:29:52,233 --> 02:29:54,109
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1587
02:29:54,276 --> 02:29:57,153
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1588
02:29:57,321 --> 02:29:59,990
-Yeah.
-Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1589
02:30:00,157 --> 02:30:02,409
-Didn't he write a book or something?
-Yeah.

1590
02:30:02,576 --> 02:30:06,413
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1591
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:09,249
-Yeah?
-Does he, now?

1592
02:30:12,003 --> 02:30:13,169
Hello?

1593
02:30:14,171 --> 02:30:16,172

Sally?

1594
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:19,259
-Hollis?
-Yeah.

1595
02:30:19,510 --> 02:30:23,430
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1596
02:30:24,223 --> 02:30:28,852
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1597
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:31,813
Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

1598
02:30:31,981 --> 02:30:33,106
What?

1599
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:37,527
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1600
02:30:38,404 --> 02:30:41,197
There were trapped people
rescued by airship...

1601
02:30:41,365 --> 02:30:46,953
...and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.

1602
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:49,289
And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.

1603
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:52,083
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1604
02:30:53,669 --> 02:30:56,796
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1605
02:30:56,964 --> 02:31:00,467
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

1606
02:31:00,634 --> 02:31:04,220
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

1607
02:31:04,388 --> 02:31:06,139
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1608
02:31:06,307 --> 02:31:08,600
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.

1609
02:31:09,268 --> 02:31:11,311
But that's probably just senility.

1610
02:31:14,065 --> 02:31:16,983
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1611
02:31:17,151 --> 02:31:19,527
...but someone's knocking.

1612
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:25,075
Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1613
02:31:25,951 --> 02:31:27,786
You take care now, Hollis.

1614
02:31:27,953 --> 02:31:29,245
Ah, you too.

1615
02:31:29,413 --> 02:31:30,663
Bye.

1616
02:31:31,207 --> 02:31:32,707
Bye.

1617
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:38,463
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1618
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:41,508
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1619
02:31:41,675 --> 02:31:43,259
Mr. Owl, you there?

1620
02:31:43,844 --> 02:31:45,220
Trick or treat.

1621
02:31:46,847 --> 02:31:48,431
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1622
02:32:53,664 --> 02:32:55,248
I hate this.

1623
02:32:55,416 --> 02:32:59,627
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1624
02:32:59,879 --> 02:33:03,089
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1625
02:33:03,257 --> 02:33:05,717
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1626
02:33:05,885 --> 02:33:08,136
And what would that be?

1627
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:12,182
Once we've established a pattern...

1628
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:14,726
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

1629
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:17,312
Did that. Dead end.

1630
02:33:17,479 --> 02:33:22,108
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

1631
02:33:25,029 --> 02:33:29,365
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1632
02:33:29,533 --> 02:33:32,285
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1633
02:33:32,453 --> 02:33:34,579
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1634
02:33:34,747 --> 02:33:39,209
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1635
02:33:39,376 --> 02:33:41,461
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1636
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:43,671
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1637
02:33:43,839 --> 02:33:45,965
You live off people
while insulting them...

1638
02:33:46,133 --> 02:33:49,928
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1639
02:34:01,899 --> 02:34:03,733
I'm sorry.

1640
02:34:06,403 --> 02:34:08,571
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1641
02:34:10,574 --> 02:34:11,908
Daniel...

1642
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:15,870
...you are a good friend.

1643
02:34:18,749 --> 02:34:21,918
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1644
02:34:28,425 --> 02:34:29,926
Forget it.

1645
02:34:31,095 --> 02:34:32,762
It's okay, man.

1646
02:34:34,014 --> 02:34:35,640
Let's do it your way.

1647
02:34:54,702 --> 02:34:55,994
Oh, God.

1648
02:34:56,161 --> 02:35:00,540
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1649
02:35:08,007 --> 02:35:09,507
Oh, you bastards.

1650
02:35:09,675 --> 02:35:12,760
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1651
02:35:13,971 --> 02:35:17,265
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1652
02:35:18,976 --> 02:35:21,894
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1653
02:35:24,023 --> 02:35:26,190
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1654
02:35:26,358 --> 02:35:30,862
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1655
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,697
No.

1656
02:35:34,074 --> 02:35:35,325
Yeah, yeah!

1657
02:35:35,492 --> 02:35:38,411
-I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
-You're a felon.

1658
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:41,581
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1659
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:45,460
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1660
02:35:45,627 --> 02:35:49,255
-Told by whom?
-My contact, Miss Slater.

1661
02:35:49,423 --> 02:35:52,008
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1662
02:35:52,176 --> 02:35:56,137
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1663
02:35:56,305 --> 02:36:00,016
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1664
02:36:04,146 --> 02:36:07,398
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1665
02:36:07,566 --> 02:36:10,276
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1666
02:36:10,444 --> 02:36:11,486
Follow the money.

1667
02:36:11,653 --> 02:36:14,947
 --former member of the
Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...

1668
02:36:15,115 --> 02:36:17,450
...in his apartment less than
an hour ago.

1669
02:36:17,618 --> 02:36:21,704
Witnesses reported seeing members
of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...

1670
02:36:21,872 --> 02:36:25,124
...leaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.

1671
02:36:25,292 --> 02:36:28,252
Reporting live, Tiffany Burns....

1672
02:36:30,589 --> 02:36:33,591
-Who did it?
-I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1673
02:36:33,759 --> 02:36:35,885
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing--

1674
02:36:36,053 --> 02:36:39,138
-Tell me who did it!
-A lot of people dress like this.

1675
02:36:40,474 --> 02:36:42,350
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1676
02:36:48,023 --> 02:36:50,316
You tell your friends they're dead.

1677
02:36:50,484 --> 02:36:54,028
I'm gonna take out this entire
rat hole neighborhood.

1678
02:36:54,196 --> 02:36:56,697
I'll break your neck!

1679
02:36:57,282 --> 02:37:00,284
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1680
02:37:00,869 --> 02:37:03,663
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1681
02:37:13,715 --> 02:37:16,884
This is where we hold our conversation.

1682
02:37:17,511 --> 02:37:21,389
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1683
02:37:22,558 --> 02:37:25,935
-You know about me and Dan?
-Not yet.

1684
02:37:26,228 --> 02:37:29,063
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1685
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:36,446
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

1686
02:37:36,613 --> 02:37:38,823
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1687
02:37:38,991 --> 02:37:42,618
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

1688
02:37:43,787 --> 02:37:46,038
I have no choice.

1689
02:37:47,374 --> 02:37:50,293
Everything is preordained.

1690
02:37:50,461 --> 02:37:52,795
Even my responses.

1691
02:37:53,755 --> 02:37:57,383
And you're just going through
the motions.

1692
02:37:57,551 --> 02:38:00,928
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

1693
02:38:04,057 --> 02:38:06,726
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1694
02:38:07,686 --> 02:38:10,188
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1695
02:38:10,355 --> 02:38:12,064
And what if you're wrong?

1696
02:38:12,232 --> 02:38:16,736
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1697
02:38:16,904 --> 02:38:18,779
Because it's inhuman.

1698
02:38:18,947 --> 02:38:21,365
Because it makes me insane.

1699
02:38:21,533 --> 02:38:25,411
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1700
02:38:32,836 --> 02:38:35,338
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1701
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:39,592
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1702
02:38:40,135 --> 02:38:42,178
You slept with Dan?

1703
02:38:43,889 --> 02:38:46,891
You just said that you already
knew about that.

1704
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:51,604
I said often...

1705
02:38:52,272 --> 02:38:56,609
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1706
02:38:59,029 --> 02:39:00,530
Why would I save a world...

1707
02:39:00,697 --> 02:39:02,823
...I no longer have any stake in?

1708
02:39:04,952 --> 02:39:06,994
Then do it for me.

1709
02:39:07,871 --> 02:39:09,288
If you really care.

1710
02:39:09,456 --> 02:39:12,875
When you left me, I left Earth.

1711
02:39:13,043 --> 02:39:15,962
Does that not show you that I care?

1712
02:39:19,132 --> 02:39:22,093
My red world here, now...

1713
02:39:23,095 --> 02:39:25,972
...means more to me than your blue one.

1714
02:39:26,765 --> 02:39:28,474
Let me show you.

1715
02:39:46,618 --> 02:39:49,537
Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

1716
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:01,132
It's time, gentlemen.

1717
02:40:03,218 --> 02:40:05,636
Take us to DEFCON one.

1718
02:40:12,894 --> 02:40:16,022
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1719
02:40:16,189 --> 02:40:19,066
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1720
02:40:19,234 --> 02:40:21,027
...out into the night at this hour?

1721
02:40:23,071 --> 02:40:24,947
Daniel?

1722
02:40:26,199 --> 02:40:27,950
You with me?

1723
02:40:28,744 --> 02:40:31,871
-Yeah.
-Then what are you doing?

1724
02:40:33,999 --> 02:40:35,750
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1725
02:40:35,917 --> 02:40:38,711
Maybe he keeps on file.

1726
02:40:43,216 --> 02:40:45,676
-Something's not right.
-Agreed.

1727
02:40:45,844 --> 02:40:50,598
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1728
02:40:50,766 --> 02:40:55,394
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1729
02:40:55,562 --> 02:40:58,898
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1730
02:40:59,066 --> 02:41:01,525
Setting Manhattan up.

1731
02:41:15,666 --> 02:41:16,832
Funny.

1732
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:20,503
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1733
02:41:20,671 --> 02:41:25,716
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1734
02:41:26,343 --> 02:41:28,969
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1735
02:41:29,137 --> 02:41:30,388
Pharaohs?

1736
02:41:37,270 --> 02:41:39,271
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1737
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:42,400
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1738
02:41:44,444 --> 02:41:46,946
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1739
02:41:49,282 --> 02:41:52,326
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1740
02:41:52,953 --> 02:41:56,914
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1741
02:42:01,002 --> 02:42:02,795
I'm in.

1742
02:42:31,658 --> 02:42:32,992
No.

1743
02:42:35,162 --> 02:42:40,916
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1744
02:42:41,084 --> 02:42:44,962
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1745
02:42:45,130 --> 02:42:47,423
...is what has led to this triumph.

1746
02:42:47,591 --> 02:42:51,635
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1747
02:42:51,803 --> 02:42:54,221
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1748
02:42:55,015 --> 02:42:59,143
  What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1749
02:43:00,061 --> 02:43:04,190
This is the new Karnak.

1750
02:43:04,357 --> 02:43:07,943
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1751
02:43:08,111 --> 02:43:14,366
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1752
02:43:16,536 --> 02:43:18,204
And for this...

1753
02:43:19,039 --> 02:43:21,373
...I am ashamed...

1754
02:43:22,542 --> 02:43:26,879
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1755
02:43:28,548 --> 02:43:30,549
To the pharaohs...

1756
02:43:31,468 --> 02:43:34,470
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1757
02:43:35,096 --> 02:43:39,433
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1758
02:43:40,310 --> 02:43:42,728
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1759
02:43:43,396 --> 02:43:46,732
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1760
02:43:47,067 --> 02:43:49,610
...to your great sacrifice.

1761
02:43:50,570 --> 02:43:52,738
Bubastis.

1762
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:59,912
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

1763
02:44:00,247 --> 02:44:02,748
Veidt's behind everything.

1764
02:44:02,916 --> 02:44:04,542
Why?

1765
02:44:04,709 --> 02:44:06,752
What's his endgame?

1766
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:10,589
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

1767
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:14,260
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

1768
02:44:14,427 --> 02:44:17,304
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

1769
02:44:17,472 --> 02:44:21,183
That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.

1770
02:44:21,351 --> 02:44:24,103
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading...

1771
02:44:24,271 --> 02:44:28,566
...I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.

1772
02:44:28,733 --> 02:44:31,277
I live my life free of compromise...

1773
02:44:31,444 --> 02:44:35,406
...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

1774
02:44:36,032 --> 02:44:39,034
Rorschach, November 1st.

1775
02:44:44,791 --> 02:44:47,209
Oh, God help us.

1776
02:44:50,297 --> 02:44:52,715
-It's a little early for you, huh?
-Yeah.

1777
02:44:52,883 --> 02:44:55,134
I wanted to finish
the story before school.

1778
02:45:00,599 --> 02:45:04,059
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

1779
02:45:05,186 --> 02:45:07,813
-Huh?
-It's yours.

1780
02:45:07,981 --> 02:45:10,900
I mean, life's too short, right?

1781
02:45:11,151 --> 02:45:12,484
Yeah.

1782
02:45:12,819 --> 02:45:14,153
Uh....

1783
02:45:14,321 --> 02:45:15,905
Thanks, man.

1784
02:45:41,348 --> 02:45:43,682
Why does death pass me by?

1785
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:48,437
Davidstown?

1786
02:45:49,689 --> 02:45:51,398
Davidstown.

1787
02:45:51,691 --> 02:45:54,109
I was only miles away.

1788
02:45:54,277 --> 02:45:56,028
By now the town was overrun.

1789
02:45:56,571 --> 02:45:59,615
The fiends imagined themselves
safe from me.

1790
02:45:59,783 --> 02:46:01,158
But now I was home.

1791
02:46:01,326 --> 02:46:03,702
And revenge would be mine.

1792
02:46:11,378 --> 02:46:14,088
No, not the brigands
from the Black Freighter.

1793
02:46:14,255 --> 02:46:17,383
The man I recognized,
a moneylender from Davidstown.

1794
02:46:17,759 --> 02:46:19,885
With Davidstown certainly captured...

1795
02:46:20,053 --> 02:46:23,222
...why would this scoundrel
and his wench be allowed free passage...

1796
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:24,640
...for this midnight tryst?

1797
02:46:24,808 --> 02:46:26,058
Had he collaborated?

1798
02:46:26,226 --> 02:46:27,643
Had he betrayed my people?

1799
02:46:28,061 --> 02:46:30,813
-My family?
Come and get it, babe.

1800
02:46:31,272 --> 02:46:32,481
Here.

1801
02:46:41,574 --> 02:46:43,742
My heart grew cold.

1802
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:47,079
Was my wife comforted
before her execution...

1803
02:46:47,247 --> 02:46:51,291
...while this collaborator
and his pirate masters sneered?

1804
02:46:51,751 --> 02:46:54,086
My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.

1805
02:46:54,254 --> 02:46:55,587
Who are you? What?

1806
02:46:58,258 --> 02:47:01,760
His head burst,
as if pressurized by the guilt within.

1807
02:47:11,312 --> 02:47:13,897
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

1808
02:47:18,028 --> 02:47:20,195
Two figures had ridden here.

1809
02:47:20,363 --> 02:47:23,198
Two must ride back.

1810
02:47:27,328 --> 02:47:29,747
A pirate sentry.

1811
02:47:29,914 --> 02:47:34,001
I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.

1812
02:47:34,961 --> 02:47:38,088
Their violation did not stop
with the good people of Davidstown...

1813
02:47:38,256 --> 02:47:42,426
...but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.

1814
02:47:42,594 --> 02:47:45,888
My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.

1815
02:47:46,056 --> 02:47:49,975
Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the Black Freighter.

1816
02:47:50,143 --> 02:47:56,482
Soon, I would venture amongst evil men,
butchers who now reside in my home...

1817
02:47:56,649 --> 02:47:58,317
...and make them fear me.

1818
02:48:00,904 --> 02:48:05,824
Upon my return home,
I found the streets conspicuously silent.

1819
02:48:07,827 --> 02:48:10,662
I entered my former residence
noiselessly.

1820
02:48:11,331 --> 02:48:17,169
Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers
occupying it from their debauched slumber.

1821
02:48:23,009 --> 02:48:25,010
Unaware that death was amongst them...

1822
02:48:25,345 --> 02:48:30,432
...they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.

1823
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:33,644
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

1824
02:48:33,812 --> 02:48:35,187
Lest he should raise alarms...

1825
02:48:35,355 --> 02:48:39,149
...I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.

1826
02:48:39,859 --> 02:48:41,902
No pirates come, but something worse.

1827
02:48:43,571 --> 02:48:44,613
Father?

1828
02:48:44,781 --> 02:48:49,409
I look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.

1829
02:48:49,702 --> 02:48:53,038
Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.

1830
02:48:53,206 --> 02:48:56,500
My love, why?

1831
02:49:01,005 --> 02:49:06,510
There came an understanding so large
it left no room for sanity.

1832
02:49:07,303 --> 02:49:09,012
So I ran.

1833
02:49:09,514 --> 02:49:11,390
What's happened to her?

1834
02:49:12,267 --> 02:49:13,725
You.

1835
02:49:15,061 --> 02:49:20,816
The knowledge of my damnation paced me,
shouting, celebrating its awful victory.

1836
02:49:20,984 --> 02:49:22,734
My deduction was flawless.

1837
02:49:22,902 --> 02:49:24,987
The Black Freighter
was heading to Davidstown.

1838
02:49:25,155 --> 02:49:28,031
-It should have arrived.
He went that way!

1839
02:49:28,825 --> 02:49:32,369
Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?

1840
02:49:33,329 --> 02:49:35,247
It ends with you in tears.

1841
02:49:35,415 --> 02:49:39,001
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1842
02:49:39,169 --> 02:49:42,588
At some point, yes.

1843
02:49:43,673 --> 02:49:46,592
The streets are filled with death.

1844
02:49:46,759 --> 02:49:48,844
Jon, please.

1845
02:49:49,012 --> 02:49:53,599
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1846
02:49:53,766 --> 02:49:58,103
And the universe will not even notice.

1847
02:50:00,523 --> 02:50:04,776
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1848
02:50:05,612 --> 02:50:08,614
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1849
02:50:10,533 --> 02:50:12,826
Just look around you.

1850
02:50:15,580 --> 02:50:19,917
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1851
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:25,130
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1852
02:50:25,298 --> 02:50:31,220
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1853
02:50:32,055 --> 02:50:33,555
So tell me...

1854
02:50:33,723 --> 02:50:38,101
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1855
02:50:38,561 --> 02:50:40,562
By a shopping mall?

1856
02:50:44,901 --> 02:50:49,196
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1857
02:50:49,364 --> 02:50:51,490
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1858
02:50:51,658 --> 02:50:53,158
Oh, God, Jon!

1859
02:50:53,326 --> 02:50:58,413
-Only what can happen does happen.
-Just stop your bullshit.

1860
02:50:59,499 --> 02:51:02,000
Land this thing. Now.

1861
02:51:02,168 --> 02:51:04,753
As you wish.

1862
02:51:10,343 --> 02:51:11,426
You know what?

1863
02:51:11,594 --> 02:51:14,304
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

1864
02:51:14,472 --> 02:51:16,848
...and all the other worthless humans.

1865
02:51:17,016 --> 02:51:20,435
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

1866
02:51:20,603 --> 02:51:24,773
...and look: nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1867
02:51:24,941 --> 02:51:30,195
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

1868
02:51:30,947 --> 02:51:34,700
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1869
02:51:34,867 --> 02:51:39,288
-You shut out what you're afraid of.
-I'm not afraid.

1870
02:51:39,455 --> 02:51:44,501
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1871
02:51:51,634 --> 02:51:56,722
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

1872
02:51:56,889 --> 02:51:59,975
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1873
02:52:00,143 --> 02:52:02,269
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

1874
02:52:02,437 --> 02:52:05,230
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1875
02:52:05,982 --> 02:52:08,692
Even the grimy parts of it...

1876
02:52:09,068 --> 02:52:11,278
...keep on getting brighter.

1877
02:52:11,612 --> 02:52:15,240
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1878
02:52:15,408 --> 02:52:19,828
-You got her eyes, you know. You got--
-Take your hands off her.

1879
02:52:19,996 --> 02:52:22,122
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1880
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:25,083
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1881
02:52:25,585 --> 02:52:27,419
Now.

1882
02:52:28,421 --> 02:52:30,422
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1883
02:52:30,590 --> 02:52:34,426
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1884
02:52:35,094 --> 02:52:36,803
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1885
02:52:39,098 --> 02:52:40,432
Drive.

1886
02:52:46,439 --> 02:52:49,274
It was a mistake. One time.

1887
02:52:49,567 --> 02:52:52,736
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

1888
02:52:52,945 --> 02:52:55,655
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

1889
02:52:55,823 --> 02:52:58,784
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1890
02:53:02,121 --> 02:53:03,288
Laurie.

1891
02:53:08,127 --> 02:53:09,461
No.

1892
02:53:11,464 --> 02:53:13,965
No, not him.

1893
02:53:14,133 --> 02:53:16,259
The Comedian...

1894
02:53:16,636 --> 02:53:18,762
...was your father.

1895
02:53:20,223 --> 02:53:21,932
No.

1896
02:53:25,228 --> 02:53:30,941
No! No! No!

1897
02:54:03,516 --> 02:54:05,517
My life is just...

1898
02:54:06,185 --> 02:54:08,353
...one big joke.

1899
02:54:08,521 --> 02:54:11,064
I don't think your life is a joke.

1900
02:54:12,692 --> 02:54:14,693
Yeah, well...

1901
02:54:16,529 --> 02:54:20,699
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

1902
02:54:28,875 --> 02:54:30,542
Will you smile...

1903
02:54:32,211 --> 02:54:34,713
...if I admit I was wrong?

1904
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:39,551
About what?

1905
02:54:41,554 --> 02:54:43,054
Miracles.

1906
02:54:44,724 --> 02:54:47,893
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

1907
02:54:48,728 --> 02:54:51,229
...like oxygen turning into gold.

1908
02:54:51,397 --> 02:54:56,234
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

1909
02:54:56,903 --> 02:54:59,279
...that in human coupling...

1910
02:55:00,072 --> 02:55:03,950
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

1911
02:55:04,410 --> 02:55:07,245
...for generation after generation...

1912
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:11,166
...until finally, your mother...

1913
02:55:11,542 --> 02:55:12,751
...loves a man...

1914
02:55:13,377 --> 02:55:16,963
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

1915
02:55:17,131 --> 02:55:21,134
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

1916
02:55:21,802 --> 02:55:23,720
...it's you--

1917
02:55:25,431 --> 02:55:26,765
Only...

1918
02:55:27,433 --> 02:55:28,934
...you.

1919
02:55:29,769 --> 02:55:31,061
--that emerged.

1920
02:55:31,604 --> 02:55:36,107
To distill so specific a form...

1921
02:55:36,275 --> 02:55:38,568
...from all that chaos...

1922
02:55:40,446 --> 02:55:43,448
...is like turning air into gold.

1923
02:55:47,787 --> 02:55:49,788
A miracle.

1924
02:55:53,292 --> 02:55:54,793
And so...

1925
02:55:55,294 --> 02:55:57,128
...I was wrong.

1926
02:55:59,131 --> 02:56:02,968
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1927
02:56:30,496 --> 02:56:34,541
We got a bearing on that artificial structure.
Heat signature's off the charts.

1928
02:56:35,501 --> 02:56:38,628
-Veidt.
-I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1929
02:56:47,013 --> 02:56:49,848
-The engines.
-They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1930
02:56:50,641 --> 02:56:52,684
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1931
02:56:55,521 --> 02:56:58,690
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply--

1932
02:56:58,858 --> 02:57:02,819
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1933
02:57:30,056 --> 02:57:33,725
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1934
02:57:33,893 --> 02:57:36,728
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

1935
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:39,731
You need something warmer.

1936
02:57:40,232 --> 02:57:42,400
Fine like this.

1937
02:58:11,931 --> 02:58:13,765
What is it, girl?

1938
02:58:16,102 --> 02:58:17,769
Mm.

1939
02:58:43,379 --> 02:58:45,630
Adrian's a pacifist.

1940
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:50,468
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1941
02:58:50,636 --> 02:58:52,053
Hitler was vegetarian.

1942
02:58:52,221 --> 02:58:56,766
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

1943
03:00:08,005 --> 03:00:09,339
Gentlemen.

1944
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:13,760
-Welcome.
-Adrian, we know everything.

1945
03:00:13,928 --> 03:00:15,720
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

1946
03:00:15,888 --> 03:00:18,890
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

1947
03:00:19,058 --> 03:00:20,558
May he rest in peace.

1948
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:23,686
Blake figured it out first.

1949
03:00:23,854 --> 03:00:27,899
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.

1950
03:00:28,859 --> 03:00:31,110
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...

1951
03:00:31,278 --> 03:00:35,365
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.

1952
03:00:35,533 --> 03:00:38,785
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

1953
03:00:39,537 --> 03:00:41,079
So...

1954
03:00:42,081 --> 03:00:44,040
...I had to kill him.

1955
03:00:44,583 --> 03:00:48,378
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

1956
03:00:48,546 --> 03:00:51,005
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

1957
03:00:51,173 --> 03:00:53,216
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

1958
03:00:53,384 --> 03:00:55,635
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1959
03:00:56,136 --> 03:00:57,595
Got him to leave the planet.

1960
03:00:57,763 --> 03:01:01,182
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

1961
03:01:01,350 --> 03:01:05,270
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

1962
03:01:05,437 --> 03:01:07,272
...he might as well have been sobbing.

1963
03:01:07,606 --> 03:01:10,775
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

1964
03:01:10,943 --> 03:01:12,819
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

1965
03:01:12,987 --> 03:01:16,614
...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...

1966
03:01:16,782 --> 03:01:18,908
...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.

1967
03:01:19,076 --> 03:01:22,912
Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

1968
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:27,750
 Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

1969
03:01:29,879 --> 03:01:32,964
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

1970
03:01:33,132 --> 03:01:35,758
...leaving only one loose end:

1971
03:01:36,343 --> 03:01:39,804
You, and your mask-killer theory...

1972
03:01:39,972 --> 03:01:43,099
...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

1973
03:01:43,267 --> 03:01:44,976
I tipped off the police.

1974
03:01:45,144 --> 03:01:47,520
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

1975
03:01:47,688 --> 03:01:50,315
Sorry to disappoint you.

1976
03:02:03,495 --> 03:02:05,997
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1977
03:02:06,165 --> 03:02:07,874
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1978
03:02:08,042 --> 03:02:09,375
Nuclear war?

1979
03:02:09,543 --> 03:02:11,711
Human extinction?

1980
03:02:21,347 --> 03:02:26,267
 Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1981
03:02:26,435 --> 03:02:29,395
A few key regions around the globe--

1982
03:02:29,563 --> 03:02:35,026
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

1983
03:02:35,194 --> 03:02:36,861
--disintegrated in an instant.

1984
03:02:37,613 --> 03:02:40,949
Fifteen million people killed...

1985
03:02:41,116 --> 03:02:43,201
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1986
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:47,205
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

1987
03:02:47,373 --> 03:02:48,498
Jon wouldn't do that.

1988
03:02:49,041 --> 03:02:51,751
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

1989
03:02:52,378 --> 03:02:56,214
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

1990
03:02:56,799 --> 03:03:00,802
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

1991
03:03:00,970 --> 03:03:03,513
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

1992
03:03:03,681 --> 03:03:05,682
You see...

1993
03:03:06,558 --> 03:03:08,977
...the Comedian was right.

1994
03:03:09,687 --> 03:03:14,691
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

1995
03:03:14,858 --> 03:03:17,652
So in order to save this planet...

1996
03:03:17,903 --> 03:03:19,988
...I had to trick it...

1997
03:03:20,364 --> 03:03:24,409
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

1998
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:28,079
-Killing millions.
-To save billions.

1999
03:03:28,580 --> 03:03:30,581
A necessary crime.

2000
03:03:30,749 --> 03:03:32,917
You know we can't let you do that.

2001
03:03:34,336 --> 03:03:36,462
"Do that," Rorschach?

2002
03:03:36,630 --> 03:03:38,256
I'm not a comic-book villain.

2003
03:03:39,091 --> 03:03:41,384
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

2004
03:03:41,552 --> 03:03:45,722
...if there were even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?

2005
03:03:48,434 --> 03:03:51,269
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

2006
03:04:15,419 --> 03:04:20,840
Eventually, I came to a dismal
black ocean stretching endlessly before me.

2007
03:04:21,592 --> 03:04:24,969
How had I reached
this appalling position with love...

2008
03:04:25,137 --> 03:04:28,139
...only love, as my guide?

2009
03:04:29,767 --> 03:04:32,852
The moneylender floated at my feet.

2010
03:04:33,020 --> 03:04:35,813
Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.

2011
03:04:35,981 --> 03:04:42,195
The righteous anger fueling my ingenious,
awful scheme was but delusion.

2012
03:04:42,362 --> 03:04:44,322
Where was my error?

2013
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:49,827
Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.

2014
03:04:52,122 --> 03:04:56,542
The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.

2015
03:04:56,710 --> 03:05:00,880
And, gradually, I understood
what innocent intent had brought me to...

2016
03:05:01,799 --> 03:05:04,509
...and waded out beyond my depth.

2017
03:05:05,677 --> 03:05:08,679
The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me...

2018
03:05:08,847 --> 03:05:11,724
...as I swam
towards the anchored Freighter.

2019
03:05:11,892 --> 03:05:16,229
Its dark and lurching mast
filled all my vision.

2020
03:05:16,396 --> 03:05:19,357
All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.

2021
03:05:19,525 --> 03:05:23,319
The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.

2022
03:05:24,196 --> 03:05:26,030
A rope snaked down.

2023
03:05:26,198 --> 03:05:28,366
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

2024
03:05:28,534 --> 03:05:31,202
And from the decks above,
a cheer went up...

2025
03:05:31,370 --> 03:05:35,748
...both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.

2026
03:05:38,544 --> 03:05:40,920
There had been no plan
to capture Davidstown.

2027
03:05:41,755 --> 03:05:45,800
They'd come to wait until they could collect
the only prize they valued.

2028
03:05:47,010 --> 03:05:50,138
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

2029
03:05:56,145 --> 03:05:58,229
I was a horror.

2030
03:05:59,064 --> 03:06:02,400
Amongst horrors must I dwell.

2031
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:15,913
-Man, this shit don't make no sense.
-You're telling me.

2032
03:06:17,249 --> 03:06:20,585
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage.
Wasting all my damn time.

2033
03:06:20,752 --> 03:06:23,921
Hey, hey. You know, all this time
you've been coming here...

2034
03:06:24,089 --> 03:06:25,590
...I never caught your name.

2035
03:06:27,301 --> 03:06:30,303
-Bernard.
-Bernard? You're kidding.

2036
03:06:30,470 --> 03:06:34,557
That's-- Heh. That's my name too.

2037
03:06:35,184 --> 03:06:38,436
Not that big a deal.
There's lots of people called Bernard.

2038
03:08:03,647 --> 03:08:06,649
Jesus Christ, Henry.

2039
03:08:06,817 --> 03:08:09,026
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

2040
03:08:10,904 --> 03:08:15,366
It's not the Soviets, sir.

2041
03:08:15,909 --> 03:08:19,078
Intel indicates the energy signature...

2042
03:08:19,246 --> 03:08:21,706
...was generated by...

2043
03:08:22,666 --> 03:08:25,084
...Dr. Manhattan.

2044
03:08:27,921 --> 03:08:29,505
Jon.

2045
03:08:32,509 --> 03:08:33,634
Interference.

2046
03:08:34,219 --> 03:08:36,137
Cataclysmic interference.

2047
03:08:45,856 --> 03:08:48,607
I can't believe it happened.

2048
03:08:49,609 --> 03:08:53,112
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

2049
03:08:57,200 --> 03:08:58,492
It was me.

2050
03:09:00,537 --> 03:09:02,121
I...

2051
03:09:02,706 --> 03:09:03,748
...did this.

2052
03:09:04,374 --> 03:09:07,835
-What do you mean, you did this?
-Not directly.

2053
03:09:08,795 --> 03:09:11,505
It was made to look like I did it.

2054
03:09:14,551 --> 03:09:15,968
Adrian.

2055
03:09:22,267 --> 03:09:24,268
Speak of the devil.

2056
03:09:27,397 --> 03:09:28,439
Jon--
I know.

2057
03:09:28,607 --> 03:09:30,775
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

2058
03:09:30,942 --> 03:09:32,276
Wait here.

2059
03:09:43,413 --> 03:09:45,790
Adrian, stop this.

2060
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:49,126
The tachyons were clever...

2061
03:09:50,253 --> 03:09:54,590
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.

2062
03:09:55,926 --> 03:09:58,386
I should thank you.

2063
03:09:59,554 --> 03:10:02,765
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

2064
03:10:03,767 --> 03:10:06,769
...the delights of uncertainty.

2065
03:10:10,941 --> 03:10:12,608
Forgive me, girl.

2066
03:10:35,549 --> 03:10:37,258
You're such an asshole.

2067
03:11:11,209 --> 03:11:13,127
Veidt, you bastard.

2068
03:11:13,295 --> 03:11:15,754
-If you've hurt her, I'll--
-Dan...

2069
03:11:17,507 --> 03:11:22,094
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

2070
03:11:22,262 --> 03:11:24,263
Your...

2071
03:11:24,431 --> 03:11:29,393
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

2072
03:11:31,021 --> 03:11:33,898
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

2073
03:11:34,858 --> 03:11:37,234
...is your only triumph.

2074
03:11:37,444 --> 03:11:39,361
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2075
03:11:40,155 --> 03:11:43,657
I'm very disappointed.

2076
03:11:56,046 --> 03:11:59,215
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

2077
03:11:59,883 --> 03:12:02,259
It didn't kill Osterman.

2078
03:12:04,888 --> 03:12:07,264
Did you really think it would kill me?

2079
03:12:08,558 --> 03:12:11,727
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

2080
03:12:12,229 --> 03:12:15,397
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

2081
03:12:15,565 --> 03:12:18,609
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

2082
03:12:18,777 --> 03:12:22,446
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2083
03:12:23,573 --> 03:12:26,075
The world's smartest man...

2084
03:12:26,368 --> 03:12:28,786
...poses no more threat to me...

2085
03:12:28,954 --> 03:12:32,122
...than does its smartest termite.

2086
03:12:34,376 --> 03:12:35,834
What's that?

2087
03:12:36,253 --> 03:12:38,128
Another ultimate weapon?

2088
03:12:38,755 --> 03:12:40,464
Yes.

2089
03:12:42,092 --> 03:12:43,551
You could say that.

2090
03:12:47,097 --> 03:12:49,014
--came under attack.

2091
03:12:49,849 --> 03:12:53,185
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

2092
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:58,732
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2093
03:13:00,527 --> 03:13:04,488
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

2094
03:13:04,656 --> 03:13:07,658
...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2095
03:13:08,034 --> 03:13:10,869
Putting aside our past differences...

2096
03:13:11,204 --> 03:13:13,372
...we have both pledged to unite...

2097
03:13:13,707 --> 03:13:17,042
...against this common enemy.

2098
03:13:17,544 --> 03:13:19,545
With the rest of the world...

2099
03:13:20,005 --> 03:13:22,006
...we will prevail.

2100
03:13:24,551 --> 03:13:27,553
This is a day we shall never forget.

2101
03:13:27,721 --> 03:13:31,932
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

2102
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:36,729
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

2103
03:13:38,064 --> 03:13:42,318
Thank you. God bless us all.

2104
03:13:42,694 --> 03:13:44,486
Do you see?

2105
03:13:46,698 --> 03:13:49,158
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2106
03:13:50,744 --> 03:13:53,203
I've saved the earth from hell.

2107
03:13:53,371 --> 03:13:55,331
We both have.

2108
03:13:55,790 --> 03:13:58,000
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2109
03:14:02,797 --> 03:14:04,298
Now we can return...

2110
03:14:05,717 --> 03:14:07,301
...do what we were meant to.

2111
03:14:07,552 --> 03:14:10,429
We were meant to exact justice.

2112
03:14:10,764 --> 03:14:14,099
-Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
-Will they?

2113
03:14:14,267 --> 03:14:19,063
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2114
03:14:19,230 --> 03:14:22,691
-Peace based on a lie.
-But peace...

2115
03:14:22,859 --> 03:14:25,069
-...nonetheless.
-He's right.

2116
03:14:25,612 --> 03:14:29,573
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2117
03:14:29,741 --> 03:14:32,618
No. We can't do this.

2118
03:14:32,786 --> 03:14:34,578
On Mars...

2119
03:14:36,081 --> 03:14:37,915
...you taught me the value of life.

2120
03:14:38,875 --> 03:14:41,293
If we hope to preserve it here...

2121
03:14:42,087 --> 03:14:44,129
...we must remain silent.

2122
03:14:47,967 --> 03:14:49,927
Keep your own secrets.

2123
03:14:56,768 --> 03:14:57,976
Don't even think about it.

2124
03:15:00,605 --> 03:15:02,314
Rorschach.

2125
03:15:04,109 --> 03:15:05,609
Wait.

2126
03:15:06,653 --> 03:15:08,779
Never compromise.

2127
03:15:09,114 --> 03:15:11,990
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2128
03:15:12,409 --> 03:15:15,411
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2129
03:15:26,464 --> 03:15:29,967
I've made myself feel every death...

2130
03:15:31,469 --> 03:15:37,349
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2131
03:15:42,939 --> 03:15:46,650
-You understand, don't you?
 Without condoning...

2132
03:15:48,319 --> 03:15:50,195
...or condemning...

2133
03:15:54,617 --> 03:15:56,535
...I understand.

2134
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:07,087
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2135
03:16:07,964 --> 03:16:09,882
You know I can't let you do that.

2136
03:16:11,134 --> 03:16:14,136
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2137
03:16:15,555 --> 03:16:17,389
Convenient.

2138
03:16:26,107 --> 03:16:30,694
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2139
03:16:34,449 --> 03:16:37,409
I can change almost anything...

2140
03:16:41,998 --> 03:16:44,333
...but I can't change human nature.

2141
03:16:45,668 --> 03:16:49,046
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2142
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:53,675
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2143
03:16:59,849 --> 03:17:01,725
Well, what are you waiting for?

2144
03:17:05,188 --> 03:17:07,022
Do it.

2145
03:17:13,112 --> 03:17:14,154
Do it!

2146
03:17:16,866 --> 03:17:20,244
No!

2147
03:17:37,720 --> 03:17:43,475
I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

2148
03:17:43,643 --> 03:17:46,144
I thought you said you cared
about life again.

2149
03:17:46,312 --> 03:17:47,729
I do.

2150
03:17:49,065 --> 03:17:51,942
I think maybe I'll create some.

2151
03:17:56,072 --> 03:17:58,407
Goodbye, Laurie.

2152
03:18:33,651 --> 03:18:34,818
Come on.

2153
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:38,864
Come on!

2154
03:18:43,286 --> 03:18:44,620
Dan...

2155
03:18:45,079 --> 03:18:47,831
...a world united and at peace.

2156
03:18:48,708 --> 03:18:49,917
There had to be sacrifice.

2157
03:18:50,084 --> 03:18:54,463
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

2158
03:18:54,631 --> 03:18:56,381
You've mutilated it.

2159
03:18:56,758 --> 03:18:58,926
That's your legacy.

2160
03:19:07,477 --> 03:19:10,270
That's the real practical joke.

2161
03:20:02,865 --> 03:20:06,868
We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

2162
03:20:07,036 --> 03:20:10,497
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

2163
03:20:10,665 --> 03:20:13,834
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

2164
03:20:14,002 --> 03:20:19,798
...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

2165
03:20:21,009 --> 03:20:23,218
Sure you don't want a drink?

2166
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:25,262
I'm okay.

2167
03:20:26,305 --> 03:20:27,556
Cheers.

2168
03:20:28,975 --> 03:20:32,102
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

2169
03:20:33,396 --> 03:20:35,897
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2170
03:20:38,901 --> 03:20:40,652
Laurel.

2171
03:20:41,654 --> 03:20:43,989
What you must think of me.

2172
03:20:44,824 --> 03:20:47,367
I'm sorry I never told you.

2173
03:20:47,535 --> 03:20:49,327
I should have...

2174
03:20:49,495 --> 03:20:53,623
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

2175
03:20:53,791 --> 03:20:55,751
It doesn't matter.

2176
03:20:56,586 --> 03:21:01,840
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

2177
03:21:02,425 --> 03:21:05,343
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2178
03:21:05,511 --> 03:21:07,846
I know how that is...

2179
03:21:08,598 --> 03:21:11,183
...but I just want you to know...

2180
03:21:11,768 --> 03:21:14,603
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

2181
03:21:18,775 --> 03:21:23,028
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2182
03:21:24,614 --> 03:21:27,115
Because he gave me you.

2183
03:21:32,121 --> 03:21:33,205
Thanks, Mom.

2184
03:21:35,958 --> 03:21:37,751
I love you.

2185
03:21:45,301 --> 03:21:49,513
-Hello, Miss Jupiter.
-Oh, Sally, please.

2186
03:21:51,140 --> 03:21:55,727
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2187
03:22:06,239 --> 03:22:10,408
-So how's it going up here?
-Good. How's it going down there?

2188
03:22:10,576 --> 03:22:14,079
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2189
03:22:14,247 --> 03:22:18,875
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

2190
03:22:19,043 --> 03:22:21,294
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

2191
03:22:21,462 --> 03:22:24,548
Well, that sounds like a date.

2192
03:22:35,852 --> 03:22:38,103
Are we gonna be all right?

2193
03:22:40,189 --> 03:22:44,484
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

2194
03:22:44,694 --> 03:22:46,570
...in the end.

2195
03:22:48,197 --> 03:22:50,365
I know what Jon would say:

2196
03:22:50,533 --> 03:22:52,576
Nothing ends.

2197
03:22:54,453 --> 03:22:57,080
Nothing ever ends.

2198
03:23:44,420 --> 03:23:48,173
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2199
03:23:48,341 --> 03:23:49,716
Everyone in the country...

2200
03:23:49,884 --> 03:23:52,135
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

2201
03:23:52,303 --> 03:23:55,597
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

2202
03:23:56,098 --> 03:23:58,975
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2203
03:23:59,143 --> 03:24:03,063
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2204
03:24:03,231 --> 03:24:05,065
We could run a piece on that.

2205
03:24:05,233 --> 03:24:08,401
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2206
03:24:08,569 --> 03:24:12,405
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2207
03:24:13,157 --> 03:24:17,369
Okay. I could look for something

2208
03:24:17,536 --> 03:24:19,162
Crank file.

2209
03:24:19,330 --> 03:24:21,331
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2210
03:24:21,499 --> 03:24:24,125
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2211
03:24:30,633 --> 03:24:35,345
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

2212
03:24:35,513 --> 03:24:39,975
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
