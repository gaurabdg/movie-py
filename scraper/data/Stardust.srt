1
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,970
<i>A philosopher once asked,</i>

2
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:46,568
<i>"Are we human
because we gaze at the stars,</i>

3
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:50,409
<i>"or do we gaze at them
because we are human?"</i>

4
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,910
<i>Pointless, really.</i>

5
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>Do the stars gaze back?</i>

6
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:58,753
<i>Now, that's a question.</i>

7
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,559
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

8
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,824
<i>Our story really begins here,</i>

9
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>150 years ago
at the Royal Academy of Science</i>

10
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,966
<i>in London, England,</i>

11
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,808
<i>where a letter arrived,
containing a very strange inquiry.</i>

12
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:21,908
<i>It had come from a country boy</i>

13
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:27,179
<i>and the scientist who read it thought it
might be a practical joke of some kind.</i>

14
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,914
<i>But he duly wrote a reply</i>

15
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,185
<i>politely explaining
that the query was nonsense.</i>

16
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:39,258
<i>And posted it to the boy
who lived in a village called Wall,</i>

17
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:43,460
<i>so named, the boy had said,
for the wall that ran alongside it.</i>

18
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:49,530
<i>A wall that, according to local folklore,
hid an extraordinary secret.</i>

19
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,101
I'm charged with guarding the portal
to another world.

20
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,650
And you're asking me
to just let you through?

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,652
Yes.
Because, let's be honest, it's a field.

22
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:06,121
Look, do you see
another world out there?

23
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:10,821
No. You see a field.
Do you see anything nonhuman?

24
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,421
No. And you know why?
Because it's a field!

25
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,764
Hundreds of years,
this wall's been here.

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,637
Hundreds of years,
this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

27
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,574
- Well...
- One more word,

28
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:29,636
and I'll have you up
in front of the village council!

29
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:34,448
- Well, that sounds rather final.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:40,882
- Better just go home, then, I suppose.
- Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

31
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,854
Give my best to your father.

32
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,157
Stop!

33
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,693
Stop!

34
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,841
I don't deal with time-wasters.

35
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,747
Get over here and tend this stall.

36
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,786
I'm off to The Slaughtered Prince
for a pint.

37
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,958
See anything you like?

38
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,430
Definitely.

39
00:03:55,534 --> 00:04:00,198
I mean, what I meant was these ones,
the blue ones.

40
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,767
How much are they?

41
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,741
They might be the color of your hair.

42
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:09,974
Or they might be all of your memories
before you were three.

43
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,346
I can check if you like.

44
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,888
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
Buy this one instead.

45
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,154
Snowdrop.

46
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,024
It'll bring you luck.

47
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,330
But what does that cost?

48
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,966
This one costs a kiss.

49
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,589
Is she gone?

50
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,889
Follow me.

51
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,002
I'm a princess,
tricked into being a witch's slave.

52
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,967
Will you liberate me?

53
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:25,714
It's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.

54
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,150
Sorry.

55
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, if I can't liberate you,
what do you want of me?

56
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,307
<i>So, the scientist was wrong.</i>

57
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
<i>The wall had successfully done its job</i>

58
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,655
<i>of hiding
the magical kingdom of Stormhold.</i>

59
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,628
<i>The young man returned that night
to his home in England,</i>

60
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,962
<i>hoping that his adventure
would soon be forgotten.</i>

61
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:14,027
<i>But nine months later,
he received an unexpected souvenir.</i>

62
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:27,677
This was left at the wall for you.
It says here his name is Tristan.

63
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,677
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

64
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,374
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

65
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:03,187
<i>Eighteen years passed,
and the baby Tristan grew up</i>

66
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,621
<i>knowing nothing
of his unconventional heritage.</i>

67
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:12,358
<i>But never mind
how the infant became a boy.</i>

68
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:16,764
<i>This is the story of
how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,</i>

69
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,127
<i>a much greater challenge altogether.</i>

70
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,437
<i>For to achieve it,</i>

71
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:27,603
<i>he must win the heart
of his one true love.</i>

72
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,612
- It's him!
- It's him!

73
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,049
Humphrey?

74
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,647
- No, it's Tristan.
- Oh.

75
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,186
Did I leave something at the shop?

76
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,730
No. I just thought I could bring...

77
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,193
Tristan Thorn,

78
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,203
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

79
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,569
Is there no end to your charms?

80
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,702
Humphrey,
there's no need to be like that.

81
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,744
Be nice to the poor boy.

82
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,981
Were those for Victoria?

83
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,358
You were always useless at fencing
in school, Tristan.

84
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,799
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering
if there was anything you were good at.

85
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,303
Humphrey, that's enough.

86
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,036
Are you all right?

87
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,373
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

88
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,368
- Want some breakfast?
- No, I'm really late for work.

89
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:04,203
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine. Why?

90
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:08,803
Oh, I don't know.
Last night, how'd it go?

91
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,315
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

92
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,863
Hello, Tristan.

93
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,458
- Victoria.
- Pound of sugar, please.

94
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:37,599
- Yes.
- Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

95
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,769
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.

96
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,474
I also need a sack of potatoes
and some chocolate, please.

97
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,721
May I perhaps see you tonight?

98
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,249
No, but you may walk me home.

99
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,652
Now?

100
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,323
Yes. Yes, I can.

101
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,502
Father, I lost my job.

102
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,873
Father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.

103
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,173
- Father...
- You lost your job.

104
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,539
Yes, so I heard.

105
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,683
Father, I'm sorry. I...

106
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,621
Maybe Mr. Monday was right.
Maybe I am deluding myself.

107
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:28,955
- I'm not good enough for Victoria.
- He said that? That's poppycock.

108
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,823
You really want to know
how it went last night?

109
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,021
Yeah.

110
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,193
Not good.

111
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,691
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

112
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,234
I'm not like Humphrey.

113
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,709
Tristan, I can tell you that every man
I ever envied when I was a boy

114
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,605
has led an unremarkable life.

115
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:54,344
So you don't fit with the popular crowd.
Now, I take that as a very good omen.

116
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,129
- Tristan, I clearly said...
- I know. You told me not to come.

117
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,829
I have something for you. A surprise.

118
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,030
No...

119
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,414
It's not my birthday for another week,
you know.

120
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,327
- I've never had champagne before.
- Yeah, me, neither.

121
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,098
My God! This is delicious!

122
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,770
How did... Well,
how does a shop boy afford all of this?

123
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,567
I'm not a shop boy.

124
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,703
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
What are you going to do now?

125
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,577
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.

126
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,912
And now I'm not.
Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

127
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,486
This must have been all your savings.

128
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,613
So? I can make more.
That's the beauty of it.

129
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,316
I never intended to stay in Wall,
Victoria.

130
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,758
There's a big world out there,
I'm gonna make my fortune.

131
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,490
Now you sound just like Humphrey.
He's quite a traveler.

132
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:17,830
Do you know he's going all the way
to Ipswich just to buy me a ring?

133
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,369
Lpswich?

134
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,430
Victoria, I'm talking about London
or Paris or...

135
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,341
A ring? Why is he...
What kind of a ring?

136
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,312
The word is he's planning to propose
to me on my birthday.

137
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,006
He's going to...

138
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,750
And you're gonna say yes.

139
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:38,380
I can't exactly say no
after he's gone all the way to Ipswich.

140
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,583
"All the way to Ipswich"?

141
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:45,595
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,
I'd cross oceans or continents.

142
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,921
- Really?
- Yes.

143
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,431
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

144
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,901
I would go to
the gold fields of San Francisco

145
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,472
and bring you back your weight in gold.

146
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,602
I would.

147
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:02,570
I'd go to Africa and bring you back
a diamond as big as your fist.

148
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,181
Or I'd go to the Arctic
and I'd slaughter a polar bear

149
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,411
and bring you back its head.

150
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,483
A polar bear's head?

151
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,025
You're funny, Tristan.

152
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:23,066
People like you and people like me,
we're just not...

153
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,405
I should be going. It's really late.

154
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:32,033
Well, hold on, then.
Let's at least finish the champagne.

155
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,336
Okay.

156
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,776
<i>Had Tristan known then
how the stars watched Earth,</i>

157
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,684
<i>he'd have shuddered at the very thought</i>

158
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,189
<i>of an audience to his humiliation.</i>

159
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,356
<i>But, fortunately for him,</i>

160
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,431
<i>nearly every star in the sky
was at that moment</i>

161
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,662
<i>looking in earnest at the land
on the other side of the wall,</i>

162
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,331
<i>where the King of all Stormhold
lay on his deathbed,</i>

163
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,342
<i>which was a coincidence
because it was the King's final act</i>

164
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:11,814
<i>that would change the course
of Tristars destiny forever.</i>

165
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,985
Where is Secundus?

166
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,980
He's on his way, Father.

167
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,785
Then we shall wait.

168
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,432
Sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.

169
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,572
Septimus.

170
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,206
Primus.

171
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,542
Tertius.

172
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:49,685
So, to the matter of succession.

173
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,592
Of my seven sons,
there are four of you today still standing.

174
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:00,994
This is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.

175
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,896
And you killed them all for your throne

176
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:06,027
before your father, the King,
even felt poorly.

177
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,604
We know, Father.
You're strong and courageous.

178
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,575
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

179
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,042
- Secundus.
- Yes, Father?

180
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,449
Look through the window.
Tell me what you see.

181
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,319
I see the kingdom, Father.

182
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,759
The whole of Stormhold.

183
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,563
- And?
- My kingdom?

184
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,070
Maybe. Look up.

185
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:12,695
- Secundus.
- Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

186
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:18,001
You're alive. You're...

187
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:21,010
Stuck like this
till the new king is crowned.

188
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,974
I was that close.

189
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,346
Well, at least
you haven't lost your looks.

190
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,352
Oh, please. You're not annoyed
about that whole murder thing, are you?

191
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:32,446
- I mean, that was 10 years ago.
- Yeah.

192
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,457
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it,
killing me, Secundus?

193
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,824
Because now, of course,
now you are King of all Stormhold.

194
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,796
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not.
You're dead.

195
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:44,061
Una? Una?

196
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:48,229
No, Father, it's me, your son.

197
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,368
Tertius.

198
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,507
Where is your sister, Una?

199
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,912
Sorry, Father.
Nobody has seen Una for years now.

200
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,212
- Septimus?
- What?

201
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,814
Tradition dictates the throne must pass
to a male heir.

202
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,051
Exactly, Father.

203
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,890
So why would I kill my sister
when these cretins are still alive?

204
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,156
Indeed.

205
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:20,502
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation
in a non-traditional manner.

206
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:49,565
Only he of royal blood
can restore the ruby.

207
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:56,300
And the one of you that does so
shall be the new King of Stormhold.

208
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,586
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

209
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,192
Beautiful.

210
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,368
More beautiful than a fancy ring
from Ipswich?

211
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:05,973
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

212
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:09,740
I'd cross the wall
and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

213
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,005
You can't cross the wall.

214
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,977
Nobody crosses the wall.
Now you're just being silly.

215
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,919
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

216
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,681
For you, I'd do anything.

217
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,561
My very own star.

218
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,928
It seems we have ourselves
an agreement.

219
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,270
You have exactly one week
or I'm marrying Humphrey.

220
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,438
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

221
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,941
- What is it?
- A star has fallen.

222
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,591
Where are the Babylon candles?

223
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:10,395
You used the last one, Lamia,
200 years ago. Do you not recall?

224
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,761
Perhaps we can obtain another.

225
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,306
Has your mind become
as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

226
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,171
You speak as if such things
are freely available.

227
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,642
I know, sister, I merely thought...

228
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,269
You'd have us hunting
for a Babylon candle

229
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,144
while some other witch finds our star.

230
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,843
Fool. There's no time to waste.

231
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,384
If we must retrieve it on foot,
then we shall.

232
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,582
Mormo, we need information.

233
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:47,702
If these divinations are correct,
the fallen star lies 100 miles away.

234
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:56,211
Four centuries we've waited for this.
What hardship a few more days?

235
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,750
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it
and bring it back?

236
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,723
- I've his kidney.
- I've his liver.

237
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,522
And I've his heart.

238
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:17,157
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

239
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,975
- There's not much left.
- Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

240
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:28,998
- Dunstan Thorn. Not again.
- It's Tristan, actually.

241
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:33,833
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.

242
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:37,402
And I suppose you intend
to cross the wall as well, do you?

243
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,346
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

244
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,611
Cross the wall as well as who?

245
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,751
No one. Nobody.

246
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,323
Nobody crosses the wall.
You know that!

247
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,689
Everybody knows that!

248
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:53,321
Yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.

249
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,532
Well, I better just head
for the old homestead, then.

250
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:58,761
Yeah.

251
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:03,033
- Right, then. Night, Tristan.
- Good night.

252
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,233
Give my best to your father.

253
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:29,730
Off you go.

254
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:39,072
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

255
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,404
No, I'm fine.

256
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,001
- That Humphrey again?
- No.

257
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:45,445
Actually, it was the guard.
The guard at the wall.

258
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,749
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

259
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,982
Well, that's given him plenty of time
to practice, then, hasn't it?

260
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,653
Why, may I ask,
were you trying to cross the wall?

261
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,226
I might ask you the same thing.

262
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,572
I have a mother.

263
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,985
I mean, I have a mother.
She could still be alive.

264
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,021
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

265
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,587
The chain you cut.

266
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,094
Just like you said.

267
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,323
And...

268
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:13,936
And the glass flower.
The flower she sold to you.

269
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,029
She told me it would bring me luck.

270
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,437
Thank you.

271
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:22,406
This was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.

272
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,978
It's addressed to you.

273
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:42,424
Yep.

274
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:47,027
"My dearest Tristan, please know that
I only ever wanted the best for you. "

275
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:52,499
<i>Had my mistress allowed it,
I would have kept you in a heartbeat.</i>

276
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:56,711
<i>My dearest wish is that
we will meet someday.</i>

277
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,249
<i>The fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.</i>

278
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,554
<i>To use it, think of me and only me.</i>

279
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,424
<i>I will think of you every day, for always.</i>

280
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,530
"Your mother. "

281
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,332
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

282
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,683
Mother?

283
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:13,018
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

284
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:16,388
No, I'm not.
And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

285
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,588
You're... You're not my mother?

286
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,995
Do I look like I'm your mother?

287
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,391
No.

288
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,862
Sorry.

289
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:29,867
Well, are you all right?
Do you want some help?

290
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,339
You can help by leaving me alone!

291
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,941
All right.

292
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:45,587
Oh, my God.
"Light the candle and think of me. "

293
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,714
I was. I was thinking of my...

294
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,555
But then Victoria and the star
just popped into...

295
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,523
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

296
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,535
This may seem strange, but
have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

297
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,136
- You're funny.
- No, really, we're in a crater.

298
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,333
This must be where it fell.

299
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,403
Yeah, this is where it fell.

300
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,480
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

301
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,913
up there is where
this weird, bloody necklace

302
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,143
came out of nowhere
and knocked it out of the heavens

303
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,083
when it was minding its own business.

304
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,087
And over there is where it landed.

305
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:24,957
And right here, this is where it got hit
by a magical flying moron!

306
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,363
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

307
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:36,631
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...

308
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,473
May I just say in advance
that I am sorry?

309
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,905
- Sorry for what?
- For this.

310
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,915
Now, if I am not mistaken,
this means you have to come with me.

311
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:50,680
See, you're going to be a birthday gift
for Victoria, my true love.

312
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,153
But of course!

313
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,249
Nothing says romance like the gift
of a kidnapped, injured woman!

314
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,891
I'm not going anywhere with you.

315
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:07,035
Hurry. You should be
on your way now, Primus.

316
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:12,298
You must find the royal necklace
with the ruby before your brothers.

317
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:16,812
I should like to see you take the throne.
The first benevolent king.

318
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:21,508
I don't doubt Stormhold would be
a better place under your rule.

319
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:22,846
Really?

320
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,444
Well, that is fascinating.

321
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,683
- Don't you think, Tertius?
- Yes, indeed.

322
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,592
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
Well, well, I...

323
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,194
Since you're all here,
won't you join me in a toast?

324
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,563
What a very good idea.

325
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,071
To the new King of Stormhold,

326
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,404
whichever of you fine fellows
it might be.

327
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:49,339
To the new King of Stormhold.

328
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,779
You!

329
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,874
You really thought that you were king?

330
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,582
- You killed the Bishop?
- No, Primus.

331
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:06,520
I think you'll find that you killed the
Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

332
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,525
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling
with your conscience,

333
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,356
may I suggest you return
to your chamber?

334
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,862
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

335
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,937
How have we lived this way
all these years?

336
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,880
In my absence, I expect you to make it
fit for the queens we are.

337
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,861
When I return with our prize,
all of us shall be young again.

338
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,692
Never fear, my sisters.

339
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:54,795
I will not fail.

340
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,681
Don't you ever sleep?

341
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:07,750
Not at night.

342
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,583
May have escaped your notice, genius,

343
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,711
but that's when stars
have rather better things to do.

344
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,120
They're coming out, shining,
that sort of thing.

345
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,455
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours,
but you're not in the sky anymore.

346
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,529
Coming out is off the agenda.

347
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:23,326
Shining has been suspended
until further notice.

348
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,869
Oh, and sleeping during the day
is O-U-T.

349
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:31,062
Unless you have some magical ability
to sleep while you're walking.

350
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:33,540
Have you not got it
into your thick head yet?

351
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,634
I'm not walking anywhere!

352
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,539
Fine.

353
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:41,141
Sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.

354
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,112
I was gonna put you back in the sky
once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

355
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,418
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own
in the middle of nowhere forever.

356
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,891
And just how were you planning
to get me back to the sky?

357
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:54,259
I find the fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

358
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:58,566
- You've got a Babylon candle.
- Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

359
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,226
- A Babylon candle.
- That's what I said.

360
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:01,326
You said "Bubbling. "

361
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:03,838
Anyway, I was going to give
what's left of it to you.

362
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,272
Well, that barely has one use left.

363
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:10,870
So be grateful I'm not using it right now
to get us both back to the wall.

364
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:14,348
Unless you have a better way of
getting yourself home.

365
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,113
Fine!

366
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,216
Help me up.

367
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,291
All right. All right. I'm helping.

368
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,253
And you are gonna have to walk
quicker than that.

369
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:29,127
Otherwise, I'll never get you back
to Victoria in a week.

370
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,699
Don't push your luck.

371
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,437
Don't take less than a florin for him,
Bernard! You understand?

372
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,667
- Yes, Mother.
- No dilly-dallying!

373
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,677
And don't even think of stopping at the
tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

374
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,906
A florin for your goat, boy.

375
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,785
Oh.

376
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,755
He's a bit small to pull your can't.

377
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,319
You're quite right.

378
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,365
That's much better.

379
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,271
Bernard!

380
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:17,341
Bernard!

381
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:40,763
Get on!

382
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,270
Who goes there?

383
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,366
What do you want with me,
a poor old flower...

384
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,412
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

385
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:28,143
and I swear by the ordinances of the
sisterhood to which we both belong

386
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:30,719
that I mean you no harm this day.

387
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,811
I wish to share your meal.

388
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:39,126
Well, one can never be too careful.
Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

389
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,868
- Anything else?
- Nope.

390
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,034
What's it to be?

391
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,203
Heads or tails?

392
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,041
Heads.

393
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,579
So, stranger,

394
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,045
where are you headed off to
on this fine day?

395
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,090
I seek a fallen star.

396
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,956
She fell not far from here.

397
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,291
And when I find her,
I shall take my great knife

398
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,864
and cut out her heart
while she still lives.

399
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:20,426
And the glory of our youth
shall be restored.

400
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,403
Fallen star?

401
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,098
That's the best news I've had in ages.

402
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,973
I could do with losing
a few years meself.

403
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,138
So whereabouts did you...

404
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,772
Limbus grass!

405
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:38,218
You dare to steal truth from my lips
by feeding me limbus grass?

406
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:42,587
Do you have any idea what a big
mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

407
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,786
How do you know my...

408
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,886
- Who are you?
- Look again.

409
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:54,335
I shall not seek the star,
Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

410
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,098
Seek all you wish.

411
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,733
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

412
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:06,306
You will not perceive her
even if she stands before you.

413
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,259
Pray you never meet me again,
Ditchwater Sal.

414
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,952
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.

415
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:21,622
You think you know
we're going the right way because...

416
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,495
And I quote, "I just do. "

417
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,296
I do, though. I don't know why.

418
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,065
Maybe it's my love for Victoria
guiding me home.

419
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,730
- Please.
- Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

420
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,468
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

421
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,874
How many times do I have to...

422
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,743
Would you...
Would you please slow down?

423
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,110
Yes, yes.

424
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,212
Look, we're...
We're going north, all right?

425
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,582
The wall's north.

426
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,851
And if you look up in the sky,
even during the day, you can see the...

427
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,652
The evening star. That's so weird.

428
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,624
That's funny. Hilarious.
My sides are splitting.

429
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,320
No, I'm being...

430
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:57,694
Wait that... That was you! Really?

431
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,731
What... What are...

432
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:03,169
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

433
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:05,434
- Sitting down. I'm tired.
- Please don't do this again.

434
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,010
We agreed we'd stop off
at the next village to eat and rest.

435
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,080
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

436
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:16,015
I never stay up this late!
Just, please, let me sleep!

437
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:21,347
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.

438
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,325
What are you doing?

439
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:33,664
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making sure you don't run away.

440
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:54,189
Your Highness, the soothsayer,
as you requested.

441
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,217
South, you said.

442
00:39:58,194 --> 00:39:59,684
South we went.

443
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,655
Still no stone.

444
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,694
Do you now propose
we start swimming?

445
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:11,866
Sire, I've merely relayed to you
what the runes have told me.

446
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,567
I can do no more.

447
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,812
Well, consult them again.

448
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,339
Wait.

449
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:25,344
Before we seek the stone,
I have another question.

450
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,087
Am I the seventh son?

451
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,722
Yes.

452
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,458
Another question.

453
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,828
Is my favorite color blue?

454
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,529
Yes.

455
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:48,372
Has excessive begging or pleading
ever persuaded me

456
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,742
to spare the life of a traitor?

457
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,574
What does that mean?

458
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,245
- That means no.
- Good.

459
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:02,157
Throw them again.
This time, throw them high.

460
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,288
Do you work for my brother?

461
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,740
So, do we continue west?

462
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,408
Tristan?

463
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,823
Who's there?

464
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,063
Tristan, is that you?

465
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,659
It's not funny.

466
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,237
Tristan?

467
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,648
Come on.

468
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,625
Be careful how much magic
you use, sister.

469
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,531
It's beginning to show.

470
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,969
One goat and a small enchantment.
Hardly extravagant.

471
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:33,008
Well, even using the ring
will take its toll.

472
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,441
Better you call on us only in dire need.

473
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,844
And use your runes
to locate the star yourself.

474
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:40,939
I used them and she should be here.

475
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,848
But now
they're just telling me gibberish.

476
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:04,102
It is because you must stay
where you are, my sister.

477
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,435
She is coming to you.

478
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,169
Oh, be warned, Lamia.
Delicacy is needed.

479
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:12,304
Misery has drained her.
She's barely shining.

480
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,148
Set a trap that ensures her heart
is glowing before you cut it out.

481
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:21,150
Yvaine! Yvaine!

482
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,515
Oh, you idiot.

483
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:47,909
You shall become human.

484
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:09,159
You are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

485
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:13,725
Now, make everything ready.
Our special guest will be here soon.

486
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:28,743
I mean, who's to say he'd have even
kept his promise about the candle?

487
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,514
I just refuse to believe
he's the only person in Stormhold

488
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:34,317
who could've helped me.

489
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:38,689
Going on and on and on.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that. "

490
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,325
<i>Tristan?</i>

491
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,360
<i>Please protect our sister, Tristan.</i>

492
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,236
<i>Yvaine is in grave danger.</i>

493
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:53,371
<i>The unicorn came to help her.</i>

494
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,601
<i>But now they're heading into a trap.</i>

495
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:03,414
<i>No star is safe in Stormhold.</i>

496
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:08,653
<i>The last to fall, 400 years ago,</i>

497
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:14,094
<i>was captured by the same witches
who seek Yvaine now.</i>

498
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,925
<i>They tricked her,</i>

499
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:19,957
<i>cared for her,</i>

500
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,899
<i>and when her heart
was once more aglow,</i>

501
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:28,875
<i>they cut it from her chest</i>

502
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,573
<i>and ate it.</i>

503
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,118
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

504
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,948
<i>A coach is coming.</i>

505
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,683
<i>By any means possible,
you must get on it.</i>

506
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:43,383
<i>Run.</i>

507
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:15,415
Whoa!

508
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,892
If Septimus insists on sending a boy
to do a mars job...

509
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:27,992
No, no, no, wait, please!

510
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,969
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.

511
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,870
Look at me, look at me.
I'm unarmed. Please.

512
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,368
Please, let me ride with you.

513
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,845
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

514
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:40,848
Well, then all the more reason
to take me with you.

515
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,442
There may come a time when you need
a second pair of hands. Sir?

516
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:48,182
Please. Maybe providence sent me
to you just as it sent you to me.

517
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,321
- Get on.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

518
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,947
Goodness me, my dear.
Come in out of this wretched rain!

519
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,622
We have food and drink, a warm bed
and plenty of hot water for a bath.

520
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:48,878
How do you like your bath?
Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?

521
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,013
I honestly don't know.

522
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,519
Then let me choose for you,

523
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,818
and I'll have my husband
take your horse to the stable.

524
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:57,918
Billy?

525
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:12,069
Now, let's get you out
of your wet things, shall we?

526
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,853
Feeling better?

527
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:26,683
Much. Thank you.

528
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,580
The warm water's actually done me
a world of good.

529
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:32,661
You see?
The powers of a nice, hot bath.

530
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,196
And your leg? Any improvement?

531
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,930
That is extraordinary.

532
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:43,166
It's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

533
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:45,137
You seem happier in yourself, too.

534
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:48,540
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

535
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:50,939
Wonderful.

536
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,942
Nothing like a nice soak
to warm the cockles of your heart.

537
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:06,258
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

538
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:09,854
but I've been told
I have a healer's hands.

539
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,434
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

540
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,459
What's a massage?

541
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,802
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

542
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:23,672
Nothing like a massage to send you off
for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

543
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,246
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

544
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,212
Lie on your back, dear.

545
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,220
Why not close your eyes?

546
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,655
You'll drift off better that way.

547
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,063
Hello!

548
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:54,164
Service!

549
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:56,801
Maybe we should carry on
and try the next inn,

550
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,642
especially if this stone is as close
as your runes say.

551
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,477
I'll give it one more try.

552
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,249
Relax here, my love.

553
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,723
I'll be back just as soon as
I've taken care of this customer.

554
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,265
At last. We require accommodation.

555
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,700
Please help my friend
take the horses to the stables.

556
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:36,810
Hello!

557
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:40,655
Oh.

558
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,929
I'm accustomed to better service,

559
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,908
but you're awake now
and that's what counts.

560
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,109
Prepare your best room.

561
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,271
- She got the stone.
- Stone, stone.

562
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:09,545
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.

563
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:11,176
Glass of wine?

564
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,481
No, no, no, no, no.

565
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,378
No.

566
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:19,384
Until my brother is dead,
I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

567
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,022
Though my friend in the stables
might be glad of a drop.

568
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:29,270
Your best room, perhaps?

569
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,204
Of course.

570
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,542
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

571
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:44,085
Traveling alone, are you?

572
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,955
I've just stabled my four black stallions
and my carriage.

573
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:52,186
Well, I say mine.
It belonged to my late father.

574
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,403
Thank you.

575
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:11,809
That's so kind, thank you very much.
My name's Tristan. What's yours?

576
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,142
Bernard.

577
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:24,084
There was not a horse or beast
he could not master.

578
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,923
So much so that in his youth,
he took to riding a camel,

579
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,394
which was comical.

580
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,590
When he passed,
the carriage came to me.

581
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,723
She's got the stone!

582
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:32,823
- She's got it!
- She's got it!

583
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:36,200
And it's the largest in all of Stormhold,
so they say.

584
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:39,069
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

585
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,266
Wait.

586
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:42,967
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

587
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,670
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

588
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,747
- Well done.
- Sweet.

589
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:46,837
Come here. Let me see it.

590
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,886
You have no idea
what you're meddling with.

591
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:07,799
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold
and I demand that you bring it to me!

592
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,393
Bring me the stone! Now!

593
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:12,633
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything
they give you! They tried to...

594
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,921
- Are you all right?
- Billy!

595
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:34,221
Get him!

596
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,235
The burning golden heart
of a star at peace

597
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:18,363
is so much better
than your frightened little heart.

598
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:22,410
Even so, better than no heart at all.

599
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,109
Yvaine?
Hold me tight and think of home.

600
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,952
No!

601
00:56:56,412 --> 00:57:00,815
- What the hell did you do?
- What did I do? What did you do?

602
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,817
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

603
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,978
You thought of your home
and I thought of mine

604
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,953
and now we're halfway between the two!

605
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:11,116
Oh, you stupid cow!
What did you think of your home for?

606
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:12,659
You just said "home"!

607
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:16,094
If you wanted me to think of your home,
you should have said!

608
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:18,632
Some crazy lady
was going to cut your heart out

609
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:20,463
and you wanted
more specific instructions?

610
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,970
Perhaps you'd like it in writing!
Or a diagram, maybe!

611
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:36,147
Look, Captain Shakespeare!
Caught ourselves a little bonus!

612
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,050
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

613
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:45,985
They don't look
like Lightning Marshals to me.

614
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:49,188
Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?

615
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:52,495
"Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?"

616
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,363
Well, let's think.

617
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,735
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason
we are!

618
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,032
Now, who are you?

619
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:05,141
Let's see if a night on our lovely brig
will loosen their lips!

620
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,182
- Get them in the brig!
- You heard the man! Let's go!

621
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:13,050
Get them into the brig and the rest of
you dirty dogs, back to work!

622
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:15,749
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

623
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:43,514
- They're going to kill us, aren't they?
- I don't know.

624
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:49,055
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

625
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:53,189
I used to watch people
having adventures.

626
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,787
I envied them.

627
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,269
You ever heard the expression,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

628
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,066
What? So ending up with my heart
cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

629
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:07,198
No. No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

630
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,338
Look, I admire you dreaming.

631
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:14,716
Shop boy like me,

632
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:16,716
I could never have imagined
an adventure this big

633
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:19,082
in order to have wished for it.

634
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,389
I just thought
I'd find some lump of celestial rock

635
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:25,085
and take it home, and that would be it.

636
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:26,524
And you got me.

637
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:38,863
If there's one thing I've learned
in all my years watching Earth,

638
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:41,772
it's that people aren't
what they may seem.

639
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:43,535
There are shop boys

640
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,911
and there are boys who just happen
to work in shops for the time being.

641
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:52,009
And trust me, Tristan,
you're no shop boy.

642
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,918
You saved my life. Thank you.

643
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:03,489
Well, well, well.

644
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:05,963
The last brother dead.

645
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,728
Which means that I'm king.

646
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:15,037
I'm king!

647
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,605
Not yet, brother.

648
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:23,077
Damn. I still need the stone.

649
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,085
- Your brother doesn't have it?
- Well, why don't you find out?

650
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,960
Where is my stone?

651
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,797
I don't...

652
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:44,804
The man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.

653
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:47,807
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

654
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,809
- What girl?
- I don't know.

655
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:52,607
A girl. She got away.
Because this was a trap set up for her,

656
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:55,774
but your brother,
he come just straight into it.

657
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,148
A trap? Set by who?

658
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:00,353
A woman you should pray
you'll never meet.

659
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:01,649
She's...

660
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:05,491
She's gone.
She took your brother's carriage.

661
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:07,687
This woman wanted my stone?

662
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:10,196
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

663
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,598
She said the girl was a star and
she wanted to cut out her heart and...

664
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,433
Eat it?

665
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,573
Oh, my God.

666
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:25,705
Do you have any idea what this means?

667
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:28,642
Everlasting life.

668
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,009
King forever.

669
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:37,716
It's not here, sire.

670
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,919
This idiot's coming with us.

671
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:06,411
- Ask again.
- We have asked again

672
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,819
and the answer is still the same.
She is airborne!

673
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:10,221
Well, she can't remain so forever.

674
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,293
Inform me
as soon as she touches ground!

675
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,294
Lmmediately! Do you understand?

676
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:17,957
Watch your tongue, sister!
It is you and not we who've lost her.

677
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,931
Lost her and broken the knife!

678
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:23,004
Even if you apprehend her,
how will you complete the deed?

679
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:26,472
Perhaps you should return now
and one of us set out in your place.

680
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,769
Don't be absurd.

681
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,743
I'll bring her home
and deal with her there.

682
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:33,713
Be sure everything is ready
for our arrival.

683
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:42,682
Tell me about Victoria then.

684
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:47,955
Well, she...

685
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:54,127
There's nothing more to tell you.

686
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:59,765
Because the little I know about love
is that it's unconditional.

687
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:02,909
It's not something you can buy.

688
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:05,878
Hang on.
This wasrt about me buying her love.

689
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:10,743
This was a way for me
to prove how I felt.

690
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,487
And what's she doing to prove
how she feels about you?

691
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:17,747
Well...

692
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,960
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand
when you meet her. All right?

693
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:29,524
Provided we don't get murdered
by pirates first.

694
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:35,665
Murdered by pirates.
Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

695
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:38,571
I can't quite decide
which sounds more fun.

696
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:43,342
We've located the sky vessel.

697
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:46,042
It's headed north
for the port town on Mount Drummond

698
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,483
and you are no longer
the only one seeking the star.

699
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:51,555
There's someone following your tracks!

700
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:53,749
A witch? A warlock?

701
01:03:53,858 --> 01:03:56,986
A prince and he's catching you up!
Get a move on!

702
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:30,792
So, this is the part where you tell me
who you are and why you're up here.

703
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:36,829
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers
one by one like dry twigs!

704
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:41,162
My name is Tristan Thorn.

705
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,997
- This is my wife, Yvaine.
- Your wife?

706
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:48,372
Far too young and radiant
to belong to just one man!

707
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:52,614
It's share and share alike
aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

708
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:55,141
If you dare even touch her...

709
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:57,949
You may think you're showing
a little spirit in front of your lady friend,

710
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:00,889
but if you talk back to me again,
I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

711
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:03,051
you impertinent little pup!

712
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:06,828
- Sir?
- Better! But still interrupting.

713
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:10,765
Let's see.
A hanging's always good for morale!

714
01:05:10,868 --> 01:05:13,359
Maybe we'll watch you dance
a gallows jig!

715
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,399
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side
and have done with it!

716
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,044
It's a very long way down.

717
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:25,547
Plenty of time to reminisce
about your pitifully short lives.

718
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,585
Please, look, we're just trying
to make our way home,

719
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,017
back to a place called Wall,
where I come from.

720
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:31,645
What did you say?

721
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,849
I said we were trying to get home
to Wall.

722
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,858
That's one lie too many, my son.

723
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,927
- Wall?
- Shut up.

724
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:37,995
What's he saying?

725
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,997
Thought you could just wander
onto my patch, did you?

726
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,532
- He is. Yeah, he's gonna...
- And live to tell the tale?

727
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:45,124
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck,
on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

728
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,673
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn!
And the last one you'll ever make!

729
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:59,815
- No! No! You brute!
- Come... Come on!

730
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:03,045
- You murderer! You pig!
- Come on! Get up! Get up!

731
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:06,753
I'm taking the girl to my cabin,
and mark my words,

732
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,587
anyone who disturbs me
for the next few hours

733
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,558
- will get the same treatment!
- What? You'll...

734
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:13,289
No, you idiot!
I'll sling you over the side as well!

735
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:14,659
Oh, yeah.

736
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:21,569
Captain's busy. So should you be.

737
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:24,970
Get in there, wench!

738
01:06:31,048 --> 01:06:33,676
So, that went well, I thought.

739
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:38,784
Now, tell me news
of my beloved England.

740
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:41,483
I want to hear absolutely everything.

741
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:45,785
Hang on.
I can't believe your crew fell for that.

742
01:06:45,896 --> 01:06:48,330
And where in God's name
did you get that mannequin from?

743
01:06:48,432 --> 01:06:50,127
Oh, it works every time.

744
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:52,464
An ounce of bargaining,
a pinch of trickery,

745
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:55,095
<i>a soupon of intimidation, et voil!</i>

746
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:57,299
The perfect recipe
for a towering reputation

747
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,876
without ever having to spill
one drop of blood.

748
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:03,378
Ever try to get blood stains out
of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

749
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:06,939
Right. I still don't understand
how they won't recognize me.

750
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:08,040
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

751
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:09,119
your own mother won't recognize you.

752
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,209
Now, we've no time to waste.

753
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,186
We have only two hours
before we make port.

754
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,984
First and foremost...

755
01:07:17,661 --> 01:07:21,256
It'll be so good to see you
out of those dreary clothes.

756
01:07:21,365 --> 01:07:24,630
So very small-town errand-boy.
Howlingly parochial.

757
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,565
<i>Here. Trs you.</i>

758
01:07:29,206 --> 01:07:31,868
I wore it as a younger man.
I hate to throw anything away.

759
01:07:31,976 --> 01:07:33,568
You know the day you do,
it'll come back in fashion,

760
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:35,577
<i>be oh, so de la mode.</i>

761
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,078
Now, you, darling.

762
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,876
I have some lovely dresses.
Take your pick.

763
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,450
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

764
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:42,917
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

765
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:48,552
Now, England, England.
I want to hear everything.

766
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:51,488
- You're not from England.
- Oh, no, sadly, no.

767
01:07:51,595 --> 01:07:53,893
But from my earliest youth,
I lapped up the stories.

768
01:07:53,998 --> 01:07:55,727
People always told me they were
nothing more than folklore,

769
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,324
but my heart told me they were true.

770
01:07:58,436 --> 01:08:00,631
As a boy, I'd scurry away
from my father at the market

771
01:08:00,738 --> 01:08:03,605
while he did his deals
just to peek over the wall,

772
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:06,699
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day,
seeing England for myself.

773
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:09,211
Really? So you...
You were here looking over there.

774
01:08:09,313 --> 01:08:10,541
Oh, yes.

775
01:08:12,082 --> 01:08:14,448
- Hair.
- Hair?

776
01:08:15,653 --> 01:08:17,951
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

777
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:20,319
Tried to make my father,
Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

778
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:22,824
Forged a decent reputation
as a ruthless marauder

779
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:24,895
and cold-blooded killer.

780
01:08:25,296 --> 01:08:27,025
But my father died.

781
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:30,027
I always promised him
I'd take over the family business,

782
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:32,102
keep the old girl flying.

783
01:08:33,137 --> 01:08:35,037
You have no idea the lightness
it brings to my heart

784
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:38,165
being able to confide in you
charming young people.

785
01:08:38,275 --> 01:08:40,607
The pressure of maintaining the
whole Captain Shakespeare persona

786
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:42,702
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

787
01:08:42,813 --> 01:08:44,337
Sometimes...

788
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:47,417
You see, I'm very much
a man of my own creation.

789
01:08:47,518 --> 01:08:50,385
Even chose the name specially.
Took me ages.

790
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:52,581
See, I'm thinking
legendary British wordsmith.

791
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:55,716
My enemies and crew are thinking,
"Shake! Spear!"

792
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,521
It's little things like that make me happy.

793
01:08:58,863 --> 01:09:00,922
I don't understand that.

794
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:03,829
Surely it would make you happier
just to be yourself.

795
01:09:03,934 --> 01:09:07,233
Why fight to be accepted by people
you don't actually want to be like?

796
01:09:07,338 --> 01:09:10,364
Yeah.
Why would anyone do that to himself?

797
01:09:11,675 --> 01:09:12,903
Exactly.

798
01:09:16,013 --> 01:09:19,847
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

799
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:34,893
Hurry up.

800
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:46,842
Yeah. Doesrt seem very fresh.
I'll be honest.

801
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:48,969
Shall I give you a little taste,
young Ferdinand?

802
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:50,842
No, no. Oh, there you go.

803
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,179
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

804
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:59,222
<i>I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still trs fresh.</i>

805
01:09:59,523 --> 01:10:02,117
- So, name your best price.
- For 10,000 bolts?

806
01:10:02,226 --> 01:10:04,660
Ten thousand bolts
of finest quality grade A.

807
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,629
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift,
isn't it? Difficult to store.

808
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:10,962
If I get the Revenue Men in here
sniffing round, what's the...

809
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:12,831
Best price, 150 guineas.

810
01:10:12,937 --> 01:10:15,269
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

811
01:10:15,372 --> 01:10:16,669
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

812
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:18,536
Hold on. Hold on. One minute.
Hold on, cuddles.

813
01:10:18,642 --> 01:10:20,507
- Oh, he's...
- One-sixty. One-sixty.

814
01:10:20,611 --> 01:10:22,545
Seeing as I'm feeling
particularly generous today,

815
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:23,908
I'll settle for 200.

816
01:10:24,014 --> 01:10:27,040
Two hundred? Okay.
You're having a laugh.

817
01:10:27,151 --> 01:10:28,413
Have you had your head in that?

818
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:31,579
Has he been sailing up
where the air's too thin?

819
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,684
- You're being very rude.
- Not anymore.

820
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,623
- Two hundred.
- One-eighty.

821
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:40,162
- Two hundred.
- That's not negotiation.

822
01:10:40,264 --> 01:10:42,562
I'm changing my number.
One-eight-five.

823
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:45,100
- Did I hear 200?
- From you, you did. Yeah.

824
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:48,000
- You said 200.
- Lf I did, you're a ventriloquist.

825
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:50,164
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

826
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:54,602
One-nine-five it is.
So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.

827
01:10:54,712 --> 01:10:56,907
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

828
01:10:57,314 --> 01:10:59,475
Unbelievable. Here.

829
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:06,684
Yes? Can I help you?

830
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:09,818
Nosy.

831
01:11:10,294 --> 01:11:13,525
Have you heard any of these rumors
going round about a fallen star?

832
01:11:13,631 --> 01:11:15,030
Everyone's talking about it.

833
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:18,431
You get your hands on one of them,
we can shut up shop. Retire.

834
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:20,230
- Fallen star?
- Yeah.

835
01:11:26,276 --> 01:11:27,971
- Nothing on your travels?
- No.

836
01:11:28,078 --> 01:11:29,306
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

837
01:11:29,413 --> 01:11:31,108
Everyone's going on about it
down at the market.

838
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:32,477
Which market?
The market near the wall?

839
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:33,550
Yeah.

840
01:11:33,651 --> 01:11:35,414
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time
listening to gossip

841
01:11:35,519 --> 01:11:37,453
from the kind of pond scum
trading down there.

842
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,886
- Well, if it...
- Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

843
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,719
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

844
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:44,123
Oh, what a wonderful woman
you are, Sal.

845
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:45,923
How the world wouldn't be
the same place without you.

846
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,691
You look great.
You've had your feet done, haven't you?

847
01:11:47,798 --> 01:11:51,894
But, you two, you have business
to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

848
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:54,698
Come on.
I've got something new for you.

849
01:12:01,378 --> 01:12:03,107
Captain Shakespeare.

850
01:12:03,514 --> 01:12:04,811
Stand down!

851
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:06,610
Meet my nephew,
the fearsome buccaneer,

852
01:12:06,717 --> 01:12:08,207
Tristan Thorn.

853
01:12:08,552 --> 01:12:11,077
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

854
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:14,589
I have the perfect gift
to keep you amused on the way.

855
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:22,489
Oh...

856
01:12:28,806 --> 01:12:30,273
Right, you lazy dogs!

857
01:12:30,374 --> 01:12:33,036
Let's get young Tristan
on his way home!

858
01:14:25,255 --> 01:14:26,449
Touch.

859
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:28,614
I'm impressed.

860
01:14:44,575 --> 01:14:46,668
Yvaine, I know what you are.

861
01:14:49,012 --> 01:14:52,004
No, no. Have no fear.

862
01:14:52,516 --> 01:14:56,680
No one on this vessel will harm you,
but there are plenty who would.

863
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:03,821
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine.
You must learn to control them.

864
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:06,225
You've been glowing
more brightly every day,

865
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,763
and I think you know why.

866
01:15:07,865 --> 01:15:10,629
Of course I know why I'm glowing.
I'm a star.

867
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:14,760
- And what do stars do best?
- Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

868
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:27,211
- Now try.
- Okay.

869
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,416
- See?
- Very good.

870
01:15:47,704 --> 01:15:49,103
Due west, you say?

871
01:15:49,206 --> 01:15:50,537
And you're certain
he had a girl with him?

872
01:15:50,641 --> 01:15:51,630
Yeah.

873
01:15:51,742 --> 01:15:55,041
You're sure? Absolutely sure?
Sure you're not lying?

874
01:15:55,545 --> 01:15:57,843
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

875
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:00,809
- Brilliant.
- You'd better be telling the truth,

876
01:16:00,918 --> 01:16:02,180
you two-faced dog.

877
01:16:02,286 --> 01:16:05,255
I can get you one of them, actually.
Very good guard dogs.

878
01:16:05,355 --> 01:16:07,516
They can watch the back
and the front door at the same time.

879
01:16:07,624 --> 01:16:08,591
I can get you anything you want.

880
01:16:08,692 --> 01:16:11,354
What are the chances of getting
a Babylon candle?

881
01:16:11,461 --> 01:16:12,894
That one's slim.

882
01:16:12,996 --> 01:16:17,456
Although, I did know a girl once,
if you know what I mean...

883
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:18,659
I'm a ladies' man.

884
01:16:18,769 --> 01:16:20,168
...who had a sister...

885
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,328
I think it was a woman.

886
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:25,169
Oh, she was terrible.
Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

887
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:26,469
Enough.

888
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,490
Hold on tight!
The Captain's at the helm!

889
01:17:39,016 --> 01:17:41,746
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

890
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:45,344
Good luck on your journey home,
Yvaine, wherever that may be.

891
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:48,424
And good luck to you, Tristan,
with your Victoria.

892
01:17:49,192 --> 01:17:51,023
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough
for your kindness?

893
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:54,723
Don't mention it.
No, seriously, don't mention it.

894
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:58,858
Reputations, you know.
A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

895
01:18:01,271 --> 01:18:04,206
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

896
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,140
Just think about it.

897
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:17,318
Well, give my regards to England.
It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

898
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:24,056
Mind you don't wear that wench out,
Captain Tristan!

899
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:30,665
What did he say to you?

900
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:32,829
What did he say when?

901
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:35,427
Just then. When he whispered to you.

902
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,340
No... No, he... He was just saying
we should use the lightning

903
01:18:39,443 --> 01:18:41,673
to get you a Babylon candle.

904
01:18:41,778 --> 01:18:43,712
Barter for it, you know.

905
01:18:44,915 --> 01:18:48,476
For the last time, where is the girl?

906
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:52,617
The girl with the stone!
Where did she go?

907
01:18:53,723 --> 01:18:55,850
- Are you mocking me?
- No...

908
01:18:55,959 --> 01:18:59,451
'Cause if you are, believe me,
you have seconds to live!

909
01:19:04,434 --> 01:19:05,867
What a freak.

910
01:19:06,203 --> 01:19:08,728
Clean this thoroughly.

911
01:19:16,947 --> 01:19:18,244
Bollocks.

912
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:23,213
If you have quite finished
squandering your magic

913
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,811
on your rather
counterproductive beauty routine,

914
01:19:25,922 --> 01:19:28,186
you might like to know that
the star has returned.

915
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,656
She's back on land.

916
01:19:29,759 --> 01:19:33,126
I know, damn it.
I couldn't reach the lake in time.

917
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,599
No matter. We have found her.
She is on the road to the village of Wall.

918
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:40,226
If you take the shortcut
across the marshes,

919
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:42,202
you should arrive in time
to intercept her.

920
01:19:51,181 --> 01:19:52,409
Yvaine.

921
01:19:56,253 --> 01:19:58,346
- Are you trying to break my leg again?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

922
01:19:58,455 --> 01:20:01,390
I just... I can't risk people seeing you.
I don't trust anyone.

923
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:03,152
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

924
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:08,220
Yvaine. We're making good time.
Just leave it a minute.

925
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:16,934
Arert you tempted?

926
01:20:20,043 --> 01:20:21,772
Tempted? By what?

927
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,979
Lmmortality.

928
01:20:26,016 --> 01:20:27,881
Let's say it wasrt my heart.

929
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:31,750
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

930
01:20:33,456 --> 01:20:36,152
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

931
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:44,632
I mean, even if I could...
Everlasting life?

932
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:49,330
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.

933
01:20:51,575 --> 01:20:52,667
Well,

934
01:20:54,477 --> 01:20:57,241
maybe if you had someone
to share it with.

935
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:00,007
Someone you love.

936
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:02,817
Maybe then it might be different.

937
01:21:06,022 --> 01:21:08,149
Come on, I think we're safe.

938
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,977
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare
has a fearsome reputation.

939
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:04,832
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

940
01:23:04,941 --> 01:23:07,034
My name is Prince Septimus.

941
01:23:08,278 --> 01:23:11,042
And you're going to tell me
where I can find the girl.

942
01:23:18,355 --> 01:23:23,759
All right, twinkletoes.
I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

943
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:44,774
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes.
I just noticed it. Is it normal?

944
01:23:44,881 --> 01:23:47,975
Let's see if you can work it out
for yourself.

945
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:49,881
What do stars do?

946
01:23:51,454 --> 01:23:53,081
Attract trouble?

947
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:57,489
That's... All right, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm sorry.

948
01:23:57,594 --> 01:23:59,152
All right, let me... Let me...
Do I get another guess?

949
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:04,357
Is it... Do they know exactly how
to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

950
01:24:08,638 --> 01:24:11,903
- How long will that take?
- Maybe two days.

951
01:24:12,008 --> 01:24:15,739
But we don't have two days.
Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

952
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:19,607
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

953
01:24:26,122 --> 01:24:28,784
- Nice cup of Earl Grey.
- Get out, everybody. Get out.

954
01:24:28,892 --> 01:24:30,860
Did he hurt you, Captain?

955
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:35,895
Did you tell him
where your nephew and the girl went?

956
01:24:36,966 --> 01:24:38,797
So what's the problem?

957
01:24:40,069 --> 01:24:41,764
It's my reputation.

958
01:24:43,273 --> 01:24:45,537
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

959
01:24:45,642 --> 01:24:47,473
It's all right, Captain.

960
01:24:48,211 --> 01:24:50,679
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

961
01:24:53,983 --> 01:24:57,680
- You'll always be our captain, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

962
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:04,126
Captain.

963
01:25:04,227 --> 01:25:06,218
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

964
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:15,268
Prince Septimus,
your men, they're dead.

965
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,736
Oh, really?

966
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:19,801
Go on!

967
01:25:32,922 --> 01:25:35,789
I met that woman.
She's friends with the Captain.

968
01:25:35,892 --> 01:25:37,587
He said she trades at the market
near Wall.

969
01:25:37,694 --> 01:25:39,685
- We could hitch a lift.
- Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

970
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:41,024
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

971
01:25:41,898 --> 01:25:45,664
Wait! Sorry!
My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

972
01:25:45,768 --> 01:25:47,395
That's my flower.

973
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:51,197
Eighteen years
I've been looking for that.

974
01:25:51,307 --> 01:25:52,934
Give it to me now!

975
01:25:53,676 --> 01:25:56,736
How dare you?
That was a gift from his mother!

976
01:25:56,846 --> 01:25:57,813
Oh.

977
01:25:58,381 --> 01:26:00,246
Perhaps I was mistaken.

978
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:03,075
It's all right.

979
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,713
It's obviously very valuable to you,
so you can have it

980
01:26:05,822 --> 01:26:07,346
in exchange for what I need.

981
01:26:07,457 --> 01:26:09,516
- A Babylon candle?
- And safe passage to the wall.

982
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:11,457
A Babylon candle?

983
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:15,497
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't deal in black magic.

984
01:26:15,598 --> 01:26:16,792
Really?

985
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:19,901
Well, can you give us a lift then?
To the wall?

986
01:26:20,003 --> 01:26:23,029
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

987
01:26:25,074 --> 01:26:27,838
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

988
01:26:28,111 --> 01:26:30,272
- Food and lodging on the way?
- Safe passage.

989
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,712
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

990
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:35,875
in the exact same condition
that you're in now.

991
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:44,085
Do you have any idea what
manner of thing it was that you had?

992
01:26:44,193 --> 01:26:46,184
Some kind of lucky charm?

993
01:26:46,663 --> 01:26:49,894
A very lucky charm indeed. Protection.

994
01:26:50,733 --> 01:26:55,500
In fact, the exact same thing that
would've prevented me from doing this.

995
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:02,605
- Oh, my God! What did you do?
- Much better.

996
01:27:02,712 --> 01:27:06,512
<i>You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.</i>

997
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:10,410
Though I'll keep me word.
You shall not be harmed.

998
01:27:19,362 --> 01:27:22,957
There.
Food and lodging just as I promised.

999
01:27:23,066 --> 01:27:27,196
Would I be correct in thinking that
you can neither see nor hear me?

1000
01:27:27,637 --> 01:27:30,333
Then I'd like to tell you
that you smell of pee.

1001
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,203
You look like the wrong end of a dog.

1002
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:34,776
And I swear,
if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1003
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:37,038
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1004
01:27:56,265 --> 01:27:57,459
Tristan?

1005
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:01,833
If you can understand me,
look at me now.

1006
01:28:30,366 --> 01:28:33,358
You know when I said
I knew little about love?

1007
01:28:35,104 --> 01:28:37,004
Well, that wasrt true.

1008
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:41,476
I know a lot about love.

1009
01:28:42,245 --> 01:28:45,681
I've seen it.
I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1010
01:28:47,483 --> 01:28:51,442
And it was the only thing that made
watching your world bearable.

1011
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:58,116
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1012
01:29:00,263 --> 01:29:03,562
Made me want to turn away
and never look down again.

1013
01:29:05,702 --> 01:29:09,502
But to see the way that mankind loves.

1014
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:13,437
I mean, you could search
the furthest reaches of the universe

1015
01:29:13,543 --> 01:29:16,376
and never find anything more beautiful.

1016
01:29:19,282 --> 01:29:24,686
So, yes, I know that
love is unconditional.

1017
01:29:26,322 --> 01:29:30,122
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1018
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:36,726
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1019
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:42,797
and, well,
strangely easy to mistake for loathing.

1020
01:29:43,573 --> 01:29:44,540
And

1021
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:51,312
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1022
01:29:52,982 --> 01:29:54,711
I think I love you.

1023
01:29:55,818 --> 01:30:01,518
My heart, it feels like
my chest can barely contain it.

1024
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,797
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore.
It belongs to you.

1025
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:14,565
And if you wanted it,
I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1026
01:30:15,872 --> 01:30:20,832
No gifts, no goods,
no demonstrations of devotion.

1027
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,474
Nothing but knowing you love me, too.

1028
01:30:28,417 --> 01:30:29,941
Just your heart

1029
01:30:32,021 --> 01:30:33,716
in exchange for mine.

1030
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,394
The wall is one mile that way.

1031
01:30:46,202 --> 01:30:49,899
There. Though the walk might take
you a little longer than normal.

1032
01:30:50,006 --> 01:30:54,102
Transformation tends to leave the brain
a bit scrambled for a while.

1033
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,911
You...

1034
01:30:59,148 --> 01:31:00,137
Oh!

1035
01:31:01,384 --> 01:31:03,750
I warned you. Save your strength.

1036
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,984
I've been so worried about you.

1037
01:31:07,657 --> 01:31:08,885
Victoria.

1038
01:31:09,926 --> 01:31:11,985
I think I preferred "Mother. "

1039
01:31:13,896 --> 01:31:18,458
Come on. There's an inn over there.
Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1040
01:31:19,502 --> 01:31:20,969
I think you need a bath
and a good night's sleep

1041
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,334
before you present me to her.

1042
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:25,066
Come on. Come.

1043
01:31:27,443 --> 01:31:30,344
- Come on, Tristan. It's not that far.
- Okay.

1044
01:31:51,868 --> 01:31:53,563
- Excuse me?
- Oh!

1045
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:56,900
- I think you're in my bath.
- Well, close your eyes!

1046
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:02,571
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking.
Here, I'll turn away.

1047
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:09,916
All right, you can open them now.

1048
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,788
Did you really mean
what you said in the caravan?

1049
01:32:22,832 --> 01:32:24,094
What I...

1050
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,226
But... But you were a mouse!

1051
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:30,833
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese!
You didn't...

1052
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,771
I asked you to give me a sign.

1053
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:37,039
And risk you being too embarrassed
to keep saying such lovely things?

1054
01:32:42,385 --> 01:32:45,946
You want to know what the Captain
really whispered to me that day?

1055
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:52,887
He told me that my true love
was right in front of my eyes.

1056
01:32:55,097 --> 01:32:56,724
And he was right.

1057
01:33:11,514 --> 01:33:14,415
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on,
you got to come up and see this!

1058
01:33:14,517 --> 01:33:15,950
No, thank you.

1059
01:33:16,686 --> 01:33:18,745
- Pervert!
- Suit yourself.

1060
01:33:20,723 --> 01:33:24,124
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Yeah. What is?

1061
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,819
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1062
01:33:26,929 --> 01:33:30,695
find the girl, get the stone
and be king forever.

1063
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,131
So unjust.

1064
01:33:32,735 --> 01:33:35,033
Still, at least we will be free.

1065
01:33:37,807 --> 01:33:41,140
You're very close.
She's in the market town.

1066
01:33:41,243 --> 01:33:43,541
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1067
01:33:43,646 --> 01:33:45,705
You speak as if this is good news.

1068
01:33:45,815 --> 01:33:49,751
Do I need to remind you that Wall
is not part of our universe?

1069
01:33:49,852 --> 01:33:52,412
If she crosses the threshold
into the human realm,

1070
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:56,548
our star becomes nothing more
than a pitted lump of metallic rock.

1071
01:33:57,059 --> 01:33:59,459
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1072
01:34:30,626 --> 01:34:31,786
What?

1073
01:34:32,795 --> 01:34:33,955
Oh, what do you want?

1074
01:34:34,063 --> 01:34:37,191
Sorry.
Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1075
01:34:37,299 --> 01:34:40,166
Ask me again
at a more reasonable hour.

1076
01:34:40,269 --> 01:34:41,361
No, I can't. I have to go.

1077
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:43,700
Look,
if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1078
01:34:43,806 --> 01:34:46,274
- please, can you give her a message?
- Go on.

1079
01:35:22,878 --> 01:35:26,507
You know, that's the first time
I've ever slept at night.

1080
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,545
I can't believe it.

1081
01:35:33,923 --> 01:35:34,912
Tristan?

1082
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,963
Have you seen my friend?

1083
01:35:46,068 --> 01:35:47,968
He left absurdly early.

1084
01:35:49,171 --> 01:35:50,399
He left?

1085
01:35:50,506 --> 01:35:53,737
He told me to tell you
he's gone to see Victoria

1086
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:56,744
because he's sorry,
but he's found his true love

1087
01:35:56,846 --> 01:35:59,974
and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her.

1088
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,142
What?

1089
01:36:03,152 --> 01:36:05,620
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

1090
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,917
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1091
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:23,020
Happy birthday.

1092
01:37:23,999 --> 01:37:25,296
Tristan.

1093
01:37:27,269 --> 01:37:29,032
What happened to you?

1094
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:32,066
I found the star.

1095
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:36,110
I can't believe you did it.

1096
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:38,680
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1097
01:37:39,815 --> 01:37:41,840
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes.

1098
01:37:44,086 --> 01:37:46,054
Well, it's awfully small.

1099
01:37:47,022 --> 01:37:50,048
Well, that's just a little piece.
A token for your birthday.

1100
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,957
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1101
01:37:54,263 --> 01:37:56,458
It's not the star that I want.

1102
01:37:58,901 --> 01:38:00,664
You know what I want.

1103
01:38:02,871 --> 01:38:04,702
Yeah. I do.

1104
01:38:09,979 --> 01:38:13,915
You want to grow up
and get over yourself.

1105
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:20,348
- Humphrey.
- Thorn.

1106
01:38:20,889 --> 01:38:22,982
You must have a death wish.

1107
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,798
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1108
01:38:34,436 --> 01:38:36,097
She's all yours.

1109
01:38:36,205 --> 01:38:38,765
You really are a perfect couple.
The best of luck to you both.

1110
01:38:38,874 --> 01:38:43,504
Well, why would I want this?
It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1111
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:50,177
Yvaine?

1112
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:54,255
She can't cross the wall.

1113
01:39:02,998 --> 01:39:04,022
Go on!

1114
01:40:11,533 --> 01:40:14,468
Stop! Stop!
If you go through there, you'll die!

1115
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,628
What?

1116
01:40:17,806 --> 01:40:21,003
If you set foot on human soil,
you'll turn to rock.

1117
01:40:21,577 --> 01:40:25,069
Wretched slattern!
Where have you taken me?

1118
01:40:34,423 --> 01:40:36,914
Planning to enter Wall, were you?

1119
01:40:37,025 --> 01:40:41,428
If death is what you wish, my dear,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1120
01:40:41,764 --> 01:40:43,664
Are you talking to me?

1121
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,027
You. Small world.

1122
01:40:47,035 --> 01:40:50,368
Anyhow, no, I wasrt.
I was talking to the star.

1123
01:40:50,873 --> 01:40:52,170
What star?

1124
01:40:53,709 --> 01:40:57,406
My slave girl's no star.
Any fool can see that.

1125
01:40:57,946 --> 01:41:00,574
If she was,
I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1126
01:41:00,682 --> 01:41:03,207
a long time ago, trust me.

1127
01:41:03,619 --> 01:41:07,020
Trust you? Not a mistake
I'd be likely to make again.

1128
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:11,090
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal?
Heads or tails?

1129
01:41:41,123 --> 01:41:45,184
- Oh, God. Time to go.
- She's not going anywhere.

1130
01:41:45,327 --> 01:41:47,192
I think you'll find she is.

1131
01:41:47,296 --> 01:41:49,662
It's all right. You can come, too.

1132
01:41:52,568 --> 01:41:56,629
You can ride in the carriage or
be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1133
01:42:16,525 --> 01:42:17,822
What happened?

1134
01:42:17,926 --> 01:42:20,258
Be my guest. I quit.

1135
01:42:20,362 --> 01:42:23,354
Eighty years
I've stopped you people going out.

1136
01:42:23,465 --> 01:42:25,330
What I should have been worrying about

1137
01:42:25,434 --> 01:42:26,924
was those people
from the other side coming in.

1138
01:42:27,035 --> 01:42:28,696
All right,
just tell me what happened!

1139
01:42:28,804 --> 01:42:30,669
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1140
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,007
No!

1141
01:42:47,022 --> 01:42:48,216
Come on!

1142
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,246
Go on!

1143
01:43:49,885 --> 01:43:51,113
The star!

1144
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,687
And who else?

1145
01:43:52,788 --> 01:43:55,916
A slave for us. It will be nice to
have someone to help mop up

1146
01:43:56,024 --> 01:43:58,219
when we've finished with our little guest.

1147
01:43:58,327 --> 01:43:59,726
Oh, good work, sister.

1148
01:43:59,828 --> 01:44:02,729
And just in time, I see! You look awful!

1149
01:45:01,757 --> 01:45:03,156
Who are you?

1150
01:45:04,459 --> 01:45:06,757
What business do you have here?

1151
01:45:08,196 --> 01:45:09,458
Septimus?

1152
01:45:09,998 --> 01:45:12,091
I knew your brother, Primus.

1153
01:45:13,435 --> 01:45:15,960
Unless you wish to meet him
in the afterlife,

1154
01:45:16,071 --> 01:45:18,733
I suggest you answer my question.
What are you doing here?

1155
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,138
I might ask you the same thing.

1156
01:45:37,893 --> 01:45:39,758
There are four of them.

1157
01:45:42,731 --> 01:45:45,461
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1158
01:45:45,567 --> 01:45:48,058
Wait.
How do I know you can be trusted?

1159
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:50,764
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1160
01:45:50,872 --> 01:45:52,863
- No.
- Well, then, let's go.

1161
01:46:00,282 --> 01:46:03,877
Get off me! Get off!

1162
01:46:08,123 --> 01:46:10,318
- Una?
- Septimus.

1163
01:46:10,425 --> 01:46:11,892
- Una!
- Sister!

1164
01:46:30,645 --> 01:46:32,510
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1165
01:46:33,749 --> 01:46:36,445
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1166
01:46:37,686 --> 01:46:39,244
I'm your mother.

1167
01:47:15,957 --> 01:47:18,551
- Rather well.
- Good riddance to you. Yes.

1168
01:47:44,152 --> 01:47:45,119
Oh!

1169
01:47:58,166 --> 01:48:00,361
Let's put out those flames.

1170
01:48:00,802 --> 01:48:02,099
Shall we?

1171
01:48:52,821 --> 01:48:54,686
So, what happens now?

1172
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,890
We have to learn to live with each other.

1173
01:48:57,993 --> 01:48:59,187
Forever?

1174
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:06,462
Let's get on with it.

1175
01:49:10,405 --> 01:49:12,396
Be the man that I know you are.

1176
01:49:30,191 --> 01:49:31,488
- Get outside.
- Okay.

1177
01:49:31,593 --> 01:49:32,582
Go.

1178
01:49:42,771 --> 01:49:44,636
- Tristan!
- Get him.

1179
01:50:20,308 --> 01:50:21,570
Get off!

1180
01:50:25,714 --> 01:50:27,443
Get out!

1181
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:09,079
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming?
Frog or tadpole?

1182
01:52:07,148 --> 01:52:08,376
Septimus?

1183
01:53:30,498 --> 01:53:31,658
Tristan!

1184
01:54:15,476 --> 01:54:16,773
Youth.

1185
01:54:17,712 --> 01:54:19,009
Beauty.

1186
01:54:20,815 --> 01:54:23,249
It all seems meaningless now.

1187
01:54:23,952 --> 01:54:25,920
My sisters are dead!

1188
01:54:27,555 --> 01:54:31,218
Everything I cared about gone.

1189
01:54:37,398 --> 01:54:38,490
Go.

1190
01:54:43,972 --> 01:54:45,269
Go!

1191
01:55:06,294 --> 01:55:07,261
No!

1192
01:56:04,385 --> 01:56:06,319
I owe you thanks, boy.

1193
01:56:06,754 --> 01:56:09,848
What use was her heart to me
when it was broken?

1194
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:15,194
And you got rid of my sisters
and now I can have it all for myself.

1195
01:56:21,069 --> 01:56:24,095
- Hold me tight and close your eyes.
- What? Why?

1196
01:56:24,872 --> 01:56:26,499
What do stars do?

1197
01:56:33,314 --> 01:56:34,474
Shine.

1198
01:57:10,718 --> 01:57:12,379
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

1199
01:57:12,787 --> 01:57:14,084
Very good.

1200
01:57:15,857 --> 01:57:17,381
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1201
01:57:17,492 --> 01:57:22,122
I couldn't have done that without you.
No star can shine with a broken heart.

1202
01:57:23,531 --> 01:57:25,396
I thought I'd lost you.

1203
01:57:26,667 --> 01:57:28,464
But you came back.

1204
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:31,168
Of course I did. I love you.

1205
01:57:36,744 --> 01:57:37,972
Come on.

1206
01:57:58,065 --> 01:57:59,362
Tristan.

1207
01:58:02,103 --> 01:58:05,595
The last surviving male heir
of the Stormhold bloodline.

1208
01:58:08,376 --> 01:58:10,003
It's you, Tristan.

1209
01:58:13,881 --> 01:58:16,873
But if he's the new King of Stormhold,
then...

1210
01:59:03,965 --> 01:59:08,459
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1211
01:59:25,853 --> 01:59:27,252
Yeah!

1212
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:44,797
My gift to you.

1213
01:59:46,607 --> 01:59:48,006
To you both.

1214
01:59:48,309 --> 01:59:49,640
Thank you.

1215
02:00:04,592 --> 02:00:07,152
<i>They ruled for 80 years.</i>

1216
02:00:08,396 --> 02:00:11,331
<i>But no man can live forever,</i>

1217
02:00:12,233 --> 02:00:15,634
<i>except he who possesses
the heart of a star.</i>

1218
02:00:16,537 --> 02:00:20,940
<i>And Yvaine had given hers
to Tristan completely.</i>

1219
02:00:22,510 --> 02:00:25,809
<i>When their children and
grandchildren were grown,</i>

1220
02:00:26,847 --> 02:00:30,078
<i>it was time to light the Babylon candle.</i>

1221
02:00:36,157 --> 02:00:40,594
<i>And they still live happily ever after.</i>
