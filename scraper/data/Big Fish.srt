1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,892
<i>There are some fish
that cannot be caught.</i>

2
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,063
<i>It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.</i>

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>They're just touched
by something extra.</i>

4
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>One such fish was The Beast.</i>

5
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.</i>

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>He'd passed up more $100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.</i>

7
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,002
<i>Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...</i>

8
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,380
<i>... who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.</i>

9
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:35,595
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

10
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,599
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,477
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

12
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,104
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

13
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,107
And on the day you were born...

14
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,277
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

15
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,947
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

16
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,951
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

17
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,787
But on that day I had a revelation:

18
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:06,792
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

19
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,213
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

20
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,800
- Your finger?
- Gold.

21
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,846
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

22
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:23,267
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

23
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:27,188
And then I cast upriver.

24
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,528
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

25
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:39,158
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

26
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,993
Well, you can see my predicament.

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,164
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

28
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:48,083
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,170
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

30
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:53,005
What did you do?

31
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,467
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

32
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,596
This fish, The Beast...

33
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:06,727
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

34
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,187
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

35
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:12,065
Now, I was in a situation.

36
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:15,861
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

37
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:21,283
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,869
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

39
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,080
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

40
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,875
This ladyfish and I...

41
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,546
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

42
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,757
Now, you may well ask...

43
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:41,678
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

44
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:47,726
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

45
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:51,021
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

46
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,232
...the day my son was born.

47
00:03:54,399 --> 00:04:00,447
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

48
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:04,159
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

49
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:15,295
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,255
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

51
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:23,428
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

52
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,764
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

53
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,517
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

54
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:34,063
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

55
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,151
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

56
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:41,612
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

57
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:44,949
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

58
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:49,370
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

59
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:53,457
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

60
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:59,630
<i>After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.</i>

61
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:09,181
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...

62
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:15,479
<i>We communicated indirectly, I guess.</i>

63
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:19,650
<i>In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.</i>

64
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:24,905
<i>And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.</i>

65
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,117
<i>True to form, we never
talk ed about not talking.</i>

66
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:34,832
<i>The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.</i>

67
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,335
<i>And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.</i>

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,467
<i>We were lik e strangers
who knew each other very well.</i>

69
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,933
<i>In telling the story
of my father's life...</i>

70
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:57,604
<i>... it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.</i>

71
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,236
<i>The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.</i>

72
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:09,449
<i>It doesn't always mak e sense,
and most of it never happened.</i>

73
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,185
Give me back my ring!

74
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,116
Thank you!

75
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,619
<i>But that's what kind of story this is.</i>

76
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,923
<i>His birth would set the pace
for his unlik ely life.</i>

77
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,135
<i>No longer than most men's,
but larger.</i>

78
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:12,679
<i>And as strange as his stories got...</i>

79
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:16,391
<i>... the endings were always
the most surprising of all.</i>

80
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,878
Yes. Yes, he's here.

81
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,756
It's your mother.

82
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,598
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

83
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,811
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

84
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,814
Yeah, I'll wait.

85
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,482
It's bad?

86
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,778
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

87
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:14,699
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

88
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:19,078
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

89
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,038
I'm going with you.

90
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,194
Now, which one's it gonna be?

91
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:55,239
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

92
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,074
The one about the witch.

93
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:57,574
The one about the witch.

94
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,576
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

95
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,536
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

96
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:04,581
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

97
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,877
Well, neither was I, at first.

98
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,297
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

99
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:17,135
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

100
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:21,932
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

101
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,351
There were five of us
out there that night:

102
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:28,355
<i>Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...</i>

103
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:32,192
<i>... and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.</i>

104
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:36,196
<i>And not one of us knew
what was in store.</i>

105
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:40,992
<i>It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...</i>

106
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,328
<i>... if only to eat
misbehaving children...</i>

107
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,706
<i>... and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.</i>

108
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:50,043
<i>Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...</i>

109
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,587
<i>... and mak e the land infertile.</i>

110
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:56,925
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

111
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,302
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

112
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,762
Your momma's a bitch.

113
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,139
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

114
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,557
- Shit.
- Damn.

115
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:05,767
Screw.

116
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,061
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

117
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,855
<i>Yet of all the witches in Alabama...</i>

118
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,942
<i>... there was one who was said
to be the most feared.</i>

119
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:18,196
<i>For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.</i>

120
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:22,242
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

121
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:26,121
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

122
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,331
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

123
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:33,169
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

124
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,463
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

125
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,715
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

126
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,843
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

127
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,304
Edward, don't!

128
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:47,392
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

129
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:50,269
She makes soap out of people.

130
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,363
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

131
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,241
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

132
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,339
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

133
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,632
Let's see it.

134
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,181
Whoa, help!

135
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:23,320
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

136
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:26,490
I wasn't old at all.

137
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,584
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

138
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,296
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

139
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,298
...it could kind of screw you up.

140
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:47,177
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

141
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:51,473
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

142
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,354
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

143
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,867
That's how I go.

144
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,557
Hi, Mom.

145
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:45,693
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

146
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:49,614
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

147
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:53,826
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

148
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:56,079
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

149
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:01,125
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

150
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,002
Not yet.

151
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,172
Will.

152
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,259
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

153
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:13,012
My wife, Josephine.

154
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:15,223
A pleasure.

155
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:19,560
- You're seven months.
- To the day!

156
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,855
It's a boy.

157
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:31,238
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

158
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,368
Dad?

159
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,965
You want some water?

160
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,652
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

161
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:55,781
Having a kid changes everything.

162
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:59,659
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

163
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:02,871
- Did you do any of that?
- No.

164
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:05,457
But I hear it's terrible.

165
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:11,129
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child...

166
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:16,092
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

167
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:21,222
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

168
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,979
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

169
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,689
Everyone wins.

170
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:34,152
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

171
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,279
This is not how I go.

172
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:40,700
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

173
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,662
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

174
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,457
No, she was old and probably senile.

175
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:52,837
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

176
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,048
So how does it happen?

177
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:59,761
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

178
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,806
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

179
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,768
Look at us. We're talking fine.

180
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,811
We're storytellers, both of us.

181
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,484
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

182
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,570
Dad...

183
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,992
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

184
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,411
You mean while I'm here.

185
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,540
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

186
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,585
Events. Stories.

187
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,045
You.

188
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,392
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

189
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,229
- Lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

190
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:55,649
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

191
00:17:55,858 --> 00:18:01,822
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

192
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,117
And this here, being stuck in bed...

193
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,746
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

194
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:15,419
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

195
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:19,423
The last part is much more unusual.

196
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,925
Trust me on that.

197
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,794
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

198
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,673
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

199
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,135
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

200
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:27,324
<i>Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.</i>

201
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,160
<i>Most times a person
grows up gradually...</i>

202
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,704
<i>... while I found myself in a hurry.</i>

203
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:40,086
<i>My muscles and my bones couldn't
k eep up with my body's ambition.</i>

204
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:43,756
<i>So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...</i>

205
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:47,886
<i>... with the encyclopaedia being
my only means of exploration.</i>

206
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,054
<i>I had made it all the way to the G's...</i>

207
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,099
<i>... hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...</i>

208
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:57,103
<i>... when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.</i>

209
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:01,232
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

210
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,692
With more space...

211
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:06,696
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

212
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:10,116
<i>It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...</i>

213
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:12,827
<i>... was that I was intended
for larger things.</i>

214
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,581
<i>After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.</i>

215
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:21,377
<i>As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...</i>

216
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:26,340
<i>... I set upon my plan to mak e
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.</i>

217
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:27,800
<i>Tigers, go!</i>

218
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,026
Edward Bloom!

219
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:31,905
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggie's trapped!

220
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:44,126
<i>I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.</i>

221
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,921
<i>Until one day, a stranger arrived.</i>

222
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:07,816
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

223
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:11,778
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

224
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,531
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

225
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:17,784
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

226
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:19,828
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

227
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,706
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

228
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:24,666
I'll do it.

229
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:41,641
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

230
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:44,227
That creature could crush you
without trying.

231
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:47,397
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

232
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,388
Hello?

233
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:28,020
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

234
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:31,190
Go away!

235
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:36,153
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

236
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,323
I said, go away!

237
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,096
<i>Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...</i>

238
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:04,473
<i>... I knew the giant couldn't kill me.</i>

239
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:10,020
<i>All the same, I preferred to k eep
my bones unbrok en.</i>

240
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:12,189
Why are you here?

241
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:14,984
So you can eat me.

242
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:19,405
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

243
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:23,200
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

244
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,578
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

245
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,791
So I guess, well...

246
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:35,295
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

247
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:51,478
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

248
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:54,147
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

249
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:56,900
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

250
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:58,777
Here.

251
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:02,322
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

252
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:06,702
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

253
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:10,997
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

254
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:14,960
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

255
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,212
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

256
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:20,257
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

257
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:22,676
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

258
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:25,345
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

259
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:27,639
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

260
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:30,809
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

261
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,853
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

262
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:37,190
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

263
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:40,527
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

264
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,406
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

265
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:47,951
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

266
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:51,955
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

267
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:54,916
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

268
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,169
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

269
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:01,548
So, what do you say? Join me?

270
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,927
Okay.

271
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,805
Okay.

272
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:12,225
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

273
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:33,287
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

274
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:36,916
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

275
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,752
But take with you
this key to the city...

276
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,880
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

277
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:46,092
...all our doors are open to you.

278
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:58,687
<i>That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.</i>

279
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:01,732
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

280
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:05,152
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

281
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,698
<i>But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.</i>

282
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:16,497
<i>She said that the biggest fish
in the river...</i>

283
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:19,833
<i>... gets that way
by never being caught.</i>

284
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:27,758
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

285
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:41,647
<i>There were two roads out of Ashton:</i>

286
00:27:41,814 --> 00:27:44,691
<i>A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.</i>

287
00:27:44,858 --> 00:27:46,819
<i>People didn't use
the old one anymore...</i>

288
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:49,863
<i>... and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.</i>

289
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,158
<i>Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...</i>

290
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:57,496
<i>... this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.</i>

291
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:02,417
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

292
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:05,337
He was going to Paris, France.

293
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,007
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

294
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,343
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

295
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,097
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

296
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:19,392
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

297
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:22,354
Here.

298
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:26,691
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

299
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,899
Why, you son of a...

300
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:36,469
<i>Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...</i>

301
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:41,349
<i>... will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistak e.</i>

302
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:46,437
<i>The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.</i>

303
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,316
<i>And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...</i>

304
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:55,613
<i>... the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.</i>

305
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,633
Friend! Welcome to you!

306
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:01,094
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

307
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:05,307
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.

308
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:09,603
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

309
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,147
We weren't expecting you yet.

310
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:14,399
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

311
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:19,237
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

312
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:23,867
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

313
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,162
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

314
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,248
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

315
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:31,708
What is this place?

316
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,086
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

317
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:38,673
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

318
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,177
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

319
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,220
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

320
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:48,808
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

321
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:50,935
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

322
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:54,230
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

323
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:58,276
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

324
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,938
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

325
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,815
It truly is.

326
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:46,073
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

327
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,787
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

328
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,499
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

329
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:59,086
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

330
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,050
Hey! Jenny!

331
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,844
Come back here!

332
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,976
Jenny!

333
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,327
Hey, I need those.

334
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,205
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

335
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,875
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

336
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,923
<i>I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...</i>

337
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,970
<i>... the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.</i>

338
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:56,435
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

339
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,228
Really?

340
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:03,192
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

341
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,694
May I?

342
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:27,674
It's only three lines long.

343
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:34,264
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

344
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,904
I got him!

345
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:49,172
There's leeches in there.

346
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:53,176
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

347
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:56,762
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

348
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,683
Yes, she was.

349
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:05,062
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

350
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,773
Fish looks different
to different people.

351
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,861
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

352
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,780
...back from the dead.

353
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,035
Oh, darn.

354
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:24,206
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

355
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:28,294
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

356
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:33,215
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

357
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:37,845
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

358
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:40,848
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

359
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:17,217
Hey, Edward!

360
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:30,188
<i>Roses are red
Violets are blue</i>

361
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:32,858
<i>I love Spectre...</i>

362
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,574
Excuse me.

363
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:50,250
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

364
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,419
What?

365
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:55,797
I said, you're quite a catch.

366
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:19,821
I have to leave.

367
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,243
Tonight.

368
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,995
Why?

369
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,832
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

370
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,544
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

371
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:38,673
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

372
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:40,925
But no one's ever left.

373
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:45,513
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

374
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,349
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

375
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:54,939
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

376
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:02,238
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

377
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:09,412
Promise me you'll come back.

378
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:15,668
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

379
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:49,535
<i>That night,
I reached two conclusions.</i>

380
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:55,332
<i>The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.</i>

381
00:39:55,541 --> 00:40:00,212
<i>The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrev ocably lost.</i>

382
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,841
<i>These woods would become
my graveyard.</i>

383
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:10,973
<i>As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.</i>

384
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,518
<i>After all, no man can av oid
reaching the end of his life.</i>

385
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,453
<i>And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.</i>

386
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,623
This isn't how I die.

387
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,433
Friend.

388
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:59,521
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

389
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:19,499
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

390
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,251
<i>...in the most recent Newsweek.</i>

391
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:25,296
Really?

392
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,756
That's just wonderful.

393
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:33,096
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

394
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:37,767
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

395
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:51,197
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

396
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:56,828
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

397
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,163
Really?

398
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:03,084
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

399
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:06,170
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

400
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:10,049
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

401
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:15,846
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

402
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,724
Everything but religion.

403
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,185
Why not religion, Dad?

404
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:26,565
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

405
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:35,032
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

406
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,786
Oh, so you know.

407
00:42:54,426 --> 00:42:56,887
Hello.

408
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,390
Hi. How are you feeling?

409
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:03,686
Oh, I was dreaming.

410
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:06,730
What were you dreaming about?

411
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:10,818
Oh, I don't usually remember...

412
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:15,364
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

413
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:18,742
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

414
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,995
Like one night, I had a dream...

415
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:26,917
...where this crow came and said:

416
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,628
"Your aunt is gonna die."

417
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:34,049
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

418
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:38,428
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

419
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:42,140
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

420
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:44,434
That's terrible.

421
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:49,773
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

422
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:55,070
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

423
00:43:55,237 --> 00:43:59,950
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

424
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:02,786
I didn't know what to do.

425
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:06,831
I finally told my father, but he said:

426
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,837
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

427
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:15,882
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

428
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:20,678
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

429
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:25,892
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

430
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:28,311
"Your daddy's gonna die."

431
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:34,859
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

432
00:44:35,026 --> 00:44:37,737
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

433
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:41,157
...like he was waiting
for the axe to fall all day.

434
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,993
He said to my mother:

435
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,914
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

436
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:52,085
"You think you've had a bad day?"
She said.

437
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:57,382
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

438
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,679
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

439
00:45:05,556 --> 00:45:10,228
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

440
00:45:10,394 --> 00:45:14,565
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

441
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:16,025
Please?

442
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:19,153
All right.

443
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,659
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

444
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:27,203
There is a great one
of you and my father.

445
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:38,214
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

446
00:45:38,422 --> 00:45:41,842
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

447
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:45,429
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

448
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:49,433
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

449
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,186
Will never told you?

450
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:55,231
Probably just as well.

451
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:58,025
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

452
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:01,403
All the facts, none of the flavour.

453
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:05,240
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

454
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:09,578
Well, it's not a short one.

455
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,083
<i>I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.</i>

456
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:14,625
<i>I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.</i>

457
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,334
<i>I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.</i>

458
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:16,960
<i>I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.</i>

459
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,922
<i>Not knowing what
that would be exactly...</i>

460
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:25,010
<i>... I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.</i>

461
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:58,168
Coco! Coco! There they are.

462
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:02,839
Ladies and gentlemen!

463
00:47:02,964 --> 00:47:06,760
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

464
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:11,932
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

465
00:47:13,224 --> 00:47:18,063
But I've travelled
to the five corners of the world...

466
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,986
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

467
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:32,410
When I met this man...

468
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:35,330
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

469
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:39,542
<i>His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."</i>

470
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:43,838
Because when you worked
beside him...

471
00:47:44,422 --> 00:47:46,674
...he blocked out the daylight!

472
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:51,471
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

473
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:56,100
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

474
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:59,771
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

475
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:02,565
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

476
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:04,859
...he will not hurt her...

477
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:08,738
...because he is our own gentle giant.

478
00:48:10,072 --> 00:48:16,204
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

479
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:44,416
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

480
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,918
...thank y'all for coming.

481
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:50,672
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

482
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:54,843
<i>It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.</i>

483
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:58,513
<i>And I met mine, almost.</i>

484
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,518
<i>They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.</i>

485
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:05,145
<i>And that's true.</i>

486
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:53,526
<i>What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...</i>

487
00:50:54,193 --> 00:50:57,989
<i>... it moves extra fast to catch up.</i>

488
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,273
What's your name?

489
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,486
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

490
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:48,497
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

491
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:51,542
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

492
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,589
- Nope.
- Great.

493
00:51:56,755 --> 00:51:58,799
Here you go.

494
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,635
Here you are.

495
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:07,641
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

496
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:10,144
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

497
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:25,159
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

498
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:28,370
Hey, kid.

499
00:52:28,537 --> 00:52:31,874
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

500
00:52:34,209 --> 00:52:36,879
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

501
00:52:37,004 --> 00:52:38,714
Pleased to meet you.

502
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:46,930
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

503
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,309
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

504
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,770
"Depressed"?

505
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:57,816
See? The big guy likes it.

506
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,694
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

507
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,989
I know it. But I lost her.

508
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:06,408
Oh, tough break.

509
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:10,412
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

510
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,667
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

511
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:17,961
Damn, kid.

512
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:23,550
Let me guess. Real pretty?

513
00:53:24,884 --> 00:53:26,720
Reddish-blondish hair?

514
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:29,889
Blue dress?

515
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:32,851
Yeah!

516
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:36,020
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

517
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:38,356
Who is she? Where does she live?

518
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:41,401
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

519
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:45,071
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

520
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:49,701
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

521
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:51,786
You don't have a plan or a job.

522
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:54,372
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

523
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:57,792
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

524
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:01,713
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

525
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:06,384
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

526
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:09,178
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

527
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:12,724
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

528
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:16,561
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

529
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:20,773
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

530
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,984
And I may not have much...

531
00:54:23,192 --> 00:54:26,863
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

532
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:32,785
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

533
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:36,122
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

534
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,124
...and you won't have to pay me.

535
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:43,129
You just have to tell me who she is.

536
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,634
Every month you work for me...

537
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:52,221
...l'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

538
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:58,352
Let's get started.

539
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:15,452
<i>From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway ask ed.</i>

540
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:18,706
<i>I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.</i>

541
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:21,500
<i>And four days without sleeping.</i>

542
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:24,545
<i>What k ept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...</i>

543
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:25,963
<i>... who would be my wife.</i>

544
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,140
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

545
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:40,144
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

546
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:42,145
It's been a month today.

547
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:47,317
This girl, the love of your life...

548
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:52,447
...her favourite flowers are daffodils.

549
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:57,828
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

550
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:00,956
Daffodils.

551
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:04,751
Daffodils.

552
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:12,425
<i>True to his word...</i>

553
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:15,387
<i>...every month Amos would tell me
something new...</i>

554
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:17,848
<i>... about the woman of my dreams.</i>

555
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:20,976
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

556
00:56:21,184 --> 00:56:22,686
She's going to college.

557
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:27,357
College. She's going to college.

558
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:39,369
She likes music.

559
00:56:40,078 --> 00:56:43,832
Music. She likes music.

560
00:56:48,086 --> 00:56:50,213
<i>Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...</i>

561
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:50,755
<i>Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...</i>

562
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,257
<i>Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...</i>

563
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,717
<i>... but not her name,
and not where to find her.</i>

564
00:56:54,717 --> 00:56:55,426
<i>... but not her name,
and not where to find her.</i>

565
00:56:56,052 --> 00:57:00,765
<i>That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.</i>

566
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,404
Mr. Calloway?

567
00:57:16,447 --> 00:57:19,742
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

568
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:26,415
Mr. Calloway?

569
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,575
No. Wait!

570
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:24,264
<i>That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wick ed...</i>

571
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:28,310
<i>... are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.</i>

572
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:04,888
Didn't kill anything, did I?

573
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:10,310
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

574
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:16,566
That would explain the indigestion.

575
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:25,659
Thank you.

576
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:29,829
I was wrong about you, kid.

577
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:33,416
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

578
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,211
You could get any girl.

579
00:59:36,378 --> 00:59:38,380
There's only one I want.

580
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:44,427
Her name...

581
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,933
...is Sandra Templeton.

582
00:59:52,018 --> 00:59:54,687
She goes to Auburn.

583
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:59,442
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

584
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:01,361
Thank you. Thank you.

585
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:04,447
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

586
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,587
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

587
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:24,384
<i>After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...</i>

588
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,970
<i>... to get to Auburn that afternoon.</i>

589
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,801
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

590
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,344
...and I love you.

591
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:13,974
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

592
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:18,479
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

593
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:21,941
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

594
01:01:22,107 --> 01:01:25,069
...and to finally get to talk to you.

595
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:27,571
Because I'm destined to marry you.

596
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:33,827
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

597
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:39,375
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

598
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,835
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

599
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:45,214
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

600
01:01:52,387 --> 01:01:55,557
But you're wrong. I do know you.

601
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:57,684
At least by reputation.

602
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:00,979
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

603
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:05,901
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

604
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,154
He was a few years older than you.

605
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,666
Well...

606
01:02:23,794 --> 01:02:25,337
Congratulations.

607
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,092
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

608
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:39,142
Stop it! It's not funny.

609
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:42,312
That poor boy.

610
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:46,107
<i>Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.</i>

611
01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:48,360
<i>After all this work to leave Ashton...</i>

612
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:53,990
<i>... the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.</i>

613
01:02:54,157 --> 01:02:56,409
<i>There's a time when a man
needs to fight...</i>

614
01:02:56,576 --> 01:03:00,038
<i>... and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...</i>

615
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:04,250
<i>... the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.</i>

616
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:07,795
<i>Truth is, I've always been a fool.</i>

617
01:03:08,796 --> 01:03:13,760
Sandra Templeton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

618
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:21,476
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life...

619
01:03:22,143 --> 01:03:24,896
...supply and demand
makes much more sense.

620
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:29,108
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger...

621
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,828
- for three hours.

622
01:03:41,037 --> 01:03:42,872
Look!

623
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:16,655
- Daffodils!
- They're your favourite flower.

624
01:04:16,864 --> 01:04:18,282
How did you get so many?

625
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:21,160
I called everywhere in five states.

626
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:24,288
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

627
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:28,208
You don't even know me.

628
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:31,295
I have the rest of my life to find out.

629
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:34,089
Sandra!

630
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:38,552
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

631
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:41,638
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

632
01:04:42,056 --> 01:04:44,516
- Bloom?
- Don.

633
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:49,646
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

634
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:52,399
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

635
01:04:55,694 --> 01:04:58,697
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

636
01:04:58,864 --> 01:05:00,532
I promised I wouldn't.

637
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:04,036
Stop it!

638
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:05,829
Don, stop!

639
01:05:05,996 --> 01:05:11,418
<i>While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.</i>

640
01:05:11,585 --> 01:05:16,340
<i>All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.</i>

641
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:18,633
<i>Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.</i>

642
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,732
Don! I will never marry you.

643
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:37,319
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

644
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:40,655
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

645
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:14,230
<i>As it turned out, Sandra was able to
k eep her same date at the chapel.</i>

646
01:06:14,397 --> 01:06:17,609
<i>Only the groom had changed.</i>

647
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:22,614
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

648
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,867
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

649
01:06:29,704 --> 01:06:33,458
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

650
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:37,587
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

651
01:06:38,713 --> 01:06:41,215
Never really known why.

652
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:44,677
There was a time when I was 11...

653
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:46,804
You were talking about your wedding.

654
01:06:46,971 --> 01:06:50,892
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

655
01:06:51,058 --> 01:06:54,729
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

656
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:58,649
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

657
01:06:59,233 --> 01:06:59,734
I like your stories.

658
01:06:59,734 --> 01:07:00,735
I like your stories.

659
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,737
And I like you.

660
01:07:02,737 --> 01:07:03,904
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

661
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:07,199
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

662
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:10,536
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

663
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:14,206
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...

664
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:17,042
...the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

665
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:20,713
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra...

666
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,552
...the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S. Government.

667
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:47,197
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point...

668
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:50,367
...and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra...

669
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:54,496
...I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

670
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:57,833
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find...

671
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,337
...with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

672
01:08:02,504 --> 01:08:05,048
Go! Go!

673
01:08:07,593 --> 01:08:09,678
<i>When I was offered
a secret mission...</i>

674
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:13,765
<i>... to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...</i>

675
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:17,102
<i>... I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.</i>

676
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:22,774
Go! Go!

677
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:20,558
Any of you got needs?

678
01:12:06,496 --> 01:12:08,540
How could you miss your cue?

679
01:12:08,707 --> 01:12:12,669
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

680
01:12:13,002 --> 01:12:14,546
You weren't alone!

681
01:12:16,714 --> 01:12:17,924
Who the hell are you?

682
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:19,926
I'm not going to hurt you.

683
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:21,094
Damn right you're not.

684
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:22,262
GU ARD!

685
01:12:24,097 --> 01:12:25,765
Tell your men not to bother us!

686
01:12:25,932 --> 01:12:27,225
And close that curtain!

687
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,105
Please, I need your help.

688
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:35,233
What makes you think we'll help you?

689
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:48,955
<i>Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...</i>

690
01:12:49,122 --> 01:12:52,041
<i>... and the ordeal that brought me
before them.</i>

691
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:55,545
<i>As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.</i>

692
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:57,880
<i>It was destined to be.</i>

693
01:12:58,089 --> 01:13:01,217
<i>We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...</i>

694
01:13:01,384 --> 01:13:03,636
<i>... inv olving a whaling ship
to Russia...</i>

695
01:13:03,803 --> 01:13:07,890
<i>...a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.</i>

696
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:10,559
<i>We all knew it would be dangerous.</i>

697
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:14,230
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

698
01:13:15,022 --> 01:13:16,273
I can get you bookings.

699
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:19,235
I know the biggest man
in show business.

700
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:21,362
Bob Hope?!

701
01:13:21,696 --> 01:13:22,738
Bigger.

702
01:13:26,492 --> 01:13:27,493
Ready?

703
01:13:30,913 --> 01:13:34,792
<i>And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...</i>

704
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:36,919
<i>... halfway around the world.</i>

705
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:41,423
<i>Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.</i>

706
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:45,594
<i>And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.</i>

707
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,405
No, God!

708
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:10,452
<i>After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.</i>

709
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:14,998
<i>When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.</i>

710
01:14:15,165 --> 01:14:20,003
<i>When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.</i>

711
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,208
I talked with your father last night.

712
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:04,673
You never told me
how your parents met.

713
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:06,675
They met at Auburn.

714
01:15:06,841 --> 01:15:10,679
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

715
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:12,806
The circus. The war.

716
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:14,849
You never told me any of that.

717
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:17,185
That's because most of it
never happened.

718
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,272
But it's romantic.

719
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:27,237
- What?
- What, I know better...

720
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:30,573
...than to argue romance
with a French woman.

721
01:15:32,325 --> 01:15:34,327
Do you love your father?

722
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:38,081
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

723
01:15:39,457 --> 01:15:41,042
Do you love him?

724
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:48,174
You have to understand.

725
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:52,095
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

726
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:56,182
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

727
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:59,894
Another family, another house.

728
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:03,356
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

729
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:05,149
Or, or...

730
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:11,656
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

731
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:17,286
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories...

732
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:19,956
...because he can't stand
this boring place.

733
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:23,250
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?

734
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:28,089
He's never told me
a single true thing.

735
01:16:30,049 --> 01:16:31,592
Look, hey...

736
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,763
I know why you like him.

737
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,724
I know why everyone likes him.

738
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,145
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

739
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:46,273
Oh, you're not.

740
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,945
And I think you should talk to him.

741
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:59,286
<i>Larry Puck ett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.</i>

742
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:03,123
<i>Larry Puck ett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.</i>

743
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:07,336
<i>And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.</i>

744
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:10,214
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.

745
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:14,885
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

746
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:20,849
I know someone who hasn't.

747
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:24,645
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

748
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:28,315
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it...

749
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:31,568
...and flew off with the whole car.

750
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:39,534
But the real story
is how I got the car.

751
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:41,411
- You see...
- Dad?

752
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,038
Son.

753
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:45,290
Can we talk?

754
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,128
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

755
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:52,506
I'll help you.

756
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,358
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?

757
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:13,985
I saw an iceberg once.

758
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:17,447
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

759
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:21,701
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

760
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,662
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!

761
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:26,790
What?

762
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,794
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

763
01:18:31,002 --> 01:18:33,671
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question...

764
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:36,174
...because people
want to answer questions.

765
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:39,886
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."

766
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:43,514
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 10 percent.

767
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:47,060
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

768
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:49,354
And that's...

769
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,231
...what it is with you, Dad.

770
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,151
I am only seeing this little bit...

771
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:57,153
...that sticks above the water.

772
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,531
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My...

773
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:03,618
Dad, I have no idea who you are...

774
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:06,996
...because you've never told me
a single fact.

775
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:11,417
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

776
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:14,879
You tell... lies, Dad.

777
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:16,339
You tell amusing lies.

778
01:19:16,505 --> 01:19:19,592
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

779
01:19:19,759 --> 01:19:22,637
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain...

780
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:25,264
...when your son is 10 and 15
and 20 and 30.

781
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:28,267
And I believed you.

782
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:33,481
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

783
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:36,776
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible...

784
01:19:36,942 --> 01:19:39,153
...I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

785
01:19:39,361 --> 01:19:41,614
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

786
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:43,616
Just as charming and just as fake.

787
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:45,993
You think I'm fake.

788
01:19:47,495 --> 01:19:51,624
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

789
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,044
Look.

790
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:59,048
I'm about to have...

791
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:00,799
...a kid of my own.

792
01:20:00,966 --> 01:20:03,677
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life...

793
01:20:03,844 --> 01:20:05,888
...never understanding me.

794
01:20:06,055 --> 01:20:08,474
It would kill you, huh?

795
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:14,021
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

796
01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:15,814
Just yourself.

797
01:20:16,023 --> 01:20:19,818
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

798
01:20:20,027 --> 01:20:23,113
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

799
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,784
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

800
01:20:59,107 --> 01:21:03,737
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office...

801
01:21:03,904 --> 01:21:06,990
...and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

802
01:21:07,115 --> 01:21:08,658
So...

803
01:21:10,285 --> 01:21:14,080
You'll know better than me
what's important.

804
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:27,469
What is it?

805
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:30,889
It was during the war.

806
01:21:31,055 --> 01:21:34,934
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

807
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:38,563
Oh, that really happened?

808
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:42,525
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

809
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:46,863
I think I'll go check on him.

810
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:51,743
I need to lie down for a bit.

811
01:21:51,868 --> 01:21:54,495
Okay, go.

812
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:14,098
<i>After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.</i>

813
01:22:14,265 --> 01:22:15,975
<i>Each had the advantage over me.</i>

814
01:22:16,184 --> 01:22:19,729
<i>They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.</i>

815
01:22:19,896 --> 01:22:21,647
<i>With my prospects few...</i>

816
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:25,401
<i>... I took a job as a travelling salesman.
It suited me.</i>

817
01:22:25,776 --> 01:22:28,946
<i>If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...</i>

818
01:22:29,113 --> 01:22:31,365
<i>... it's that I am a social person.</i>

819
01:22:32,033 --> 01:22:35,494
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

820
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,706
<i>I could be gone
for weeks at a time.</i>

821
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:41,792
<i>But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...</i>

822
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:45,671
<i>... into an account set aside
for a proper house...</i>

823
01:22:45,838 --> 01:22:47,965
<i>... with a white pick et fence.</i>

824
01:22:53,804 --> 01:22:57,308
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product...

825
01:22:57,474 --> 01:22:59,852
...the Handi-matic.

826
01:23:15,326 --> 01:23:18,579
<i>A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...</i>

827
01:23:18,746 --> 01:23:22,374
<i>... until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.</i>

828
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,734
Edward?

829
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,193
Edward Bloom!

830
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:52,279
It's me, Norther Winslow.

831
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:54,322
I don't believe it.

832
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:58,785
<i>I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...</i>

833
01:23:58,994 --> 01:24:00,871
<i>... all the way out in Texas.</i>

834
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,875
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

835
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,712
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

836
01:24:08,879 --> 01:24:10,380
So I travelled.

837
01:24:10,547 --> 01:24:13,508
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

838
01:24:13,884 --> 01:24:16,553
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

839
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,888
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

840
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,349
What are you doing now?

841
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,060
I'm robbing this place.

842
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,066
All right, everybody down!

843
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:34,779
Hey!
Just slide that over.

844
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:43,788
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?

845
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:45,748
The gun.

846
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,627
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers...

847
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:54,048
...and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

848
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:03,474
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

849
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:05,935
Let's go!

850
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:27,582
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

851
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,835
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

852
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:32,962
It's not that.

853
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,840
It's just...

854
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,972
There's no money.

855
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,601
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

856
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:51,772
<i>It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...</i>

857
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:56,444
<i>... not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.</i>

858
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,612
All right, let's go!

859
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,834
Norther!

860
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:34,189
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

861
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,859
And that's just from the drawers.

862
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:39,528
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

863
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:52,082
This is it? The whole vault?

864
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,543
I'm afraid so.

865
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,256
It's got your deposit slip on it.

866
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,300
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

867
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:06,263
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...

868
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,641
<i>I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...</i>

869
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,686
<i>... and its effect on real-estate prices...</i>

870
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:16,022
<i>... and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...</i>

871
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,985
<i>... had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.</i>

872
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:24,948
<i>Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:</i>

873
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:28,326
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

874
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:32,080
<i>I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...</i>

875
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,540
Thanks for the hand!

876
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,709
<i>... Norther's were just beginning.</i>

877
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,294
<i>When Norther made
his first million dollars...</i>

878
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:40,755
<i>... he sent me a check for 10, 000.</i>

879
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:45,051
<i>I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.</i>

880
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,346
<i>It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...</i>

881
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,598
<i>... with a white pick et fence.</i>

882
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:54,936
<i>And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.</i>

883
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,805
I was drying out.

884
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,433
I see.

885
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:40,815
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister...

886
01:28:41,023 --> 01:28:43,776
...so we can just spray you
like a fern.

887
01:29:09,718 --> 01:29:12,179
Come, now.

888
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,895
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

889
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:21,122
You carry on. I'll see...

890
01:30:25,794 --> 01:30:27,587
Hello.

891
01:30:28,213 --> 01:30:32,133
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.

892
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,427
And you're Will.

893
01:30:34,594 --> 01:30:37,597
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

894
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:42,936
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

895
01:30:43,144 --> 01:30:45,438
We can go again next week.

896
01:30:45,605 --> 01:30:47,607
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

897
01:30:47,774 --> 01:30:50,360
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

898
01:31:01,829 --> 01:31:03,289
How did you know my father?

899
01:31:03,706 --> 01:31:05,750
Well, this was on his sales route...

900
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:09,963
...so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

901
01:31:10,129 --> 01:31:12,215
Were you having an affair?

902
01:31:14,634 --> 01:31:17,053
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

903
01:31:17,887 --> 01:31:21,474
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

904
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:26,312
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

905
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,650
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...

906
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:34,362
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

907
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:38,908
Well, can I ask you a question?

908
01:31:39,075 --> 01:31:41,827
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

909
01:31:42,954 --> 01:31:45,331
Because he's dying.

910
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:58,677
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

911
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:00,971
You have one image of your father...

912
01:32:01,138 --> 01:32:03,390
...and it'd be wrong of me
to change it...

913
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:05,518
...especially this late in the game.

914
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:08,145
My father talked about things
he never did...

915
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:11,732
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

916
01:32:11,899 --> 01:32:13,901
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

917
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:20,407
The first thing
you have to understand...

918
01:32:20,574 --> 01:32:23,535
...is that your father
never meant to end up here.

919
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:25,496
Yet he did.

920
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:27,373
Twice.

921
01:32:27,915 --> 01:32:30,417
The first time, he was early.

922
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:32,836
The second time, he was late.

923
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:38,842
<i>Those days, your father was working
for himself.</i>

924
01:32:39,009 --> 01:32:41,929
<i>If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom...</i>

925
01:32:42,096 --> 01:32:47,100
<i>...it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.</i>

926
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:50,562
<i>One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...</i>

927
01:32:50,729 --> 01:32:54,399
<i>... when he hit a thunderstorm
unlik e any in his life.</i>

928
01:34:42,715 --> 01:34:45,218
<i>Fate has a way of circling back
on a man...</i>

929
01:34:45,384 --> 01:34:47,553
<i>...and taking him by surprise.</i>

930
01:34:52,224 --> 01:34:55,936
<i>A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.</i>

931
01:34:56,103 --> 01:35:00,024
<i>This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.</i>

932
01:35:01,192 --> 01:35:04,737
<i>A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...</i>

933
01:35:04,945 --> 01:35:08,074
<i>... and with it, banks, liens and debt.</i>

934
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:13,078
<i>Almost everywhere you look ed,
people were bankrupt.</i>

935
01:35:14,371 --> 01:35:17,708
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

936
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:20,586
<i>- The opening bid will be $10,000.
- So Edward Bloom...</i>

937
01:35:20,753 --> 01:35:23,422
<i>...decided to buy the town.
- 50,000.</i>

938
01:35:27,593 --> 01:35:30,763
<i>- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...</i>

939
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:36,101
<i>... but he had made other men rich,
and now he ask ed for their fav ours.</i>

940
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:41,065
<i>- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.</i>

941
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:44,443
<i>They only had Edward's words
to describe it.</i>

942
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:47,905
<i>That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.</i>

943
01:35:48,322 --> 01:35:50,824
<i>So first he bought the farms.</i>

944
01:35:51,033 --> 01:35:54,953
<i>Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.</i>

945
01:35:55,496 --> 01:36:00,584
<i>Whatever he bought, the people were
not ask ed to leave or pay rent.</i>

946
01:36:00,751 --> 01:36:03,670
<i>They were just ask ed to k eep
doing as they were doing.</i>

947
01:36:04,087 --> 01:36:08,133
<i>In that way, he could mak e sure
the town would never die.</i>

948
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:15,766
<i>Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.</i>

949
01:36:15,932 --> 01:36:18,602
<i>With one exception.</i>

950
01:36:42,876 --> 01:36:45,962
You must be Edward Bloom.

951
01:36:46,087 --> 01:36:47,380
How do you know?

952
01:36:48,006 --> 01:36:50,675
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

953
01:36:50,925 --> 01:36:53,928
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

954
01:36:54,095 --> 01:36:56,431
You're buying the town.

955
01:36:56,973 --> 01:37:01,019
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

956
01:37:01,561 --> 01:37:06,483
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

957
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:07,984
And so I've heard.

958
01:37:08,193 --> 01:37:11,654
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

959
01:37:11,821 --> 01:37:15,283
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

960
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:18,077
Now, let me get this straight.

961
01:37:18,286 --> 01:37:20,914
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

962
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,791
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

963
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:27,920
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

964
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:30,048
Do I have that right?

965
01:37:30,214 --> 01:37:32,842
In so many words, yes.

966
01:37:33,718 --> 01:37:35,720
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

967
01:37:36,345 --> 01:37:39,348
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...

968
01:37:39,515 --> 01:37:42,518
...in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

969
01:37:43,769 --> 01:37:48,524
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

970
01:37:49,942 --> 01:37:52,403
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

971
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:54,155
Some sort of midlife crisis?

972
01:37:54,947 --> 01:37:57,700
Instead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

973
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,328
Helping people makes me happy.

974
01:38:01,078 --> 01:38:04,248
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

975
01:38:04,415 --> 01:38:08,335
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.

976
01:38:08,544 --> 01:38:10,421
You did exactly what you promised.

977
01:38:11,047 --> 01:38:15,676
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

978
01:38:23,225 --> 01:38:24,810
You're Beamen's daughter.

979
01:38:26,645 --> 01:38:29,356
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

980
01:38:30,065 --> 01:38:35,154
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

981
01:38:44,788 --> 01:38:48,083
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

982
01:38:48,959 --> 01:38:50,669
I see.

983
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:54,131
Well, thank you for your time.

984
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:08,478
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

985
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,783
- Oh, I'm so sorry! L...
- It's okay. Just leave it.

986
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:24,494
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.

987
01:39:25,996 --> 01:39:28,623
- But...
- Go.

988
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:35,630
<i>Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.</i>

989
01:39:35,839 --> 01:39:37,674
<i>But Edward was not lik e most men.</i>

990
01:39:37,674 --> 01:39:38,925
<i>But Edward was not lik e most men.</i>

991
01:39:48,268 --> 01:39:49,644
Hold!

992
01:39:53,148 --> 01:39:55,942
They both had completely
different characters but...

993
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,820
...well, just one pair of legs.

994
01:40:09,164 --> 01:40:12,709
<i>As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...</i>

995
01:40:12,876 --> 01:40:16,796
<i>... until the shack no longer
resembled itself.</i>

996
01:40:33,062 --> 01:40:37,066
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

997
01:40:37,859 --> 01:40:40,278
By the time the twins and I
had got to Havana...

998
01:40:40,445 --> 01:40:46,075
...we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

999
01:41:05,386 --> 01:41:08,889
- Well...
- You could leave it there.

1000
01:41:26,407 --> 01:41:28,075
No.

1001
01:41:38,127 --> 01:41:40,087
Now, don't.

1002
01:41:40,254 --> 01:41:45,384
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that...

1003
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,013
I'm in love with my wife.

1004
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:52,016
Yeah, I know.

1005
01:41:52,224 --> 01:41:55,352
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die...

1006
01:41:55,519 --> 01:41:57,563
...she's the only one.

1007
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:00,232
Lucky girl.

1008
01:42:01,316 --> 01:42:04,194
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

1009
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,413
Wait! Edward.

1010
01:42:55,996 --> 01:42:58,873
<i>One day, Edward Bloom left...</i>

1011
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,877
<i>... and never returned
to the town he'd saved.</i>

1012
01:43:15,432 --> 01:43:17,267
<i>As for the girl...</i>

1013
01:43:17,433 --> 01:43:20,145
<i>... the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...</i>

1014
01:43:20,311 --> 01:43:22,689
<i>... and crazy at that.</i>

1015
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:27,610
<i>She became something
of a legend herself.</i>

1016
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:33,283
<i>And the story ended where it began.</i>

1017
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:37,370
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was...

1018
01:43:37,537 --> 01:43:38,788
...old when he was young.

1019
01:43:39,122 --> 01:43:42,250
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1020
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:47,046
See, to him there's only
two women:

1021
01:43:47,255 --> 01:43:48,840
Your mother...

1022
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:50,425
...and everyone else.

1023
01:43:50,675 --> 01:43:52,593
And one day...

1024
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,181
...I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1025
01:43:58,224 --> 01:44:00,434
I was living in a fairy tale.

1026
01:44:01,561 --> 01:44:03,688
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1027
01:44:04,063 --> 01:44:06,607
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...

1028
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:08,192
I'm glad I know.

1029
01:44:08,943 --> 01:44:12,238
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1030
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,532
And I'm...

1031
01:44:15,032 --> 01:44:16,409
I was never gonna be.

1032
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:21,539
I was make-believe.

1033
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:27,420
And his other life, you...

1034
01:44:28,254 --> 01:44:29,755
You were real.

1035
01:44:54,071 --> 01:44:55,698
Mom?

1036
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:58,575
Josephine?

1037
01:45:00,369 --> 01:45:02,246
Josephine?

1038
01:45:15,926 --> 01:45:18,011
Will!

1039
01:45:19,137 --> 01:45:20,305
What happened?

1040
01:45:20,472 --> 01:45:22,307
Your father had a stroke.

1041
01:45:22,474 --> 01:45:25,560
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1042
01:45:25,727 --> 01:45:27,104
Is he gonna be okay?

1043
01:45:35,195 --> 01:45:37,114
I don't suppose that I could...

1044
01:45:37,322 --> 01:45:39,783
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case...

1045
01:45:40,659 --> 01:45:43,578
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1046
01:45:43,745 --> 01:45:44,996
I'll stay.

1047
01:45:45,997 --> 01:45:49,042
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1048
01:45:50,919 --> 01:45:53,880
- Is that okay?
- Fine.

1049
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,719
Will, you'll call if there's any?

1050
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:03,014
I will. I will. I'll call.

1051
01:46:04,516 --> 01:46:08,520
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.

1052
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:16,212
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1053
01:47:19,382 --> 01:47:21,926
One of my greatest
annoyances is when...

1054
01:47:22,134 --> 01:47:25,054
...people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1055
01:47:25,262 --> 01:47:27,390
Well, we have an advantage.

1056
01:47:27,556 --> 01:47:29,934
My father and I never talk.

1057
01:47:36,524 --> 01:47:39,610
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1058
01:47:39,777 --> 01:47:43,155
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1059
01:47:43,322 --> 01:47:47,284
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1060
01:47:47,451 --> 01:47:49,286
No.

1061
01:47:49,453 --> 01:47:52,998
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1062
01:47:53,165 --> 01:47:57,586
Her neighbour drove her, on account of
your father was away on business...

1063
01:47:57,795 --> 01:47:59,421
...in Wichita.

1064
01:47:59,588 --> 01:48:03,967
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1065
01:48:04,134 --> 01:48:09,765
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1066
01:48:10,349 --> 01:48:15,062
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries...

1067
01:48:15,229 --> 01:48:19,525
...so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1068
01:48:19,691 --> 01:48:22,444
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1069
01:48:23,028 --> 01:48:25,530
Not very exciting, is it?

1070
01:48:25,697 --> 01:48:29,534
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version...

1071
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:34,206
...and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring...

1072
01:48:34,414 --> 01:48:36,375
...I might choose the fancy version.

1073
01:48:37,042 --> 01:48:39,002
But, then that's just me.

1074
01:48:40,087 --> 01:48:41,671
I kind of liked your version.

1075
01:49:04,236 --> 01:49:05,779
Dad?

1076
01:49:07,906 --> 01:49:11,534
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1077
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:16,456
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1078
01:49:16,623 --> 01:49:18,666
You want some water?

1079
01:49:19,751 --> 01:49:21,252
You want a bit of water?

1080
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:26,841
The river.

1081
01:49:28,426 --> 01:49:30,220
The river?

1082
01:49:30,762 --> 01:49:34,891
Tell me how it happens.

1083
01:49:36,809 --> 01:49:38,770
How what happens?

1084
01:49:39,771 --> 01:49:42,190
How I go.

1085
01:49:46,569 --> 01:49:49,072
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1086
01:50:03,085 --> 01:50:06,422
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1087
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,345
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1088
01:50:12,512 --> 01:50:15,097
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1089
01:50:17,391 --> 01:50:21,020
Like this.

1090
01:50:21,187 --> 01:50:23,230
Okay. Okay.

1091
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:29,320
Okay, so it's in the morning...

1092
01:50:29,528 --> 01:50:33,657
...and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1093
01:50:34,116 --> 01:50:37,453
<i>... and I see you,
and somehow you're better.</i>

1094
01:50:37,661 --> 01:50:38,788
Dad?

1095
01:50:38,954 --> 01:50:40,998
<i>You're different.</i>

1096
01:50:41,874 --> 01:50:44,877
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.

1097
01:50:45,044 --> 01:50:46,295
<i>Then I say:</i>

1098
01:50:46,462 --> 01:50:47,922
Dad, you're in no condition...

1099
01:50:48,088 --> 01:50:50,466
Get that wheelchair.

1100
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:54,803
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1101
01:50:55,012 --> 01:50:57,431
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1102
01:50:57,598 --> 01:50:59,350
And we get in the wheelchair...

1103
01:50:59,516 --> 01:51:02,811
<i>- Faster!
- ... lik e we're escaping the hospital.</i>

1104
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:04,813
What are you doing?

1105
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:07,358
<i>We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.</i>

1106
01:51:07,524 --> 01:51:10,527
<i>- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.</i>

1107
01:51:10,694 --> 01:51:12,613
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1108
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:14,823
<i>Mom and Josephine
are at the end.</i>

1109
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:17,785
No time to explain! Stall them!

1110
01:51:23,457 --> 01:51:25,501
We come flying out
over the curb...

1111
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:30,047
<i>... and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.</i>

1112
01:51:30,172 --> 01:51:32,549
And I pick you up...

1113
01:51:32,716 --> 01:51:36,303
...and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1114
01:51:40,557 --> 01:51:43,352
Leave it! We don't need it!

1115
01:51:45,395 --> 01:51:47,689
Water. I need water.

1116
01:51:51,068 --> 01:51:53,069
- Where are we going?
- The river.

1117
01:52:00,076 --> 01:52:02,537
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic...

1118
01:52:02,746 --> 01:52:05,498
...because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1119
01:52:46,289 --> 01:52:51,502
And as we get close to the river...

1120
01:53:00,178 --> 01:53:02,388
He's here!

1121
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,558
<i>... we see that everybody
is already there.</i>

1122
01:53:21,991 --> 01:53:23,576
And I mean...

1123
01:53:24,827 --> 01:53:26,078
...everyone.

1124
01:53:38,591 --> 01:53:41,343
It's unbelievable.

1125
01:53:41,802 --> 01:53:46,015
The story of my life.

1126
01:53:54,565 --> 01:53:57,526
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1127
01:53:57,693 --> 01:54:00,237
Everyone is just so glad
to see you...

1128
01:54:01,363 --> 01:54:03,657
...and send you off right.

1129
01:54:03,824 --> 01:54:09,455
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1130
01:54:20,799 --> 01:54:23,343
My girl in the river.

1131
01:55:34,956 --> 01:55:37,750
You become what you always were.

1132
01:55:39,419 --> 01:55:41,754
A very big fish.

1133
01:55:46,843 --> 01:55:49,220
And that's how it happens.

1134
01:55:50,805 --> 01:55:52,599
Yeah.

1135
01:55:55,018 --> 01:55:57,645
Exactly.

1136
01:56:39,687 --> 01:56:41,105
Mom?

1137
01:58:08,316 --> 01:58:11,528
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1138
01:58:11,736 --> 01:58:15,240
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1139
01:58:15,448 --> 01:58:18,368
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1140
01:58:18,535 --> 01:58:20,495
He restores my soul.

1141
01:58:20,662 --> 01:58:24,666
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1142
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:28,586
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1143
01:58:28,753 --> 01:58:31,381
...I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1144
01:58:31,548 --> 01:58:35,844
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1145
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:27,311
<i>Have you ever heard a jok e so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?</i>

1146
01:59:27,478 --> 01:59:31,566
<i>And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.</i>

1147
01:59:31,732 --> 01:59:34,860
<i>You remember why you loved it
in the first place.</i>

1148
01:59:36,737 --> 01:59:39,907
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 15 feet tall!

1149
01:59:40,074 --> 01:59:43,536
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1150
01:59:43,703 --> 01:59:44,996
Pretty much.

1151
01:59:45,162 --> 01:59:47,456
See? So he was a giant.

1152
01:59:47,623 --> 01:59:50,084
<i>That was my father's final joke,
I guess.</i>

1153
01:59:50,209 --> 01:59:56,173
<i>A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.</i>

1154
01:59:57,633 --> 01:59:59,969
<i>They live on after him.</i>

1155
02:00:02,221 --> 02:00:05,558
<i>And in that way,
he becomes immortal.</i>
