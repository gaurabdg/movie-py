Richard, he has
nowhere else to go.

I'm not!

29
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,794
Look, I'm at the hospital.
Yeah, okay. Bye.

30

Your brother's fine.

- I know. The insurance.</i>

34
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:37,762
You want to see him?

35
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,692
Hey, Frank.

Sheryl.

37

I'm so glad you're still here.

38
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:08,231
Well, that makes one of us.

39
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:11,431
<i>A strong low pressure

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,570
Anyone?

47
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,030
Down here.
We have you with Dwayne.

48
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,690
<i>Dwayne, hi.
Uncle Frank's here.</i>

49
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,459
He doesn't mind, Frank.
We talked.

50
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,469
<i>Wha- I know. I know. But we can't have you
sleeping alone. The doctor said.</i>

00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,669
I'm sorry.
I have to insist.

52
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,749
You'll get along fine.
He's really quiet.

53
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,439
<i>And here's your cot.</i>

54
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,619
Please, Frank.

55
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,989
Please.

56
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,088
Thank you.

57
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,098
I'm gonna start dinner.

58
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,388
You can come out
when you're settled.

59
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:43,698
And, uh, just leave the door open.
That's important.

60
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,648
Dwayne, honey, there's
a bucket of chicken in the car.

61
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,847
Can you get it?
And, uh, I'll make a salad.

62
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:02,187
<i>- Olive?
- Yeah?</i>

63
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,187
<i>- Is Grandpa with you?
- Yeah.</i>

64
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,587
<i>- What are you guys doing?
- Rehearsing.</i>

65
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:09,317
<i>- Okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes.
- Okay.</i>

66
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:13,687
- Hi.
- Hi. Frank's here.

67
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:16,927
Oh, God.
Did, uh, Stan Grossman call?

68
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,507
<i>Well, check the machine.</i>

69
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,937
- Dwayne, please, come on.
The chicken. It's in the car.

70
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,567
Will you set the table?
We'll do paper plates tonight.

71
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:28,646
<i>Remember Olive
was runner-up in the Little Miss Sunshine?</i>

72
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:33,016
<i>- Theyjust called right now-
- Hey, it's your sister!</i>

73
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,556
Fuck.

74
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,626
Hi. Richard Hoover
for Stan Grossman, please.

75
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:49,226
Any way to reach him or-

76
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,566
<i>Well, I'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.</i>

77
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,666
<i>If-</i>

78
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,175
<i>Yes.</i>

79
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:01,405
Okay, could you please just have him
call me anytime over the weekend?

80
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,605
He has my cell number.
Just to let me know we're on.

81
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:08,845
Okay? Thank you. Bye.

82
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,475
- So what happened with Stan Grossman?
- He's in Scottsdale.

83
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,815
<i>Why didn't he call?</i>

84
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,685
Will you let me
worry about this, please?

85
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,025
Dwayne, can you check on Frank?
Tell him it's dinnertime.

86
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,625
<i>Olive! Dinnertime!</i>

87
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,634
<i>Coming!</i>

88
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:33,044
What? Dinner?

89
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,094
What, you don't talk anymore?

90
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,394
<i>Why not?</i>

91
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:46,594
<i>You can talk.
You just choose not to?</i>

92
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,434
<i>Is that Nietzsche?</i>

93
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:58,743
You don't speak
because of Friedrich Nietzsche.

94
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:06,153
Far out.

95
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:16,053
<i>Frank, you can sit here next to Dwayne.</i>

96
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:20,363
Here's the salad, and I'm gonna run
and get Sprite for everyone.

97
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,362
<i>Olive, come on!
Dinnertime!</i>

98
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:27,372
<i>Okay.</i>

99
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,872
So who do you hang out with?

100
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:43,912
No one?

101
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,231
<i>What about your family?</i>

102
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,531
<i>Frank! Hey!</i>

103
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,701
- Richard.
- Good to... see you.

104
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:21,680
Let me get Olive.

105
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,160
<i>- Olive? Dad?
- You guys, go on and start.</i>

106
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,350
<i>- Let's go!
- We're coming.</i>

107
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,360
<i>- Frank, some Sprite?
- Yes.</i>

108
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,400
<i>And I want everyone to have
at least a little salad.</i>

109
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,730
Thanks, Sheryl.

110
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,740
Honey.

111
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,010
So, Sheryl, I couldn't help noticing
Dwayne has stopped speaking.

112
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,239
Oh, yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.

113
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,439
You've taken a vow of silence?

114
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,389
<i>Yeah. He's gonna join the Air Force Academy,
become a test pilot...</i>

115
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:57,479
and he's taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal.

116
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,579
<i>- You're kidding?
- Hi, Uncle Frank.</i>

117
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,889
Oh, hey, Olive.
Wow, you're gettin' big.

118
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,689
<i>Almost like a real person.</i>

119
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,579
- What happened to your arms?
- Olive.

120
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,849
<i>That's all right.
I had a little accident. I'm okay.</i>

121
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,249
- How's the, uh, routine coming, honey?
- It's good.

122
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,258
Yeah? When are you
gonna show it to us?

123
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:20,588
I don't know.
It's up to Grandpa.

124
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,218
A couple of days.
It still needs work.

125
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:27,028
What's that? Chicken?
Every night it's the fuckin' chicken!

126
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:31,068
- Holy God Almighty! It is possible just once-
- Dad!

127
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:34,228
We could get something to eat around here
that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?

128
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,968
<i>- Hey, Dad! Dad!
- I'm just sayin'-</i>

129
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,568
<i>- Christ.
- When you want to start cooking your own food, you're welcome.</i>

130
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:44,808
- At Sunset Manor, you know- - If you like
Sunset Manor, you shouldn't have got kicked out.

131
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,277
<i>For God's sakes.</i>

132
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,347
So when did you start
with the vow?

133
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>Been nine months, Frank.
He hasn't said a word.</i>

134
00:11:57,827 --> 00:12:02,627
Not one. I think it shows
tremendous discipline.

135
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:03,927
- Richard.
- I really do.

136
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,867
Really. I think we could
learn something from Dwayne.

137
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:10,307
Dwayne has a goal.
He has a dream.

138
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,967
It may not be my dream,
may not be yours...

139
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:16,406
but he's pursuing it with
great conviction and focus.

140
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,416
In fact, I was thinking
about the nine steps-

141
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,416
Oh, for crying out loud!

142
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:24,476
And how Dwayne's utilizing seven of them
in his personal quest to self-fulfillment.

143
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:25,986
Richard, please.

144
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:28,076
Well, I'm just saying
I've come around.

145
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,216
I think he could use our support.

146
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,596
How did it happen?

147
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:37,426
- How did what happen?
- Your accident.

148
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,436
Honey, here.

149
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:42,626
<i>Oh, no, it's okay.
Unless you object.</i>

150
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:46,965
No, I'm pro-honesty here.
I just think, you know, it's up to you.

151
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:49,705
Be my guest.

152
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,875
Olive, um, Uncle Frank
didn't really have an accident.

153
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:59,645
<i>What happened was he...
tried to kill himself.</i>

154
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:03,155
<i>You did? Why?</i>

155
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:06,195
I'm sorry. I don't think
this is an appropriate conversation.

156
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:09,385
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, okay? Shh.

157
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,395
Why did you want to kill yourself?

158
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,994
<i>No, don't answer the question, Frank.</i>

159
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,534
<i>- Richard! Richard!
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.</i>

160
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:20,074
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

161
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,304
<i>- I was very unhappy.
- He's sick in his head.</i>

162
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:24,804
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation...

163
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:27,074
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

164
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:31,084
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

165
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,514
Why were you unhappy?

166
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:40,084
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

167
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,103
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

168
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,763
Who?

169
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,103
<i>One of my grad students.
I was very much in love with him.</i>

170
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,583
Him?

171
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:57,013
<i>It was a boy?
You fell in love with a boy?</i>

172
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,243
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

173
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,053
<i>You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.</i>

174
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:06,223
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

175
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,233
<i>- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- Well, no.</i>

176
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,892
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

177
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,262
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

178
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,532
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

179
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,202
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

180
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,712
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,942
So that's when.

182
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,412
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

183
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,812
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

184
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,052
<i>and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done...</i>

185
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,212
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

186
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,491
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.</i>

187
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,751
<i>- And that's when you tried to-
- Well, no.</i>

188
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,061
Actually, all of that was okay.

189
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,761
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

190
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:58,071
<i>awarded a genius grant
to Larry Sugarman.</i>

191
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,441
And that's when I-

192
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,141
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

193
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:06,811
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

194
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>Olive, the important thing
to understand here...</i>

195
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>is that Uncle Frank
gave up on himself.</i>

196
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,290
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

197
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,960
which is something winners never do.

198
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,830
So that's the story, okay?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh-

199
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,100
<i>Is he always like this? How can you stand it?</i>

200
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,110
Olive, tell him about your
routine while you're doing this.

201
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,110
Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is
a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque...

202
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,339
but you have to be six or seven
and you have to be a girl.

203
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,609
This is our sister.

204
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,279
- Cindy.
- Spring break.

205
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,749
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks...

206
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,219
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

207
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,729
- She made it to the top of the regionals out there.
- I was in second place.

208
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,819
Well, what do you think
your chances are?

209
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,899
I think I can win,
because some of the other girls...

210
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,399
<i>they've been doing it longer,
but I practice every day.</i>

211
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,369
- Yeah. Good luck.
- Not about luck, Frank.

212
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,968
<i>Luck is the name losers give
to their own failings.</i>

213
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,908
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

214
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,708
- You've got to want it badder than anybody else.
- I do.

215
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,148
<i>- Then you're gonna be a winner.
- Richard.</i>

216
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,218
It's the truth.

217
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,428
<i>You know, actually, there is a message
from Cindy on the machine.</i>

218
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,598
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

219
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:26,068
<i>- What? Little Miss Sunshine?
- Yeah.</i>

220
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,898
What?

221
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:35,247
<i>Sheryl, it's Cindy.</i>

222
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,247
Remember when Olive
was here last month?

223
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,787
She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?

224
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:43,377
<i>Theyjust called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>

225
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,387
I don't know why.
Something about diet pills.

226
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:49,947
- Now she has a place in the state
contest in Redondo Beach!

227
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,357
Oh, my gosh! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

228
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,367
<i>- Finish your dinner!
- I'm finished!</i>

229
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,097
- What happened?
- I'm just calling to- Cindy!

230
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:04,436
Yeah, we just got it.
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

231
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:07,206
<i>- I won! I won! I won!
- No, I didn't get that.</i>

232
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:11,476
<i>The machine cut you off. Okay.</i>

233
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,986
<i>Redondo Beach. This Sunday?</i>

234
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:19,146
<i>- Wh-Are you guys going?
- Yes.</i>

235
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,386
- Can you put it off?
- They have to. They have to.

236
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:25,126
- Where does that leave us?
- We can't do it. We can't.

237
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,956
No, no- No, I understand
that, Cindy. Yeah.

238
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:31,556
- They- - I just- No, I'll just
figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

239
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,605
It's this Sunday?
Why can'tJeff and Cindy take her?

240
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,735
They have some equestrian
thing in Santa Barbara.

241
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,575
You know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.

242
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:43,335
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

243
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,935
What about Olive?

244
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:51,185
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

245
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,485
I won!

246
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,685
I'm going! We're going!

247
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:58,195
- You promised?
- We'll fly out and come back Monday.

248
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,765
- How are you gonna get around out there?
- We'll rent a car.

249
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,354
- And stay at a hotel?
- We can afford it.

250
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:06,694
- This is our seed money.
- Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

251
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,104
- Don't start that.
- It all goes to your nine steps!

252
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,534
I told you I'm gonna talk
to Stan Grossman!

253
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:15,204
We're gonna get locked and loaded on this
deal and start generating some income!

254
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:18,214
<i>- But in the meantime we've gotta be-
- Okay, okay! We'll drive!</i>

255
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,404
- I'm not drivin'.
- How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

256
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,314
<i>- Well, Grandpa does not have to come.
- What? I coached her!</i>

257
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,684
I gave her the moves.
I gotta go.

258
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,983
- Why don't you take the V. W?
- I cannot drive a shift. I tried.

259
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,493
<i>- We'll fly there.
- We can't afford it.</i>

260
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:37,223
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

261
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,633
Here. This is dessert.

262
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:45,663
<i>I won! I won!
I won! I won! I won!</i>

263
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,243
I won! I won! I won!

264
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:56,553
<i>Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine!</i>

265
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,682
All right.
I'll drive the bus.

266
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:02,562
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

267
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,562
- No offense, Frank.
- None taken.

268
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:07,162
You got Dwayne here.
They can look after each other.

269
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:10,242
No, Richard! That's asking too much.
If something happened-

270
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:13,872
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

271
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:17,932
<i>- Mom, where's my bathing suit?
- Right.</i>

272
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:21,212
Frank?

273
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,652
<i>I found it!</i>

274
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:25,652
Okay.

275
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:29,221
<i>I'm going! I'm going!
I'm going!</i>

276
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:33,091
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

277
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:37,061
<i>Come on, Dwayne.
It'll be a lot of fun.</i>

278
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,631
<i>You can go to the beach and-</i>

279
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,271
<i>"This is unfair.</i>

280
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:50,671
"All I ask is...

281
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:54,151
<i>that you leave me alone. "</i>

282
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,150
Dwayne, flight school.

283
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,660
I will give you permission
for flight school.

284
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,920
<i>I won! I won! I won! I won!
I'm gonna win this one too!</i>

285
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,500
"But I'm not going...

286
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,770
to have any fun. "

287
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,579
<i>Yeah, we're all with you
on that one, Dwayne.</i>

288
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,239
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

289
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:33,009
<i>- We're all coming, honey.
- Hey, uh, hold on.</i>

290
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,109
Olive, come over here
for a second.

291
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,689
<i>Come here.
Sit down for a second.</i>

292
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:42,249
Look, there's no sense
in entering a contest...

293
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,629
if you don't think
you're gonna win.

294
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:49,299
So do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

295
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,169
<i>Richard-</i>

296
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,998
Are you gonna win?

297
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,208
Yes!

298
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:04,878
We're going to California.

299
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,748
Good night, Dwayne.

300
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:33,977
<i>Not on your watch.
I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

301
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:45,327
<i>Thank you, Dwayne.</i>

302
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:50,007
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

303
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,006
Good night.

304
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:47,125
Jesus, I'm tired.
I'm so fucking tired.

305
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:49,125
Do you know how tired I am?

306
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:52,664
If some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it.

307
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:56,094
<i>- Dad? Watch the language, huh?
- That's how tired I am.</i>

308
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:58,174
She's listening to music.

309
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,964
Olive, I'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.

310
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:03,064
<i>- See?
- All right.</i>

311
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,264
<i>- But the rest of us.
- Oh, the rest of you.</i>

312
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,074
Can I give you some advice?

313
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:11,174
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

314
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:15,484
- I don't want you making the same mistakes I made.
- Can't wait to hear this.

315
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:18,523
Dwayne-That's your name,
right? Dwayne?

316
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:21,523
<i>This is the voice
of experience talking.</i>

317
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:24,683
<i>Are you listening?
Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.</i>

318
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:28,023
<i>- Hey! Dad!
- Not just one woman. A lot of women.</i>

319
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,293
<i>- That's enough, all right?
- Are you gettin' any?</i>

320
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:33,203
<i>- Dad!
- You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?</i>

321
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:36,333
<i>- Come on, please.
- No? Jesus. You're what, 15?</i>

322
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,773
<i>- My God, man!
- Dad!</i>

323
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:42,273
<i>You should be gettin'that young stuff.
That young stuff is the best in the world.</i>

324
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:45,113
- Dad, that's enough! Stop it!
- Will you kindly not interrupt!

325
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,512
See, right now you're jailbait.
They're jailbait. It's perfect.

326
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:52,382
I mean, you hit 18- Man, you're
talking about three to five.

327
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,462
Hey, I will pull
this truck over right now!

328
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,892
So pull the truck over!
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

329
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,892
- I still got Nazi bullets in my ass!
- Ah, the Nazi bullets!

330
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:04,992
You're as bad as those fuckers at Sunset Manor.

331
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:08,172
- What happened at Sunset Manor?
- Frank, don't encourage him.

332
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,412
<i>I'll tell you what happened.
I paid my money. They took my money.</i>

333
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:14,212
I should be able to do
what the fuck I want!

334
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:17,221
- He started snorting heroin.
- You started snorting heroin?

335
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,311
- I'm old!
- Well, that stuff'll kill you.

336
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:22,521
What am I, an idiot?
And don't you start taking that shit.

337
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:24,821
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

338
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:28,021
- What about you?
- I'm old. When you're old, you're crazy not to do it.

339
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,091
<i>We've tried. Believe me. The intervention
was a fiasco. He's worse than a two-year-old.</i>

340
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:35,101
Can we please talk
about something else?

341
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,401
<i>- I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor.
- Frank.</i>

342
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,771
Are you kidding me?
It was a fuckin' paradise.

343
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,941
They got a pool.
They got golf.

344
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:46,180
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.

345
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,280
<i>Look, I know you're a homo and all,
but maybe you can appreciate this.</i>

346
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,950
You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

347
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,430
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must've been very busy.

348
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,860
Whoa! I had second-degree burns
on my johnson. I kid you not.

349
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
<i>- Really?
- Forget about it.</i>

350
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,040
What are you guys
talking about?

351
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,070
Politics.

352
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,700
Oh.

353
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,869
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

354
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,139
Not one woman.
A lot of women.

355
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:22,049
<i>You heard what I said?
Did it go in anywhere?</i>

356
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:24,049
Yeah, I think
we get the point, Dad.

357
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,949
Don't show me the pad.
I don't want to see the fuckin' pad.

358
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,759
Mom, how much can we spend?

359
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,629
<i>I would say four dollars.
Anything under four dollars.</i>

360
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:38,929
Hi. You ready?

361
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,268
Yeah, I'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.

362
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:44,268
<i>All right.</i>

363
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,108
A number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

364
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:50,978
- Grapefruit. Okay.
- I would like a fruit plate.

365
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,018
<i>- And do you have chamomile?
- Yes.</i>

366
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,778
<i>- With honey, please.
- I would like the lumberjack and coffee.</i>

367
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,188
<i>- And extra bacon.
- Extra.</i>

368
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,518
- Now, Dad, you should probably-
- Richard, don't start.

369
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,528
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Well, it's his life.

370
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,618
<i>- Thank you, Sheryl.
- Garden salad?</i>

371
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:08,598
And you.

372
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:12,097
<i>- L- I'm sorry. I, um- Sorry.
- Take your time.</i>

373
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,827
<i>Don't apologize, Olive.
It's a sign of weakness.</i>

374
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:18,597
<i>Um, well, I want- Okay, okay.
I know what I want. I know.</i>

375
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:22,937
Okay, can I get
the waffles and, uh-

376
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:25,877
I don't-
What does "alamodey" mean?

377
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:29,077
- Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- Okay, "alamodey" then.

378
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,677
<i>- Olive, for breakfast?
- You said four dollars.</i>

379
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:35,657
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

380
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:37,387
Okay. Be right back.

381
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,586
<i>Actually, Olive,
"à la mode"in French...</i>

382
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:44,296
translates literally
as "in the fashion. "

383
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:46,536
À la mode.

384
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,576
<i>"Mode"is derived from Latin modus,
meaning "due or proper measure. "</i>

385
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:52,946
<i>- Frank, shut up.
- Richard!</i>

386
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,776
<i>Olive, can I tell you a little
something about ice cream?</i>

387
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:58,616
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, ice cream is made from cream...</i>

388
00:26:58,726 --> 00:27:00,586
which comes from cow's milk...

389
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:03,386
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

390
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,396
- Richard.
- What?

391
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:09,225
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- What? Find out what?

392
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:14,265
Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.

393
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,565
<i>- Richard, I swear to God-
- It's true.</i>

394
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:19,075
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

395
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:23,135
So if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

396
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:27,085
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

397
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:30,175
- Mom-
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

398
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:32,555
I like a woman
with meat on her bones.

399
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:34,625
<i>I don't- Why's everyone so upset?</i>

400
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:37,125
<i>No, no one's upset, honey. L-</i>

401
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:39,284
I just want you to understand...

402
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:43,524
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you want to be.

403
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,894
Whatever you want, it's okay.

404
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,904
<i>Okay, but, Olive,
let me ask you this.</i>

405
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,804
Those women in Miss America-

406
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:56,204
Are they skinny,
or are they fat?

407
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,104
<i>Honey?</i>

408
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:03,944
<i>Well, they're skinny, I guess.</i>

409
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:06,813
<i>Yeah. I guess they don't
eat a lot of ice cream.</i>

410
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:11,293
<i>Okay. Coffee. Coffee.</i>

411
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,753
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

412
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:18,923
Chamomile.
And here's your ice cream.

413
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,593
"Alamodey," right? I'll be back
with your waffles in a second.

414
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:28,103
Does anyone want my ice cream?

415
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:31,573
<i>Yeah, I'd like a little.
Dwayne? Frank?</i>

416
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:34,912
- Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- Do you mind if I have a little?

417
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:37,282
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- That looks really good.

418
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,852
<i>Boy, I feel sorry for anybody...</i>

419
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,612
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

420
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,422
<i>- Boy, that looks good.
- You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive?</i>

421
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:47,652
<i>Those waffles are gonna be
awful lonely in there.</i>

422
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:50,322
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Watch this.

423
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:53,662
Wait! Stop!
Don't eat it all.

424
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,972
- All right, Olive-
- Richard!

425
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,541
Hey, Stan!

426
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:11,101
Stan, it's Richard. Again.
Listen, I know you're busy...

427
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:15,121
but we're just dying to hear what sort
of numbers you came up with in Scottsdale.

428
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,691
- So, uh, give me a call, please.
- Hey, did you get him?

429
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:22,001
No, I can't get a signal out of this thing.

430
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:25,901
<i>How long till we get there?</i>

431
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,601
- A long time, honey.
- I know. But how long?

432
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:32,740
Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving
today and 200 tomorrow.

433
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,580
- That's a lot of driving. Let's go.
- I'll drive for a while.

434
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,480
- No, no. I got it.
- No. I gotta learn how to do this.

435
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,580
You're doing it.
How hard can it be?

436
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,590
- Push the stick down hard.
- I'm pushing hard.

437
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,090
<i>Okay. Okay, there you go.</i>

438
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,760
Now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.

439
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:56,240
It's on the floor.
The floor.

440
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,939
Sticking on there.

441
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:08,909
Push down hard.

442
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,079
Well, you've got a problem.

443
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,279
Your clutch is, uh, shot.

444
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,689
Can we get a new one?

445
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,289
<i>These old buses, you-
you have to order the part.</i>

446
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,959
How long does it take?

447
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,299
Well, it's the weekend...

448
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,638
so... maybe... Thursday.

449
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:54,148
Is there a, uh,
dealership around here?

450
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,918
Well, uh, they're
probably gonna be closed.

451
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:58,968
It's, uh-
It's the weekend, you know.

452
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,827
Yes, we're aware of that.

453
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:05,997
I'll tell you what.
You know these- these old buses?

454
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:10,977
You don't need the clutch to change from-
from the third to the fourth.

455
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,107
You only really need the clutch to go
from number one to number two.

456
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:18,577
<i>But as long as you keep
parking on a hill...</i>

457
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:22,777
<i>and you let it go, and it goes
15, 20 miles per hour...</i>

458
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,647
you start her in third,
and you go from third to fourth.

459
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:28,816
What if you're not
on a hill? There's no hill.

460
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:31,156
What if there's no hill?
What do you-

461
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,526
Yeah, it's-

462
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,966
Olive, Dad, I want you
in the car first.

463
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:45,806
- I know. We know.
- All right, here we go!

464
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,276
Everybody push!
All right.

465
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:55,486
<i>Here we go! Push! Push!</i>

466
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:59,295
Ok- Ok- Okay!

467
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:02,065
I just want everyone here to know...

468
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:04,695
that I am the preeminent
Proust scholar in the United States.

469
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,235
<i>Here we go!</i>

470
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,305
<i>- Go on, honey.
- I'm putting it in gear!</i>

471
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,965
<i>- Go, honey!
- Come on!</i>

472
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:13,975
Come on, Olive!
Run! Run! Come on!

473
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,985
- Come on!
- Sheryl, let's go!

474
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:19,215
Sheryl!

475
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,255
<i>- Frank, let's go!
- I'm coming.</i>

476
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:27,194
<i>- You're losing them. Slow down!
- I can't slow down!</i>

477
00:32:27,294 --> 00:32:30,624
- Come on! Come on! Come on, you dumb bastard!
- I can't. I can't slow down.

478
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:33,094
- I can't slow down!
- Let's go!

479
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:35,864
<i>Help him. Come on!</i>

480
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,734
Come on. Come on. Get in.

481
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,174
No one gets left behind.

482
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,534
- Close the door!
- No one gets left behind!

483
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:47,344
Outstanding, soldier!
Outstanding!

484
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:55,213
Outstanding.

485
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:57,513
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.

486
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:49,732
<i>So finally I'm just sitting there...</i>

487
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,771
and I decide, you know,
"This is Stan Grossman. What the hell?"

488
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:55,241
And I start pitching him
the nine steps.

489
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:59,071
<i>And about- I don't know-
two minutes in, he stops me, he says...</i>

490
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,581
"I can sell this. "

491
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,581
<i>Mm-hmm. Interesting.</i>

492
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,281
Yeah, and this is the guy
who knows how to do it.

493
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:11,091
You start with a book, and then you do a media
tour, corporate events, DVD, VHS series.

494
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:14,961
<i>I mean, there's a whole fascinating science
into how you roll these things out.</i>

495
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:18,261
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale right now, you know...</i>

496
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:22,030
<i>building the buzz and kind of getting
the whole hype thing going.</i>

497
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,370
<i>He's doing what the pros call
a ticking clock auction.</i>

498
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,540
Oh, how about that!

499
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,950
Yeah, and I can detect
that note of sarcasm there, Frank.

500
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,860
What sarcasm? I didn't-
I didn't hear it.

501
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,990
But I want you
to know something.

502
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,000
I feel sorry for you.

503
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,030
You do? Good.

504
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,370
<i>Yeah, I do. Because sarcasm
is the refuge oflosers.</i>

505
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,909
<i>- It is? Really?
- Yep.</i>

506
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,409
Sarcasm is losers trying to bring
winners down to their level...

507
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,039
and that's step four in the program.

508
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:58,879
Wow, Richard, you've really opened
my eyes to what a loser I am.

509
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:02,209
- How much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom?
- That one's on the house.

510
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,149
<i>- Okay, you guys, that's enough.
- It's on the house.</i>

511
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,419
- That was for free?
- No charge. No charge.

512
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:09,859
- Stop it!
- He started it.

513
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,359
<i>That's- Oh, wait a second.</i>

514
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:15,229
<i>- You are so bad.
- Quiet. This is it. This is that call.</i>

515
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,429
He-Hello?

516
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,898
Stan?

517
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,898
Stan?

518
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:32,738
Stan Grossman?
Richard Hoover.

519
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:35,818
Finally. How're ya doin'?

520
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:39,118
No, I know. We were, uh, on the highway,
and I lost you on my cell.

521
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:41,348
Forget about it.
How'd we do?

522
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:50,957
Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies' room.
You need to go?

523
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,897
No. I'm gonna go practice
my routine over there.

524
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:55,967
Okay, well, don't go too far.

525
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,197
<i>Well, I think that wejust
gotta talk to him a little.</i>

526
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,297
No, you gotta talk to him.

527
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:04,307
<i>No, Stan, listen to me.
Hold on now.</i>

528
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,847
<i>I am going to get something to drink.
You want anything?</i>

529
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:10,407
<i>- Stay positive and-
- Yeah, get me some porn.</i>

530
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,417
Okay.

531
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:15,917
Get me something really nasty too.
I don't want any of that airbrushed shit.

532
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:18,926
- Okay.
- Okay, here's a 20. Get yourself a little treat too.

533
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:22,586
- Get yourself a fag rag.
- All right. I will.

534
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:28,326
<i>Uh, that one. Yes. And that one.</i>

535
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,766
And I would like
that one- No, down.

536
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:35,436
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I would like that one.

537
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:38,236
And, uh, I will have a-

538
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:41,106
a blue raspberry Slushee.

539
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:43,236
Frank?

540
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:46,115
<i>Oh, my God! How are you?</i>

541
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:49,115
- Uh- - I thought you were gonna
be in Santa Fe for the conference.

542
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,125
<i>I was looking for you.</i>

543
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,955
<i>- Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven?
- Yeah.</i>

544
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:57,185
- Well, you heard about Larry and the whole genius thing, right?
- Yeah.

545
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:59,765
- It's official.
- Oh, good.

546
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:02,455
So we're going to this private
spa in Sedona for the week-

547
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:04,545
- Larry's here?
- Yeah.

548
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:08,775
- He's out filling the tank. He's, uh-
- Oh. Yeah, there he is.

549
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:12,375
Wow. I can't believe this.
How have you been?

550
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:15,384
I've been fine.

551
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,394
Good. Good.

552
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:22,124
You know, I heard
that you got fired.

553
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,724
Yeah. No, I quit, 'cause
enough is enough, you know?

554
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,204
Right. Good. Good.

555
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:30,064
So what are you up to now?

556
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:33,144
Um, I'm weighing my options...

557
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:38,734
and, um, just, you know,
taking some time off, and so-

558
00:37:38,844 --> 00:37:40,904
Great. That's great.

559
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:43,613
<i>$ 19.79, sir.</i>

560
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:48,383
So-

561
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:54,663
- Well, it was great to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

562
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:57,093
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

563
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,663
<i>Bye.</i>

564
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:29,192
<i>Hey.</i>

565
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,262
<i>You forgot your Slushee.</i>

566
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:36,232
You're in Scottsdale right now, right?

567
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:38,232
Okay, I can come by.

568
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:41,461
I'm gonna be coming through there.
I could swing right by. We could-

569
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,441
Christ.
He's not getting it.

570
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,081
<i>Did you try that?</i>

571
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:54,451
<i>Listen to what
I'm saying, Stan! I'll-I'll-</i>

572
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,321
So what happened?

573
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:04,551
Nothing.
Let's get out of here.

574
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,461
Wait a minute. I thought
you said this was a done deal.

575
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:10,500
- He said it was a done deal.
- What, you didn't get anything?

576
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,570
Oh, my God!
Where does that leave us?

577
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,570
Fucked.
That's where it leaves us.

578
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,230
- I can't believe I'm hearing- Did you even
try negotiating? - Yes! Of course I tried!

579
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,640
What do you think I-

580
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,740
Let's just go, okay?
Let's go. Let's go.

581
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,750
Come on.

582
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,020
Let's go!

583
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:10,798
"Where's Olive?"

584
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:14,568
Oh!

585
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,808
<i>All right, Frank.</i>

586
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,718
- Come on, Olive.
- Come on, Olive.

587
00:40:27,818 --> 00:40:30,018
Come on, sweetie, jump.
Jump in the car.

588
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:32,718
- We can't stop. Jump.
- I got her! I got her!

589
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:55,737
Richard.

590
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:58,977
Yeah.

591
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:02,947
Whatever happens, you tried
to do something on your own...

592
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:05,716
which is more than
most people ever do...

593
00:41:05,826 --> 00:41:08,446
and I include myself
in that category.

594
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:14,426
You took a big chance.
That took guts, and I'm proud of you.

595
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:19,796
Okay, Dad.
Thank you.

596
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:32,016
Thank you, Dad.

597
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:08,274
<i>Okay, here is 11.</i>

598
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:10,474
Frank, you're 12.

599
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,784
And Grandpa's 13.

600
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:16,804
Can I sleep with Grandpa tonight?

601
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,964
Well, you'll have to ask Grandpa.

602
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:21,434
- Grandpa?
- I got two beds.

603
00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:23,534
You could still use some rehearsing.

604
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,804
<i>Yeah, that's what I was thinking.</i>

605
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,013
All right, everybody,
we have a long day tomorrow.

606
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:38,053
I'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a. m.

607
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:40,713
That means no lollygagging.

608
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:43,483
We need to be packed
and on the road by 7:40, guys.

609
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:45,963
- Frank, you guys'll be okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

610
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,963
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

611
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,663
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

612
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:09,672
What a fucking nightmare.

613
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,082
Richard, we-
we have to talk.

614
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,092
Please.

615
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:21,692
Sheryl, let's just
get through this and go home.

616
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:24,092
<i>No, Richard, we have to talk now!</i>

617
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,962
<i>I tried to tell you
we couldn't afford this trip!</i>

618
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:30,061
<i>- Do you realize we're becoming bankrupt?
- We are not bankrupt!</i>

619
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:33,731
<i>Hey, don't listen to that.</i>

620
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:36,241
Let's turn on the tube.

621
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:40,441
<i>- We agree that the right man to preserve
the traditions- - I'm gonna brush my teeth.</i>

622
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,181
Secretary Rumsfeld and I
thought long and hard...

623
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:45,381
<i>about this important choice.</i>

624
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:47,391
To me-

625
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,321
<i>You said this was a lock!
You said it was a done deal!</i>

626
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:52,791
<i>Stan Grossman said it was a done deal!</i>

627
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,991
<i>I'm not married to Stan Grossman!</i>

628
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:58,330
<i>I trusted him! You gotta trust
to be trusted! That's step six!</i>

629
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,830
<i>Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard!</i>

630
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,270
<i>They're not working!
Forget it! It's over!</i>

631
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,530
<i>I never want to hear
about the nine steps again!</i>

632
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,380
Perfect. Perfect. You're
the world champion growler.

633
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,050
Time for your beauty rest.
Get in there.

634
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:29,499
There you go.

635
00:44:30,759 --> 00:44:32,659
Good night.

636
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,829
<i>- Grandpa?
- Yeah.</i>

637
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,059
I'm kinda scared about tomorrow.

638
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,829
Are you kiddin' me?
You're gonna blow 'em out of the water.

639
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:44,209
They're not gonna know
what hit 'em.

640
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:47,249
<i>- Grandpa?
- Yeah.</i>

641
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,419
Am I pretty?

642
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,928
<i>Olive, you are...</i>

643
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,428
the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

644
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,868
Nah, you're just saying that.

645
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:01,958
No, I'm not. I'm madly
in love with you.

646
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:04,868
And it's not because of your brains
or your personality.

647
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:08,308
It's because you're
beautiful, inside and out.

648
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:12,108
- Grandpa?
- What?

649
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:18,808
- I don't want to be a loser.
- You're not a loser.

650
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:21,718
Where'd you get the idea
you're a loser?

651
00:45:21,828 --> 00:45:25,157
Because Daddy hates losers.

652
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:27,557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up a minute.

653
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,557
You know what a loser is?

654
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:35,467
A real loser is somebody that's so afraid
of not winning, they don't even try.

655
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,407
- Now, you're trying, right?
- Yeah.

656
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:43,497
Well, then, you're not a loser.
We're gonna have fun tomorrow, right?

657
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:47,167
Yeah.

658
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,977
We can tell 'em all to go to hell.

659
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:52,746
Good night, sweetie.
I love you.

660
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,266
What are you doing?

661
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:19,606
I'm gonna fix this.

662
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:23,985
Richard-

663
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:27,255
I'm gonna fix this.

664
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:58,874
Here we go.
Here we go.

665
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:25,643
Hi.

666
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:43,721
Hi. Stan Grossman, please.

667
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,800
Stan, it's Richard.
I don't know where the fuck you are.

668
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,060
I'm at the hotel.
Call me.

669
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,089
But it's funny.

670
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:20,619
<i>So I said, "You want me to teach you
about life experiences?</i>

671
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:23,819
You can write a book
about my experiences. "

672
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,699
So he says to me-

673
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,539
Hello, Stan.

674
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,769
You're the one
that said it would sell!

675
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,779
That's what I thought at the time.

676
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:38,139
But it's a great program.
You said so yourself. I don't understand.

677
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:42,209
It's not the program, Richard.
It's you. Okay?

678
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:47,218
No one's heard of you.
Nobody cares.

679
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:56,158
What's the next step?

680
00:49:56,268 --> 00:49:59,288
There is none.
We had our shot.

681
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:02,098
It didn't fly.
We move on.

682
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,278
- You-You mean give up?
- Richard.

683
00:50:05,388 --> 00:50:09,648
Hey, wh-Whoa, hey! One setback here,
and you're ready to just quit?

684
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:12,877
Richard, listen.
I pushed this thing hard, okay?

685
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:16,787
I rammed it down their fucking throats,
and no one bought it!

686
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:21,697
It's time to move on.
You're not gonna win this one.

687
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,237
Okay. Okay.
You know what?

688
00:50:26,337 --> 00:50:29,597
Good. I'm glad.
You know why?

689
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:32,137
Because this is what
the nine steps are all about.

690
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:34,177
- Right here, Stan. Right here!
- Richard.

691
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:35,677
<i>- Richard, please.
- You blew it!</i>

692
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:38,217
You blew it.
You're out.

693
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:50,846
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

694
00:50:54,796 --> 00:50:58,026
What is it, hon?

695
00:50:58,136 --> 00:51:00,366
Grandpa won't wake up.

696
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:17,755
Want to take an eye test?

697
00:51:19,085 --> 00:51:21,385
Uncle Frank?
An eye test?

698
00:51:23,925 --> 00:51:26,085
Olive, come here.
Put those away.

699
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:29,185
We're gonna have a family meeting.
Dwayne, family meeting.

700
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:35,625
First of all...

701
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:39,834
the doctors are doing everything they can
to help Grandpa right now.

702
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:44,004
He's had a long, eventful life...

703
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:47,244
and I know he loves
both of you very much.

704
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:52,014
<i>But if God wants to take him,
we have to be ready to accept that, okay?</i>

705
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:58,224
<i>Whatever happens,
we're a family.</i>

706
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:02,794
And what's important
is that we love each other.

707
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:06,624
I love you guys so, so much.

708
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:29,453
Look at this.
This is a 15-pound turkey.

709
00:52:29,553 --> 00:52:32,543
It does it in three hours' time.

710
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:37,822
Are you the family of Edwin Hoover?

711
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:39,842
Yes.

712
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:46,072
I'm sorry.
We did everything we could.

713
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:49,082
He was, uh-

714
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:51,712
Well, it was too much.

715
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:55,082
He probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.

716
00:52:57,162 --> 00:53:00,922
I'll have someone come talk to you
about handling the remains.

717
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,271
Thank you.

718
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:18,971
Linda!

719
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:26,281
Mom?

720
00:53:26,391 --> 00:53:28,291
Is Grandpa dead?

721
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:31,651
Yeah, honey.
He passed away.

722
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,670
<i>That's what this
machine does. Chicken, fish or beef.</i>

723
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,640
<i>So you always look forward
to eating the food.</i>

724
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,230
<i>And that, I believe-</i>

725
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,970
<i>Put it in the machine.
Center it. Turn it around.</i>

726
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,170
Hi. I'm your
bereavement liaison, Linda.

727
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,409
- My consolations for your loss.
- Thank you.

728
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:05,859
Okay, these are the forms
you need to fill out.

729
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:08,549
A death certificate.

730
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:11,759
A report of death.
An M.E. Pink slip.

731
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:14,829
Please try and be
as detailed as possible.

732
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:17,029
Um, this is a brochure...

733
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:20,109
for a grief recovery support
group that meets on Tuesdays.

734
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:23,229
And, if you like, at this time,
I can refer you to a funeral home...

735
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,279
so you can begin making
your own arrangements.

736
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:29,339
Actually, prearrangements
have already been made in Albuquerque.

737
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:34,318
- Albuquerque?
- We're actually on our way to California right now.

738
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:39,258
If the body is crossing state lines,
you're gonna need a burial transit permit.

739
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,518
Okay, but we're trying
to get to Redondo Beach by 3:00.

740
00:54:42,628 --> 00:54:46,688
3:00 today? Hmm.
Ain't gonna happen.

741
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:50,988
Okay, um, can I just-

742
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:54,668
I know that this is, uh-
this might be a little unusual...

743
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:57,268
but if maybe we could just go.

744
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:00,777
And then we'll come back, and we'll
take care of all the paperwork and-

745
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:02,807
No. You can't just abandon the body.

746
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:06,647
<i>No, no, no. Nobody's gonna abandon
the body. We're gonna go and-</i>

747
00:55:06,747 --> 00:55:09,047
Otherwise, the hospital
becomes responsible.

748
00:55:09,157 --> 00:55:11,487
<i>Sir, there are ways
we have of doing things.</i>

749
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:13,487
We're gonna go and come back.

750
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:17,397
You are not the only one that's
had somebody die here today, okay?

751
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:26,507
Is there any way we might
be able to view the remains?

752
00:55:31,646 --> 00:55:35,386
We haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs...

753
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:39,716
so someone may come in in a few minutes
to take him to the basement.

754
00:55:39,826 --> 00:55:42,726
Just tell them who you are,
and they will wait.

755
00:55:42,826 --> 00:55:44,766
- Thank you.
- Okay?

756
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:48,766
And when you're done with the paperwork,
I'll be at the nurses' station.

757
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:51,306
- Great. Thank you, Linda.
- Thank you.

758
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:32,764
Goddamn it, Dad.
Goddamn it!

759
00:56:34,814 --> 00:56:36,714
Stupid.

760
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:49,144
We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine
next year, okay, honey?

761
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:51,164
<i>Next year.</i>

762
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:04,333
No. No.
We've come 700 miles.

763
00:57:04,443 --> 00:57:07,843
I will be damned if I'm not
making that contest, Sheryl.

764
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:10,503
Well, Richard,
we can't leave him here.

765
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:16,073
We're not gonna leave him.

766
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:20,923
- Richard, what are you doing?
- Fuck.

767
00:57:26,632 --> 00:57:28,922
- Dwayne, go around outside.
- Richard, what are you thinking?

768
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:31,902
<i>- We're gonna take him with us.
- No, no. That is not happening.</i>

769
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:34,062
He's better off with us
that these people.

770
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:36,532
<i>I want you to go around outside
and underneath this window.</i>

771
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:38,542
<i>Dwayne, don't you dare move.</i>

772
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:41,802
Honey, you stay here.
We'll take Olive. Frank can drive.

773
00:57:41,912 --> 00:57:46,472
No, Sheryl, we'll be there in two hours.
I'll call a funeral home once we get there.

774
00:57:46,582 --> 00:57:48,812
If there's one thing
my father would have wanted...

775
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:51,792
<i>it's to see Olive perform
in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.</i>

776
00:57:51,892 --> 00:57:55,761
<i>Now, I believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory...</i>

777
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,831
if we were to just give up now.

778
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:01,301
All right? There's two kinds
of people in this world.

779
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:04,811
<i>There's winners and there's losers. Okay?
You know what the difference is?</i>

780
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,901
Winners don't give up.

781
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:10,641
So what are we here?
Are we winners, or are we losers?

782
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,911
<i>Huh?</i>

783
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:15,851
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's do it.

784
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,851
You guys go. Olive,
you watch the curtain.

785
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,190
I don't know. I have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.

786
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,320
Watch. Get the back.
Get the back.

787
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,530
Shh. Go, go, go.

788
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,330
<i>Yeah, 1:00.</i>

789
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,640
Now?

790
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,800
- He's very heavy. Be gentle.
- Mm-hmm.

791
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,210
<i>Now!</i>

792
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,720
<i>One, two-</i>

793
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,119
Okay, three.
Wait, wait, wait!

794
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:53,749
<i>Not yet. Not yet.</i>

795
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:57,879
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.
- Shh, shh, shh. Okay.

796
00:58:57,989 --> 00:59:00,189
<i>Richard, I can't do it!</i>

797
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,229
- I got him. I got him.
- Come on.

798
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:04,559
Come on!
Hurry up!

799
00:59:08,909 --> 00:59:11,929
Okay, he's slipping.
Okay.

800
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:15,569
Hold on.

801
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:18,169
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

802
00:59:21,348 --> 00:59:23,408
Be careful.

803
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:30,318
- Be cool. Be cool.
- Hurry up.

804
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:33,658
Keep watch, Olive.

805
00:59:34,898 --> 00:59:37,588
Watch the curb.
Watch the curb.

806
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:46,028
Watch his head!
Watch it!

807
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:48,297
<i>Keys.</i>

808
00:59:51,807 --> 00:59:54,717
<i>Swing him around this way.</i>

809
00:59:54,817 --> 00:59:57,117
<i>- Olive, get in.
- Here we go.</i>

810
00:59:57,217 --> 00:59:59,147
Okay, let's go.

811
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:05,417
Sheryl. Let's go, Frank.

812
01:00:05,527 --> 01:00:09,117
Did I mention that I am the preeminent
Proust scholar in the U. S?

813
01:00:09,227 --> 01:00:13,127
Here we go! Here we go!

814
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:15,637
Are you okay?

815
01:00:23,406 --> 01:00:25,876
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey?

816
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,756
What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

817
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:55,875
Uncle Frank?

818
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,955
Yeah?

819
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:01,745
Do you think there's a heaven?

820
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:08,755
That's hard to say, Olive.
L- I don't think anyone knows for sure.

821
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:12,425
<i>I know, but what do you think?</i>

822
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:16,294
Um, well-

823
01:01:16,404 --> 01:01:18,374
I think there is one.

824
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:23,044
- You think I'll get in?
- Yes.

825
01:01:23,144 --> 01:01:25,234
- Promise?
- Yes.

826
01:01:38,624 --> 01:01:41,614
Whoa! Hey! Son of a bitch!

827
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:44,563
- What happened?
- He- He cut me off.

828
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,963
<i>- It's stuck.
- Okay, just leave it.</i>

829
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:53,473
It's stuck or something.

830
01:01:53,573 --> 01:01:56,973
- Maybe-Try pulling it from under here.
- No, no. Just leave it.

831
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:01,473
<i>- Fix it when we get there.
- Okay, fine.</i>

832
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,383
Shit!

833
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:10,383
Oh, Jesus! God!

834
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,422
<i>I'm being pulled over.
Here we go.</i>

835
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:19,062
Okay. Everybody just
pretend to be normal, okay?

836
01:02:19,162 --> 01:02:22,032
<i>Like-Like everything's normal here.</i>

837
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:37,352
How you folks doin'?

838
01:02:37,452 --> 01:02:41,251
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
Just-

839
01:02:41,351 --> 01:02:44,381
- Little trouble with the horn?
- Sorry. What?

840
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:46,961
- Havin' a little trouble with your horn?
- Yeah.

841
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:51,621
Little trouble. Sorry.
Uh, sorry.

842
01:02:51,731 --> 01:02:54,751
Could you step outside
the vehicle?

843
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:06,111
- Step this way, please.
- No, no.

844
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:08,811
- What?
- Don't-

845
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:11,120
"Don't" what?

846
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:16,590
- Do you have something in your trunk, sir?
- It's nothing. L-

847
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,720
- Don't- Don't open it. - You've just given
me probable cause to search your trunk.

848
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,930
- Just- I- I just-
- Put your hands on the vehicle now! Now!

849
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,030
- Don't move.
- Okay.

850
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,900
- It's not illegal!
- Sir, I would advise you to keep your mouth shut!

851
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,749
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

852
01:03:44,459 --> 01:03:47,289
<i>- It's not illegal.
- Goddamn.</i>

853
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,729
Sir, could you come back here?

854
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,478
I love this stuff. I love it.

855
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,608
God bless ya.
God bless ya.

856
01:04:09,718 --> 01:04:12,078
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bust ya.

857
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:14,648
Oh, thank you.

858
01:04:14,748 --> 01:04:17,378
How you doin'?

859
01:04:19,988 --> 01:04:22,928
- Cute- Cute family. That's nice.
- Thank you.

860
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:26,228
- This on the side. A little of
this, a little of that. - It's-

861
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:28,558
- Oh, man.
- Sweet- Sweetness.

862
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:30,828
That is sweet. Yeah.

863
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:34,338
- Dirty.
- And this one is one of my favorites.

864
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:36,567
Ahh, good, yeah.

865
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:40,607
<i>That's a little different choice.</i>

866
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:45,407
No?

867
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:49,677
- Gonna leave that with ya.
- All right.

868
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:52,547
- You have a good day there.
- Yeah.

869
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,436
What happened?

870
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:10,026
<i>I'll tell you when I regain consciousness.</i>

871
01:05:12,336 --> 01:05:15,776
Frank, Dwayne, get out and push.

872
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:36,425
Okay, there it is- Redondo Beach, 46.

873
01:05:36,535 --> 01:05:38,875
It's 2:15.
Might be a few minutes late.

874
01:05:38,975 --> 01:05:43,605
<i>They said 3:00 sharp. They were very explicit.
We can't cross these people. Trust me.</i>

875
01:05:43,715 --> 01:05:46,775
- Mom, Dwayne has 20/20 vision.
- I bet he does.

876
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:50,255
- Okay, now I'm gonna check
to see if you're color blind.

877
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:52,485
<i>Asshole!</i>

878
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:56,545
What's the letter in the circle?

879
01:05:59,225 --> 01:06:01,725
<i>No, no, no.
Inside the circle.</i>

880
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:04,094
<i>Right there. See?</i>

881
01:06:04,204 --> 01:06:07,964
It's an "A." Can't you see it?
Right there.

882
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:13,174
It's bright green.

883
01:06:15,774 --> 01:06:17,674
Oh, man.

884
01:06:26,324 --> 01:06:29,524
Dwayne, I think you
might be color blind.

885
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,433
You can't fly jets
if you're color blind.

886
01:06:55,613 --> 01:06:58,953
We've got a little bit of-
Okay, got an emergency back here.

887
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,522
- I think we need to pull over.
- What is it?

888
01:07:01,622 --> 01:07:04,282
<i>- What's the emergency?
- Pull over.</i>

889
01:07:04,392 --> 01:07:07,222
<i>It's all right, man. Dwayne, Dwayne!
It's all right. Hold on.</i>

890
01:07:07,332 --> 01:07:09,792
- Just pull over the car!
- Okay! All right!

891
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:13,332
- Could you get him to pull over, please?
- Richard, pull over!

892
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:16,132
- Richard, pull over the car!
- It's all right. We're pulling over.

893
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:18,332
- I'm pulling over. Stop it.
- It's all right.

894
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:22,462
- Dwayne! No, no. Dwayne. Sit down.
- God, this better be good.

895
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,242
<i>- Pull over.
- I'm pulling over. All right.</i>

896
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:28,782
- Stop the car. It's gonna be okay, Dwayne.
- All right. Don't open the door.

897
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:30,851
Dwayne? Oh, God!

898
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:36,891
Fuck!

899
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:44,961
- What happened?
- He's color blind. He can't fly.

900
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,461
Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.

901
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,671
Uh, just-
just give him a second.

902
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,740
Dwayne?

903
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,740
Dwayne, honey, I'm sorry.

904
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:35,179
- Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
- I'm not going.

905
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:40,619
- Dwayne-
- I said I'm not.

906
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:44,999
Okay? I don't care.
I'm not getting on that bus again.

907
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:47,299
Dwayne, for better or worse,
we're your family.

908
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,199
<i>No, you're not my family!
Okay? I don't wanna be your family!</i>

909
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:55,498
I hate you fucking people!
I hate you!

910
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:58,978
Divorce, bankrupt, suicide!

911
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:02,518
<i>You fucking losers!
You're losers!</i>

912
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,548
No. Please
just leave me here, Mom.

913
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:11,588
Okay?
Please, please, please.

914
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,328
Please just leave me here.

915
01:09:27,537 --> 01:09:29,507
Shit.

916
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:34,537
I don't know what to do.

917
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:37,547
<i>Well, it's gettin'late.</i>

918
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:40,587
Maybe- Can somebody
stay here with him?

919
01:09:40,687 --> 01:09:43,847
- I'll stay.
- Oh, that is not happening.

920
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,857
All right. Well...

921
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:50,927
uh...

922
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:54,086
I'm just worried about the time.

923
01:09:57,036 --> 01:09:59,666
Olive, you, uh-

924
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:01,896
you wanna try talking to him?

925
01:10:02,006 --> 01:10:05,276
Richard, no! There is nothing to say.
We just have to wait.

926
01:10:05,376 --> 01:10:07,846
Honey-

927
01:10:57,004 --> 01:10:58,974
Okay.

928
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:02,774
Let's go.

929
01:11:33,673 --> 01:11:36,733
I apologize for the things I said.

930
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:41,283
I was upset.
I didn't really mean them.

931
01:11:43,683 --> 01:11:46,673
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go.

932
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:53,092
2:55.

933
01:11:53,192 --> 01:11:55,682
All right. Everybody,
look for the exit, okay?

934
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,992
Okay, here! Here's the turnoff.
Turn in here.

935
01:12:02,102 --> 01:12:04,532
Does anybody see
the Redondo Suites?

936
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:07,972
<i>- There's the hotel!
- There it is! There it is, Olive.</i>

937
01:12:08,072 --> 01:12:11,842
<i>We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it. All right.</i>

938
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:15,672
How- How the hell
do you get over there?

939
01:12:15,782 --> 01:12:18,641
<i>- Sheryl?
- No, no, no, no!</i>

940
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,771
<i>- You're passing it!
- Turn around, turn around.</i>

941
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:25,481
- You drove past it!
- You've gotta turn around!

942
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,781
- It's back there!
- I can't turn around.

943
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,651
- Anybody see a way back? It's a one-way street!
- Oh!

944
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:34,821
Rich! You've got parking lots on the right!

945
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:37,991
<i>- Here, here!
- Put your seat belt on, baby!</i>

946
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:40,731
- What are you doing?
- I can't slow down! I can't!

947
01:12:40,841 --> 01:12:43,671
- What time is it, Frank?
- Oh, 2:59.

948
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:46,940
- Dad!
- Straight shot from here. We're gonna make it.

949
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,510
- Oh, it's a dead end!
- I'm not goin' back!

950
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,310
- You have to go back!
- That is a one-way road!

951
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,380
That'll take us all the way
back to the freeway!

952
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,220
- You're the one who told me
to go left back there!

953
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,810
I'm not turnin' back.

954
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,910
<i>- Richard!
- It's right there.</i>

955
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,320
What-What are you doing?
You can't do this!

956
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,600
- God, Richard!
- Okay, here's the hotel.

957
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,360
<i>Okay, stop!</i>

958
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,529
<i>- Where's the entrance?
- Right here!</i>

959
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:18,569
You passed it!
You're passing it!

960
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:20,639
Hold on!

961
01:13:22,309 --> 01:13:24,439
Here we go. One more time.
Little bump.

962
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:33,189
Mom!

963
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:15,567
Hello?
Hi. We'd like to register.

964
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:19,367
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Uh, no. We have the entrant right here.

965
01:14:19,477 --> 01:14:22,937
- We just wanna check in.
- Registration ended at 3:00.

966
01:14:23,047 --> 01:14:25,917
- It's 3:00 now.
- No.

967
01:14:26,017 --> 01:14:30,177
Come on. Have a heart. We're four minutes late.
We just drove all the way from Albuquerque.

968
01:14:30,287 --> 01:14:32,757
- Then you should've been here by 3:00.
- Wait, wait.

969
01:14:32,857 --> 01:14:35,547
There must be some way
we can work this out. Please.

970
01:14:35,657 --> 01:14:38,817
<i>Everybody else was here before 3:00.
I'd be giving unfair advantage.</i>

971
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:41,986
No, we're not looking for an advantage.
We just want her to compete.

972
01:14:42,096 --> 01:14:44,586
Don't yell at me, sir.
I didn't make you late.

973
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:47,966
We've settled on the schedule for the show.
We've turned off the computers.

974
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,266
- Our lineup is final. I have a hair check to do.
- Okay-

975
01:14:51,376 --> 01:14:54,566
I'm sorry that you're late,
but I can't help you.

976
01:14:55,806 --> 01:14:57,936
Please.

977
01:14:59,646 --> 01:15:03,046
You don't know
what we've been through.

978
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:10,525
<i>Um, Miss Jenkins?
L- I can put 'em in the system.</i>

979
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:14,955
<i>- Oh, Kirby, you don't have to.
- No, it's okay. Takes five minutes.</i>

980
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:18,515
Well, it's your time.
Excuse me.

981
01:15:18,635 --> 01:15:20,995
<i>Thank you, Kirby.
Thank you very much.</i>

982
01:15:21,105 --> 01:15:23,195
<i>Really, you don't know
what this means.</i>

983
01:15:23,305 --> 01:15:25,295
Please, it's only five minutes.

984
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,395
I am not working for these people
next year. These people are crazy.

985
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,305
<i>Okay, so, what's your name?</i>

986
01:15:32,415 --> 01:15:34,845
<i>- Olive.
- That's a nice name.</i>

987
01:15:34,945 --> 01:15:38,345
<i>- Mom, Mom! Look!
- What's her last name?</i>

988
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:41,144
- It's Miss California. It's really her!
- You want to go say hi?

989
01:15:41,254 --> 01:15:43,224
<i>Albuquerque-</i>

990
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:48,284
<i>- Thank you.
- Bonnie, come here.</i>

991
01:15:48,394 --> 01:15:51,594
- Hi! What's your name?
- Olive.

992
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:55,154
- What's your talent, Olive?
- I like dancing.

993
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,864
Dancing was too hard for me.
I'm a singer.

994
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:00,164
You must be a good dancer.

995
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:02,304
I am. I'm really good.

996
01:16:02,414 --> 01:16:04,584
<i>I bet you are.</i>

997
01:16:04,684 --> 01:16:07,553
Well, thanks for stopping by,
Olive. Best of luck.

998
01:16:09,623 --> 01:16:12,723
Hmm. Miss California?

999
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:16,233
- Do you eat ice cream?
- I love ice cream.

1000
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:19,633
My favorite flavor is
Chocolate Cherry Garcia...

1001
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:23,763
<i>although, technically,
I think that's a frozen yogurt.</i>

1002
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:27,363
- Okay?
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.

1003
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:29,943
Bye.

1004
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:33,573
- Mom, she eats ice cream.
- I heard.

1005
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:38,782
Your packet has tickets in it,
and there's your badge number.

1006
01:16:38,882 --> 01:16:40,852
- Okay.
- Is there anything else?

1007
01:16:40,952 --> 01:16:43,582
Uh, yeah. Is there a funeral home
around here?

1008
01:16:58,502 --> 01:17:01,172
- Hi.
- Hi.

1009
01:17:03,072 --> 01:17:05,571
<i>Okay, Olive,
let's get your swimsuit on.</i>

1010
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:07,801
You wanna go change
behind the curtain?

1011
01:17:07,911 --> 01:17:11,251
<i>This is the last touch-up, everybody.
Final touch-ups. Last touch-up.</i>

1012
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,280
<i>- Okay! Wait!
- I won't wait for you!</i>

1013
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,290
Let's get outta here.

1014
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,390
Hey! Hey, Olive Hoover.

1015
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:59,190
- Mm-hmm?
- Hey, I need your music.

1016
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,860
- Oh, music, right.
- Yeah.

1017
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:06,869
Where is it? All right.

1018
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:11,279
Here you go.

1019
01:18:11,379 --> 01:18:14,779
- This? Did you choose this?
- No, my grandpa did.

1020
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:16,849
- Your grandpa?
- Mm-hmm.

1021
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:18,919
- Which track?
- Twelve.

1022
01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:23,819
We were drivin' five, six hours.
Thought he was napping.

1023
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:26,479
By the time we figured it out, it's-

1024
01:18:27,589 --> 01:18:29,619
- You know.
- Too late.

1025
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:33,888
So where's the body?

1026
01:18:33,998 --> 01:18:35,968
Um-

1027
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:53,128
Personal effects.

1028
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,198
- Thank you.
- You take care.

1029
01:18:56,828 --> 01:18:58,858
You too.

1030
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:22,517
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1031
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:23,847
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1032
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:31,026
- She was scared, but she did very well.
- Was she?

1033
01:19:35,096 --> 01:19:39,556
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

1043
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:42,662
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

Hey.

1045
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:50,402

<i>You got a kid in the show?</i>

1047

Your first time?

01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,711
Yeah, yeah.

1049
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,920
<i>America!</i>

01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:58,099
<i>Sometimes I just wish
I could go to sleep till I was 18...</i>

1052
01:22:58,209 --> 01:23:03,339
and skip all this crap- high school
and everything-just skip it.

1053
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:08,219
You know Marcel Proust?

1054
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:10,839
- He's the guy you teach.
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:14,319
French writer.
Total loser.

1056
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:16,479
Never had a real job.

1057
01:23:16,589 --> 01:23:19,818
Unrequited love affairs. Gay.

1058
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,858
Spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads.

1059
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:25,258
But he's also probably
the greatest writer since Shakespeare.

1060
01:23:25,368 --> 01:23:29,738
Anyway, he, uh-
he gets down to the end of his life...

1061
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,898
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered-

1062
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:37,168
Those were the best years of his life,
'cause they made him who he was.

1063
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:41,178
All the years he was happy? You know,
total waste. Didn't learn a thing.

1064
01:23:41,278 --> 01:23:45,478
So, if you sleep until you're 18...

1065
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:49,047
ah, think of the suffering
you're gonna miss.

1066
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:52,827
I mean, high school? High school-
Those are your prime suffering years.

1067
01:23:52,937 --> 01:23:55,407
You don't get better suffering
than that.

1068
01:23:59,377 --> 01:24:01,347
You know what?

1069
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:05,117
Fuck beauty contests.

1070
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:09,717
Life is one fucking
beauty contest after another.

1071
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:13,377
You know, school,
then college, then work?

1072
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:15,457
Fuck that.

1073
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:17,686
And fuck the Air Force Academy.

1074
01:24:17,796 --> 01:24:21,926
If I wanna fly,
I'll find a way to fly.

1075
01:24:22,026 --> 01:24:24,966
You do what you love,
and fuck the rest.

1076
01:24:30,906 --> 01:24:33,206
I'm glad you're talkin' again, Dwayne.

1077
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:38,306
You're not nearly as stupid as you look.

1078
01:24:45,656 --> 01:24:47,615
Wanna go back?

1079
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:50,125
Not really.

1080
01:24:51,525 --> 01:24:54,355
Yeah, we should go back.

1081
01:24:56,865 --> 01:25:00,265
<i>And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for-</i>

1082
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:02,765
the talent competition.

1083
01:25:13,845 --> 01:25:15,784
Miss Carly Nugent.

1084
01:25:44,943 --> 01:25:47,373
Yee-haw!

1085
01:25:47,483 --> 01:25:50,043
<i>Yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great!</i>

1086
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,693
<i>Wow-ow-ow-ow!</i>

1087
01:26:09,803 --> 01:26:12,273
<i>Funky-licious!</i>

1088
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:36,032
<i>I'm goin' backstage.</i>

1089
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:38,102
Yeah, right. See ya.

1090
01:26:41,342 --> 01:26:44,571
Oh, look at you.
Is that your costume?

1091
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:46,641
Mm-hmm.

1092
01:26:47,681 --> 01:26:49,671
Okay, here.

1093
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:55,951
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Oh, I just- I came to wish Olive good luck.

1094
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:58,421
- How you doin', honey?
- Good.

1095
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:00,461
- Nervous.
- Yeah. You're gonna do great.

1096
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:03,251
I just know it.

1097
01:27:03,361 --> 01:27:06,191
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

1098
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:08,771
What's up?

1099
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,930
I don't want her to go on.

1100
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:18,810
- Are you authorized to be backstage?
- No. Hey.

1101
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:21,380
<i>- Where are the dressing rooms?
- Are you allowed to be here?</i>

1102
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,450
Just tell me where
the dressing rooms are.

1103
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:27,710
<i>Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore.</i>

1104
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,150
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Better. Where's Olive?

1105
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,720
- There. What's up?
- Mom, I don't want Olive doing this.

1106
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,160
Oh, my God!

1107
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,780
- Look around. This place is fucked!
- He's right!

1108
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,589
Look, I don't want these
people judging Olive. Fuck them!

1109
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:44,229
- Listen, it is too late.
- No, it's not too late. You're the mom...

1110
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:46,999
and you're supposed to protect her.

1111
01:27:47,099 --> 01:27:52,169
Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom.
Please don't let her do this.

1112
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:55,109
<i>Olive Hoover, two minutes.</i>

1113
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:58,079
<i>Look, she's not a beauty queen.</i>

1114
01:27:58,179 --> 01:28:00,309
<i>She's just not.</i>

1115
01:28:00,419 --> 01:28:04,319
- I'm gonna tell her.
- No, Dwayne. You listen to me. Olive is who she is.

1116
01:28:04,419 --> 01:28:06,949
<i>She has worked so hard.
She's poured everything into this.</i>

1117
01:28:07,059 --> 01:28:11,048
We can't just take it away
from her. We can't.

1118
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:16,158
I know you wanna protect her. I know, honey,
but... we gotta let Olive be Olive.

1119
01:28:16,268 --> 01:28:19,598
<i>Olive Hoover. Are you the family?</i>

1120
01:28:19,698 --> 01:28:21,728
Yeah. Okay?

1121
01:28:23,438 --> 01:28:26,268
Olive, it's time. Okay?

1122
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:28,438
Yeah.

1123
01:28:28,548 --> 01:28:31,208
- We gotta go now.
- Hang on.

1124
01:28:31,318 --> 01:28:34,378
Olive, look at me.

1125
01:28:34,488 --> 01:28:37,387
If you don't want to do this,
that's okay.

1126
01:28:37,487 --> 01:28:42,047
If you want to sit this one out, it's totally
fine by us. We're proud of you anyway.

1127
01:28:43,157 --> 01:28:45,127
<i>We gotta go.</i>

1128
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:49,327
<i>It's time.</i>

1129
01:28:58,577 --> 01:29:00,547
Ready? Let's go.

1130
01:29:12,466 --> 01:29:14,556
Good luck, honey.

1131
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:17,226
Copy that. Twenty-five
is performance ready...

1132
01:29:17,336 --> 01:29:19,466
and we're walkin'...

1133
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:21,536
as fast as we can.

1134
01:29:24,246 --> 01:29:26,206
- Is she going on?
- Yeah.

1135
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:28,276
She's going on.

1136
01:29:31,316 --> 01:29:33,286
<i>Pure fairy-tale magic.</i>

1137
01:29:33,386 --> 01:29:35,575
Miss Charisma Whiteman!

1138
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:38,785
Wasn't that a stardust fantasy?

1139
01:29:38,955 --> 01:29:42,895
<i>Thank you for that.
You have been such a patient audience.</i>

1140
01:29:42,995 --> 01:29:45,985
<i>We have one more contestant,
and then we'll be crowning our winner.</i>

1141
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:48,625
<i>Please give a warm welcome to...</i>

1142
01:29:48,735 --> 01:29:52,425
<i>Miss... Olive Hoover!</i>

1143
01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:08,884
You okay?

1144
01:30:08,984 --> 01:30:13,254
Um, I'd like to dedicate this
to my grandpa...

1145
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:15,584
who showed me these moves.

1146
01:30:15,694 --> 01:30:18,424
<i>Oh, that is so sweet!</i>

1147
01:30:18,524 --> 01:30:21,394
<i>Is he here?
Where is your grandpa right now?</i>

1148
01:30:21,494 --> 01:30:24,834
In the trunk of our car.

1149
01:30:24,934 --> 01:30:26,904
Okay!

1150
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,474
<i>Well, take it away, Olive!</i>

1151
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,613
Huh!

1152
01:31:21,992 --> 01:31:24,652
<i>You suck!</i>

1153
01:31:24,762 --> 01:31:27,522
<i>Those little fuckers. I will kill them.</i>

1154
01:31:27,632 --> 01:31:29,861
<i>You stink!</i>

1155
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:40,011
No, no, no, no, no.

1156
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:13,280
What is your daughter doing?

1157
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:23,520
She's kickin' ass.
That's what she's doin'.

1158
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,709
Get over here!
Get over here!

1159
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:44,739
<i>- I want that little ragamuffin off the stage this minute.
- All right.</i>

1160
01:32:44,849 --> 01:32:47,309
- Get her. Right this minute!
- Don't touch- Don't touch her.

1161
01:32:47,409 --> 01:32:50,979
- Your act's over, honey.
- Hey!

1162
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:56,118
- Hey! Hey, let go of my daughter!
- Oh!

1163
01:32:56,218 --> 01:32:59,658
Holy sh-

1164
01:32:59,758 --> 01:33:02,518
Let her finish!

1165
01:33:04,398 --> 01:33:07,828
<i>Get off me!
Help! Get off me!</i>

1166
01:33:07,938 --> 01:33:10,458
- Help me!
- Take charge! Just take charge!

1167
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:12,798
<i>Keep dancin', honey!
Daddy's okay.</i>

1168
01:33:12,908 --> 01:33:18,108
Get your daughter
off this stage right now!

1169
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,178
Now!

1170
01:33:25,287 --> 01:33:27,247
<i>Honey?</i>

1171
01:33:44,407 --> 01:33:46,367
<i>- Like that?
- Oh!</i>

1172
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,935
- Ooh!
- Ah!

1173
01:34:51,215 --> 01:34:54,904
Yeah! All right!

1174
01:35:10,194 --> 01:35:12,924
Okay, you're out-

1175
01:35:13,034 --> 01:35:16,224
on the condition that you never enter
your daughter in a beauty pageant...

1176
01:35:16,334 --> 01:35:18,764
in the state of California ever again.

1177
01:35:18,874 --> 01:35:20,833
Ever.

1178
01:35:23,043 --> 01:35:25,333
I think we can live with that.

1179
01:35:30,113 --> 01:35:33,273
All right.
We're back in business.

1180
01:35:33,383 --> 01:35:36,043
Lock and load.

1181
01:35:49,102 --> 01:35:52,432
Olive, your grandpa would've
been really proud of you.

1182
01:35:52,532 --> 01:35:55,432
<i>- Yeah, you were great. Mm-wah!
- You were beyond great.</i>

1183
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:59,062
<i>- You were incredible.
- Thank you.</i>

1184
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:04,612
Let's get outta here.

1185
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:30,601
Whoo!

1186
01:36:33,211 --> 01:36:35,141
It's in gear.

1187
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,970
What in the world?
