His trick is topnotch.

and then he reappears instantly

on the other side
of the stage, mute, overweight

949
01:05:04,012 --> 01:05:06,572
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

950
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:10,140
It's astonishing. How does
he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

951
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:13,677
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage?

952

It's killing him. He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

He thinks of nothing else,
takes no pleasure in our success.

is performing right across the street.

Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

964
01:05:57,065 --> 01:06:00,057
Root. He's realized
that he can make demands.

a lot longer to figure it out.

- My point is, you've climbed too high

professional embarrassment.

974

We don't do any tricks we can't control.

975
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:37,168
Just pay him for now. We keep
doing the trick until Borden opens,

976
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:39,207
and then we'll phase it out.

Your method for The Transported man.

Write down your method,
Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

Our answer, Cutter. I haven't

1115
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:54,420
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1116
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:57,583
Same way he always has,
the same way as we do.

It's just that you want something more.

Well, let's find out then, shall we?

Yes, Freddie, what trick?

myself alive every night,

- Don't ruin this evening.

- That's my name.

taken off the beard?

Sarah, I just came from

All right? I'm out in public.
Everybody else loves it.

I thought that
something very precious...

1153

...had been lost to me.

1154

So I just wanted
to celebrate just a little.

No, that's what he told
me to tell you. The truth...

1174
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:57,896
...is that I loved him and I stood by
him and he sent me to you,

1175

like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

So, what could you
possibly have to offer me?

You may know his tricks,

but you can't understand why
no one sees yours are better.
