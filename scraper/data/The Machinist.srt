1
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,162
Who are you?

2
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:39,864
Jesus.

3
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,249
You ok?

4
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,419
Do I look ok?

5
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,880
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

6
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,760
No...

7
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,145
Trevor...

8
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,982
You still got half an hour.

9
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,859
I can fix you some eggs.

10
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,613
I am tired but thanks.

11
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:20,280
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

12
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,869
Come on guys, keep it moving.

13
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,289
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

14
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,502
Hey, why is that machine down!

15
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:39,463
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

16
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,756
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

17
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:43,341
Your paycheck?

18
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:48,763
- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
- What regulations?

19
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:54,476
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries,

20
00:06:56,602 --> 00:07:01,564
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

21
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:12,240
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

22
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:22,289
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

23
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:25,709
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

24
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,168
That is right.

25
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,378
So then, she stopped

26
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:32,423
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

27
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:36,969
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

28
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,223
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

29
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,724
Man, that's bullshit!

30
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:49,479
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

31
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:52,982
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

32
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,108
You might, I don't!

33
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,401
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,903
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

35
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,112
Can't, got plans.

36
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:05,367
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you? you used to be alright.

37
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,995
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

38
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:12,539
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

39
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:16,918
Who! hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

40
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,962
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

41
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:24,757
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

42
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:29,553
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

43
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:51,446
You ok?

44
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,407
Do I look ok?

45
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,119
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

46
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:02,580
What's wrong?

47
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,499
I don't know, deja vu.

48
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:10,253
You are tired, you need to sleep.

49
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,765
How do you do it?

50
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:25,557
What?

51
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,434
Sleep so little and still look so good.

52
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,436
Are you flirting with me?

53
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,395
Commiserating

54
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,026
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?

55
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,986
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

56
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,155
You had that last night.

57
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,657
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

58
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,285
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

59
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,913
What else do you know about me?

60
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:55,998
That you are lonely.

61
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:02,588
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

62
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:09,135
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:14,639
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

64
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:15,389
Check please

65
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,340
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

66
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,804
How are you doing, Reznik?

67
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:47,889
What is this about?

68
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,391
Frankly I am concerned about you.

69
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,978
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

70
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,609
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

71
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:05,195
- Anything we can help with?
- No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

72
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:08,448
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

73
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,365
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

74
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:16,537
Where is Stewart?

75
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,372
He couldn't make it

76
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,041
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union
- See what I mean.

77
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,254
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

78
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,047
Then I will just get back to work

79
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,508
Er... Trevor, not yet.

80
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,802
I need to ask you for a UA

81
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:51,699
Look like rain.

82
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,751
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

83
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,965
they said right.

84
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,758
I'd say it's already here.

85
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:20,097
You are on the first shift?

86
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,058
- Yeah
- Me too

87
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:29,104
Funny I never seen you before.

88
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,364
I've been here.

89
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,402
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

90
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,611
Where is Reynolds?

91
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,450
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

92
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,373
I am Ivan.

93
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,462
Trevor

94
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,561
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

95
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:11,514
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

96
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:13,348
You got that right.

97
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,268
I will see you around.

98
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,083
what is wrong?

99
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,253
I just want to lie here.

100
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:51,546
We can do that.

101
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:56,843
I'm... so... tired

102
00:16:57,677 --> 00:17:01,347
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

103
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:04,933
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

104
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,267
Nothing helps.

105
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,772
Don't worry about it honey.

106
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,440
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

107
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,692
Stevie

108
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,157
I haven't slept in a year.

109
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:34,666
Jesus Christ!

110
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,209
I tried him too...

111
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,382
I am sorry.

112
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,719
Hello?

113
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:56,934
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

114
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:05,649
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

115
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,987
Trevor, I am worried about you.

116
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:16,283
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

117
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:22,414
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

118
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,541
Geee... thanks

119
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:30,920
Reznik, I need a hand

120
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,762
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

121
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,933
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

122
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,355
How is that?

123
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:55,690
A little to the left.

124
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:08,533
Do I need more?

125
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,371
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

126
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,540
Better, now try the other side.

127
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,584
I hate this bitch.

128
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,314
Hey! what did you do?

129
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:49,150
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

130
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:53,862
- Come on, kill it.
- Not working.

131
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,780
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

132
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:57,616
- Kill it!
- Not working

133
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:02,620
God! Jesus!

134
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,163
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

135
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:06,956
Hit the breaker!

136
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,673
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

137
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,717
We need some help

138
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,764
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

139
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:28,891
Call an ambulance!

140
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:31,519
What happened here?

141
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,895
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

142
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:34,938
You thought?!

143
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,233
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

144
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:49,999
Shit!

145
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:22,776
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

146
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:28,572
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

147
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,365
I will give you a receipt in the morning

148
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,951
Good night mr. Reznik.

149
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,036
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

150
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:40,124
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

151
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:45,044
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

152
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:50,466
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

153
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,216
Unusual?

154
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,721
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

155
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,475
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

156
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:10,064
What we know is this:

157
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:15,778
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

158
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:21,617
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

159
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:24,827
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

160
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:29,122
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

161
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,215
What is the fucking point?

162
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:44,384
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

163
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:47,970
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

164
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:51,599
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

165
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:55,852
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

166
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,314
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

167
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,691
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

168
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,151
I was distracted.

169
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,655
By what?
What distracted you?

170
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,288
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

171
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:22,040
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

172
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,542
Who did you say?

173
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,670
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

174
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:31,173
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

175
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:34,676
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

176
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,843
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

177
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,389
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

178
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:45,351
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

179
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:05,784
What is this?

180
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:10,080
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

181
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:20,387
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

182
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:21,804
No

183
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
- Trevor
- Yeah

184
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:27,059
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

185
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:31,146
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

186
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:33,230
Is it all the way?

187
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:36,817
An airport? For coffee and pie?

188
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:39,652
Suppose I went to Danni's...

189
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:43,198
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

190
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,949
Could I do that just in any diner?

191
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,328
Is someone chasing you?

192
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:53,873
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

193
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:57,209
Oh really! Who are you?

194
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,586
Can you keep a secret?

195
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:02,505
To the grave.

196
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:04,423
I am Elvis Presley.

197
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:08,927
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

198
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,554
I thought you looked familiar.

199
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:22,396
Got plans for mother's day?

200
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:25,482
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

201
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,985
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

202
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:31,403
That is ok, when he is older

203
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:33,322
I will let him make it up to me.

204
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,949
A little guilt goes a long way.

205
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:37,408
How about you?

206
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,159
Cemetery

207
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:43,413
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

208
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,833
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

209
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,670
I am not so good at losing family.

210
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:52,671
Who is?

211
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,551
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

212
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:03,179
I pictured her while buying it...

213
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:07,141
...Not knowing it would...

214
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,142
You know, be the one.

215
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,646
Seems unfair, isn't it?

216
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:16,691
Not knowing things like that

217
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:25,031
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

218
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,122
Sounds dreamy

219
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,025
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

220
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:12,361
Armed robbery.

221
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,239
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

222
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,492
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

223
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,789
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

224
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,753
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

225
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:34,045
You made me nervous.

226
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:39,258
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

227
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,009
Nothing is up with me.

228
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:44,763
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

229
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:50,392
You ain't hearing me, man.

230
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,354
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

231
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,372
See you tomorrow.

232
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:34,553
Hey

233
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:09,790
Howdy, partner.

234
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:12,960
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

235
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:16,088
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

236
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:20,466
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

237
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,345
We need to talk.

238
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:29,139
Follow me.

239
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,066
Come on!

240
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,952
Another Bourbon.

241
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,624
Make it double.

242
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,801
You shooting coke or something?

243
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,431
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

244
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:23,059
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

245
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,685
How about abnormally?

246
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:30,314
I see Reynolds is back to work.

247
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:34,067
Gets to me bail

248
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,447
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

249
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:43,075
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

250
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,909
They ain't get to live to be honest.

251
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:48,872
Where they hiding you these days?

252
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:51,707
Around

253
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:58,921
Hey, you wanna see something?

254
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:07,345
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

255
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:12,767
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

256
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:15,351
That is why I walk with a gimp.

257
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:21,607
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

258
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,696
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

259
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,743
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

260
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:40,164
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

261
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:41,915
You believe that?

262
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:46,419
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

263
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:48,879
I am not laughing.

264
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:56,844
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

265
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,555
That ain't my problem.

266
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:07,269
You caused the accident, not me.

267
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,399
Where are you going?

268
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,489
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

269
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:25,492
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

270
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:10,446
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

271
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,407
What time is it?

272
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,826
How are they biting Reynolds?

273
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:26,417
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

274
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,378
I could use it.

275
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:34,382
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

276
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:36,223
Trevor?

277
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,684
I need to see you, Stevie.

278
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:45,523
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

279
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:49,444
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

280
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:52,613
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

281
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:56,699
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

282
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,995
Ok, give me a minute.

283
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:08,542
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

284
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:12,587
My pleasure.

285
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:17,424
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

286
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:24,555
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

287
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:28,975
Some kind of... plot.

288
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:36,065
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

289
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:39,400
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

290
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:44,739
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

291
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:49,034
Their eyes, their little games.

292
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,204
What?

293
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:59,292
E R.. E R..

294
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:04,046
- T U C K E R
- Trevor?

295
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:06,005
TUCKER?

296
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:11,719
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

297
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,761
I mean...

298
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:20,101
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

299
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,769
I am not worried about being fired.

300
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,605
Then what are you worried about?

301
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,025
I don't know yet.

302
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,538
There you go, made to order.

303
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:47,289
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

304
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:52,335
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

305
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:54,921
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

306
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:58,298
By the carousel.

307
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:01,259
Just a minute.

308
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,014
Okay, ready.

309
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:09,433
Smile!

310
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,774
It helps if you push the button.

311
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,322
Trevor? What is it?

312
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:39,624
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

313
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:43,002
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

314
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,800
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

315
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:54,386
Could you...?

316
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:58,682
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

317
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:07,272
How long have you known my mother?

318
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:09,398
About a year.

319
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:13,359
How did you meet her?

320
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:15,445
We just kind of met.

321
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:19,490
Are you going to see her again?

322
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:20,866
I hope so.

323
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,744
Would you like that?

324
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:24,911
I guess so

325
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,749
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

326
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:32,209
What?

327
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:37,172
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

328
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:40,174
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

329
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:43,968
You will realise that too some day.

330
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:45,303
What is that?

331
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,513
Monster ride.

332
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:51,517
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

333
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:56,562
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

334
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:58,021
Can we go in?

335
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:02,025
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

336
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,234
What for?

337
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:07,404
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

338
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:15,452
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

339
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,165
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

340
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:25,002
Fill her up, cowboy.

341
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:35,844
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

342
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:53,191
Eww.. look at that.

343
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:59,530
You should close your eyes.

344
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:12,582
Jesus!

345
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:22,132
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

346
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,137
Shady Lady

347
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:33,349
Oh, my God.

348
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:35,935
Stop!

349
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,060
Woo

350
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:56,744
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

351
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:31,147
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

352
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:47,577
I need some help here.

353
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,538
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

354
00:43:52,248 --> 00:43:54,041
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

355
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,124
Nicolas!

356
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:05,675
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

357
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:08,052
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

358
00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:12,472
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

359
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,266
It is ok, baby.

360
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:32,781
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

361
00:44:33,281 --> 00:44:35,741
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

362
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,576
It's ok, it's not your fault.

363
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:42,789
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

364
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,214
Wanna come in?

365
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,799
I think you could use a drink.

366
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:43,547
I hope wine is okay with you.

367
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:47,341
That'll work.

368
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:55,181
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

369
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:57,766
I will have to remember that.

370
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,695
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

371
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,031
Should my lawyer be present?

372
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:22,537
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

373
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:26,081
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

374
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,000
And entertainment.

375
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:31,252
- Entertainment?
- You.

376
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:36,924
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

377
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:41,470
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

378
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,766
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

379
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:49,184
Hmmm?

380
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:52,060
That is a deal.

381
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,902
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

382
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,237
I will get it.

383
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,657
- You wait on me.
- Thanks

384
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,704
It is the last door on the left.

385
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:51,340
Reznik

386
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,553
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

387
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:02,266
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

388
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:18,737
Shit!

389
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:38,837
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

390
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,173
Bye. See you now.

391
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:45,969
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

392
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:48,929
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

393
00:51:49,013 --> 00:51:50,180
Yeah, man, take it easy.

394
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:55,643
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

395
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:59,729
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

396
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:02,649
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

397
00:52:06,277 --> 00:52:09,113
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

398
00:52:09,488 --> 00:52:12,156
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

399
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,448
Fair is fair

400
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:17,744
We are just razzing you, kid

401
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:21,113
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

402
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:25,367
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

403
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:26,993
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

404
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:30,914
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

405
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:36,835
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

406
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:40,004
I will see you around, pal.

407
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,201
Ah!

408
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,036
Hey!

409
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,245
Help!

410
00:53:27,502 --> 00:53:28,335
Hey!

411
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:29,753
Hey!

412
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:34,799
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

413
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:50,353
Reznik

414
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:51,437
Ah...

415
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,438
I got ya, I got ya.

416
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,481
Be cool, be cool, alright?

417
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,862
Who did it, huh?

418
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,948
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

419
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:06,074
Was it all of you?

420
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,368
Was it you, Jones?

421
00:54:08,702 --> 00:54:10,285
Was it you? Was it you?

422
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:11,578
Or was it you?

423
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,622
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

424
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,834
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

425
00:54:17,543 --> 00:54:22,088
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

426
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,012
Where is it?

427
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,264
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

428
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:39,017
Get him off me!

429
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,813
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

430
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,189
You are fired.

431
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:55,739
This motherfucker's crazy.

432
00:54:56,324 --> 00:54:57,658
You lost it, man.

433
00:55:18,843 --> 00:55:19,718
Shit!

434
00:55:28,642 --> 00:55:29,976
Damn it! Where is it?

435
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,234
Asshole!

436
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:43,654
What the fuck did you do with it?

437
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:47,282
Idiot!

438
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:17,730
Hey! Fuck you!

439
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:20,233
Get out!

440
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:37,914
What?

441
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,626
It's an occupational hazard.

442
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:06,646
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

443
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:16,070
I could give it up for the right guy.

444
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:24,453
Oh, that came out wrong.

445
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:29,081
What I mean is...

446
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:37,004
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

447
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,842
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

448
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:50,974
I think I'd like that.

449
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:15,793
Mr. Reznik.

450
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,462
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

451
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,130
You leave me in such a scare.

452
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:26,010
What are you doing in my apartment?

453
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,637
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

454
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:30,347
That's impossible.

455
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:32,683
I'm gonna leave a note.

456
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:34,684
A note? What kind of note?

457
01:00:35,477 --> 01:00:36,644
About the leak.

458
01:00:38,354 --> 01:00:39,896
What's that terrible smell?

459
01:00:40,398 --> 01:00:41,940
There is no leak in this apartment.

460
01:00:41,941 --> 01:00:44,199
Now if you would excuse me...

461
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:44,900
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

462
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:48,862
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

463
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:16,350
Miller!

464
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:18,977
Hey, Reznik.

465
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:21,563
It's a pleasant surprise.

466
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:23,647
We need to talk.

467
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:25,858
Take a look at this, huh?

468
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:27,943
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

469
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:31,654
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

470
01:02:31,655 --> 01:02:32,697
I need to be doing something.

471
01:02:32,698 --> 01:02:34,747
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

472
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:39,494
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

473
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:43,581
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

474
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:49,044
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

475
01:02:50,378 --> 01:02:52,254
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

476
01:02:57,217 --> 01:02:59,093
Is there some place we can talk?

477
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:06,642
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

478
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,769
8 cylinders

479
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:14,022
Speed sensitive steering

480
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,616
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

481
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:22,738
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

482
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:24,322
Of course, it's automatic.

483
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:25,573
Hell I wanted a stick...

484
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:28,993
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

485
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:33,705
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

486
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:35,206
Yeah, I heard about it.

487
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:37,416
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

488
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:40,795
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

489
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:42,295
Ironic?

490
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:45,465
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

491
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:48,092
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

492
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:51,011
Moments after you left the shop,

493
01:03:51,046 --> 01:03:52,887
someone powered up my machine.

494
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:54,847
With my arm in it.

495
01:03:55,516 --> 01:03:56,724
I nearly got killed.

496
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:58,100
Accidents happen.

497
01:03:58,101 --> 01:03:59,142
It wasn't an accident.

498
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:03,021
Accidents happen out of negligence

499
01:04:04,064 --> 01:04:06,023
This happened down the spike.

500
01:04:06,024 --> 01:04:07,692
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

501
01:04:07,727 --> 01:04:08,608
Spike.

502
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:12,570
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

503
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,364
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

504
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:15,698
I am onto you Miller.

505
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:19,076
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

506
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:21,744
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

507
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:23,162
How did you get into my place?

508
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:24,789
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

509
01:04:24,824 --> 01:04:26,748
Fuck you, Miller!

510
01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:27,999
This shit is gonna stop!

511
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,175
Get off my property, punk!

512
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:02,319
Bastards.

513
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:17,999
Shit.

514
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,137
Come on.

515
01:06:13,712 --> 01:06:15,275
7-4...

516
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,838
...3-C-R

517
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,423
It's 743CR.

518
01:06:27,598 --> 01:06:28,348
What?

519
01:06:32,185 --> 01:06:32,976
Shit.

520
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,069
Fuck!

521
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,039
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

522
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:51,825
...motor's information to the general public.

523
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:53,160
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

524
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:54,912
This guy is a friend of mine.

525
01:06:55,621 --> 01:06:58,039
But you don't know your firend's address?

526
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,958
We just met, I don't know him that well.

527
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,752
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

528
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,629
I just want talk to him.

529
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,590
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

530
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:10,633
Has a crime been committed?

531
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,221
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

532
01:07:16,256 --> 01:07:18,263
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

533
01:07:26,063 --> 01:07:28,064
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

534
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:31,525
I don't see any bruises.

535
01:07:31,526 --> 01:07:33,402
If you did,
would you give me an address?

536
01:07:34,569 --> 01:07:36,195
No, but the police might.

537
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,657
I want to report a hit and run.

538
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:36,669
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

539
01:10:17,161 --> 01:10:18,328
Mr. Reznik.

540
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,498
You sure about these plate numbers?

541
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:25,876
743CR. All right, that's the one.

542
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:28,544
Do you ever have a car stolen?

543
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:30,713
No, what?

544
01:10:31,589 --> 01:10:33,840
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

545
01:10:34,801 --> 01:10:40,097
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

546
01:10:40,597 --> 01:10:43,015
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

547
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,651
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

548
01:10:58,861 --> 01:11:01,363
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

549
01:11:01,364 --> 01:11:02,322
Hey! Hey!

550
01:12:32,062 --> 01:12:34,272
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

551
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:40,403
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

552
01:14:08,517 --> 01:14:09,225
Trevor?

553
01:14:12,478 --> 01:14:13,186
Oh, no.

554
01:14:20,485 --> 01:14:22,069
Trevor, what do you want?

555
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:27,073
Trevor, it's okay.

556
01:14:32,161 --> 01:14:33,620
Oh God, what happend?

557
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,166
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

558
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:43,044
Did he stop?

559
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,590
No, he just kept going.

560
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:50,801
He fucking hit my drivers man.

561
01:14:51,468 --> 01:14:53,344
He gotta be hanged.

562
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,104
It was my fault.

563
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:58,473
I wasn't paying attention.

564
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:01,226
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

565
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:04,145
You may have some internal injuries.

566
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:05,855
it is just bruises.

567
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:07,731
Okay, you see this?

568
01:15:08,315 --> 01:15:11,693
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

569
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:15,779
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

570
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:19,907
I trust you.

571
01:15:21,368 --> 01:15:23,536
Now I know.
You are crazy.

572
01:15:25,246 --> 01:15:26,663
Can I stay here tonight?

573
01:15:27,707 --> 01:15:29,708
Babe, you can stay here every night.

574
01:15:31,251 --> 01:15:32,334
You know that?

575
01:15:34,795 --> 01:15:35,628
What?

576
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:39,799
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

577
01:15:41,718 --> 01:15:43,385
I really want this to work, Stevie

578
01:15:47,264 --> 01:15:48,055
But?

579
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:52,351
You know so little about me.

580
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:56,521
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

581
01:16:00,567 --> 01:16:02,651
I will buy you a flea collar.

582
01:16:08,907 --> 01:16:09,865
I love you.

583
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,081
Stevie

584
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:19,956
Yeah.

585
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,499
Thanks.

586
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:40,891
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

587
01:16:41,642 --> 01:16:43,517
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

588
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:48,439
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

589
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:51,232
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

590
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,652
Hey, perfect fit.

591
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,862
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

592
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,740
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

593
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,533
Hey, how about that idea.

594
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:05,160
I can get a job selling man's wear.

595
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:08,872
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

596
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:11,165
I'll settle for that.

597
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:14,168
That's not a bad life.

598
01:17:14,669 --> 01:17:16,544
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

599
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:21,257
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

600
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:24,802
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

601
01:17:24,803 --> 01:17:28,472
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

602
01:17:28,507 --> 01:17:30,223
And I wanna do more of that.

603
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:33,266
I would love to paint a place.

604
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:38,772
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

605
01:17:41,066 --> 01:17:45,111
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

606
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:14,885
Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

607
01:18:15,385 --> 01:18:16,510
Not a lot to ask.

608
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:23,934
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

609
01:18:27,353 --> 01:18:30,605
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

610
01:18:33,733 --> 01:18:34,859
Not even my husband.

611
01:18:38,529 --> 01:18:39,946
Jesus Christ.

612
01:18:41,365 --> 01:18:42,282
Where is he?

613
01:18:44,492 --> 01:18:45,159
Who?

614
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:46,368
You know who.

615
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:51,122
- Trevor.
- Don't.

616
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:55,626
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

617
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,753
This, Ivan.

618
01:18:59,796 --> 01:19:01,547
He's your ex, isn't he?

619
01:19:01,548 --> 01:19:02,631
What?

620
01:19:02,632 --> 01:19:04,049
Why is he doing this?

621
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:06,635
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

622
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,970
Now it all makes sense.

623
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:11,973
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

624
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:12,848
Where is he?

625
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:15,017
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

626
01:19:15,018 --> 01:19:17,186
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

627
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:19,270
Ah, don't babe me.

628
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,023
Yeah, babe.

629
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:26,985
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

630
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,031
You know what, I don't deserve this.

631
01:19:32,324 --> 01:19:33,199
What did you do?

632
01:19:33,866 --> 01:19:36,993
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

633
01:19:36,994 --> 01:19:37,911
Fuck you!

634
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:40,920
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

635
01:19:40,955 --> 01:19:44,166
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

636
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:49,837
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

637
01:19:50,588 --> 01:19:54,925
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

638
01:19:54,926 --> 01:19:56,635
I'm talking about your ex!

639
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:57,843
Ivan.

640
01:19:58,887 --> 01:20:04,515
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

641
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,810
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

642
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,648
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

643
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:22,948
That's not me.

644
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:32,581
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

645
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,129
You lying whore.

646
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,884
You get the fuck out.

647
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,678
Fucking freak.

648
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,763
You are a fucking pig

649
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:53,847
You fucking whore

650
01:20:53,848 --> 01:20:56,641
You are a fucking freak.

651
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:59,435
You are a fucking psycho.

652
01:20:59,436 --> 01:21:19,703
Fucking psycho

653
01:21:48,768 --> 01:21:51,562
Where is Marie?

654
01:21:51,597 --> 01:21:52,854
Who?

655
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:55,898
You know who.

656
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:58,950
Marie my waitress.

657
01:21:58,985 --> 01:22:02,967
My! You are chatty tonight.

658
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:06,949
Darling, I am your waitress!

659
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,741
What's going on here?

660
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,722
I've never seen you before.

661
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:11,703
What are you talking about?

662
01:22:11,704 --> 01:22:16,916
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

663
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:22,171
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

664
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:24,804
I wanna see Marie!

665
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:30,051
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

666
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:37,106
Is everybody at it?

667
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:42,353
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

668
01:22:42,896 --> 01:22:46,398
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

669
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:50,423
Go home, Mister.

670
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:54,447
Get some sleep.

671
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:25,021
How could you!

672
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:50,013
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

673
01:25:50,048 --> 01:25:55,052
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

674
01:25:55,053 --> 01:26:00,266
What have you done with Nicholas?

675
01:26:00,932 --> 01:26:06,187
What have I done with Nicholas?

676
01:26:11,066 --> 01:26:16,279
He can't hear you now, pal.

677
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:22,742
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

678
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:31,082
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

679
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:35,426
Might make life a little bit easier.

680
01:26:35,461 --> 01:26:40,673
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

681
01:26:44,636 --> 01:26:49,848
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

682
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:56,519
Where is your hospitality, partner?

683
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:07,278
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

684
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:16,675
Who are you?

685
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:23,306
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

686
01:30:28,652 --> 01:30:30,152
I know who you are.

687
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:42,552
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

688
01:32:44,847 --> 01:32:47,765
Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving.

689
01:32:48,683 --> 01:32:49,850
I didn't receive notice.

690
01:32:50,685 --> 01:32:53,520
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

691
01:32:54,563 --> 01:32:57,023
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

692
01:32:57,773 --> 01:33:01,526
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

693
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:09,617
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

694
01:33:10,993 --> 01:33:12,535
I just don't understand it.

695
01:33:25,671 --> 01:33:27,005
Oh, isn't that pretty?

696
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,759
Would you care to sell it?

697
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:36,639
No, it was my mother's.

698
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:44,687
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

699
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:45,729
You just want to get away...

700
01:33:46,105 --> 01:33:49,837
If you are going to give it away...

701
01:33:49,872 --> 01:33:53,569
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

702
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:53,076
I like to report a hit-and-run.

703
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,091
Some one will record your statement.

704
01:35:12,134 --> 01:35:17,762
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

705
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:28,063
Just want to sleep.
