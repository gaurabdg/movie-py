2
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,520
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

3
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,390
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

4
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,100
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

5
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,800
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

6
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,370
If M was so sure that I was bent...

7
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,510
...she'd have sent a double-0.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,920
Benefits of being section chief...

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,780
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

10
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,280
...wouldn't I?

11
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,880
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
Shame.

13
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,510
We barely got to know each other.

14
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,740
I know where you keep your gun.

15
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,780
I suppose that's something.

16
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,150
True.

17
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,390
How did he die?

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,060
Your contact?

19
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,760
Not well.

20
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,710
Made you feel it, did he?

21
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,950
Well...

22
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,380
...you needn't worry.

23
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,510
The second is...

24
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,330
Yes.

25
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,190
Considerably.

26
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,400
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

27
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,170
You asked for the introduction.

28
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,600
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

29
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,680
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

30
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,150
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

31
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,050
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

32
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,130
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

33
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,960
No.

34
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,830
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

35
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,300
I want no risk in the portfolio.

36
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,770
Agreed.

37
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,770
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

38
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,170
Yes.

39
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,360
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

40
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,220
...of Skyfleet stock.

41
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,300
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

42
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,670
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

43
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,570
Just do it.

44
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,810
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

45
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,010
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

46
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,270
He's on the move.

47
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,370
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

48
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,260
Stop touching your ear.

49
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,530
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

50
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,510
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

51
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,660
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

52
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,260
...my dear general.

53
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,490
Nothing sinister.

54
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,130
All in.

55
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,060
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

56
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,370
...of making your straight.

57
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,140
When does Ellipsis expire?

58
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,500
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

59
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,440
That's all the time I have anyway.

60
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,380
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

61
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,880
...or throw them overboard.

62
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,190
Who the hell do they think they are?

63
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,890
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

64
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,300
...not to ask me what we do.

65
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

66
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,210
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

67
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,070
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

68
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,150
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

69
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,750
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

70
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,480
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

71
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,310
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

72
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,350
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

73
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,630
You've got a bloody cheek.

74
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,330
Sorry.

75
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,340
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

76
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,200
Or yourself.

77
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,430
You stormed into an embassy.

78
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,170
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

79
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,970
...of international relationships.

80
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,120
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

81
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,010
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

82
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,420
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

83
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,680
I did.

84
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,880
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

85
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,890
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

86
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,920
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

87
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,620
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

88
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,960
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

89
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,400
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

90
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,440
And thanks to your trigger finger...

91
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,510
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

92
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,050
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

93
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,840
The same way
I found out your name.

94
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,990
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

95
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,660
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

96
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,850
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

97
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,330
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

98
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,730
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

99
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,880
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

100
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,450
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

101
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,780
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

102
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,850
Any thug can kill.

103
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,460
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

104
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,180
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

105
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,160
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

106
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,990
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

107
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,230
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

108
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
...and think about your future.

109
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,910
Because these bastards
want your head.

110
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,570
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

111
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,910
And Bond...

112
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,920
...don't ever break into
my house again.

113
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,800
Ma'am.

114
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,340
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

115
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,580
Hey. Hey.

116
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,390
Hello.

117
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,720
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

118
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,230
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

119
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,580
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

120
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,480
Absolutely incredible.

121
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,070
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

122
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,720
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

123
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,320
Okay.

124
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,190
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

125
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,560
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

126
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,720
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

127
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,030
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

128
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,670
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

129
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,610
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

130
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,510
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

131
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,350
But if I felt compelled to find him?

132
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,610
He has a house just up the beach.

133
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,550
Thank you.

134
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,350
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

135
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,990
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

136
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,160
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

137
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,420
...using your name and password.

138
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,490
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

139
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,060
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

140
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,130
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

141
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,160
That slimy bugger.

142
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,650
Now known associates...

143
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
Le Chiffre.

144
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,880
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

145
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,550
How can I assist you, sir?

146
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,980
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

147
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,820
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

148
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,250
Yeah.

149
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,100
Do you mind if I join?

150
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,530
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

151
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,120
Small blind, big blind.

152
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm in.

153
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,080
Bet's to you.

154
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,520
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

155
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,360
Two hundred to you.

156
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,500
Bet's to you.

157
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,200
I heard you.

158
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,600
Five to call.

159
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,510
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

160
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,080
Ace high.

161
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,220
Check or bet.

162
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,910
- Check.
- And to you.

163
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,060
Five thousand.

164
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,460
Five to call.

165
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,670
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

166
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,670
All in.

167
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,140
No, wait.

168
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,020
Twenty thousand.

169
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,750
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,350
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

171
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,890
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

172
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,090
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

173
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,040
All right, show me, gentlemen.

174
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,480
Three kings.

175
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,420
There you go with my night.

176
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,020
Trip aces.

177
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,320
Aces win.

178
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,360
Oh, and the valet ticket.

179
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,140
Thank you.

180
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,810
Sir.

181
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

182
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,510
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

183
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,940
My mistake.

184
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,410
Can I give you a lift home?

185
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,450
That would really send him
over the edge.

186
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,590
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

187
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,880
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

188
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,960
Perhaps.

189
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,900
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

190
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Your place?

191
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,070
- Is it close?
- Very.

192
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,350
One drink.

193
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,270
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

194
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,380
Welcome to my home.

195
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,690
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

196
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,560
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

197
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,260
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

198
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,540
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

199
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,310
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

200
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,480
But I do care about my reputation.

201
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,680
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

202
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
He just needs the particulars...

203
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,280
...and payment.

204
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,890
You like married women,
don't you, James?

205
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
It keeps things simple.

206
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,040
What is it about bad men?

207
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,210
You, my husband...

208
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,080
I had so many chances
to be happy...

209
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,650
...so many nice guys.

210
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,550
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

211
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,990
Well, because then they'd be bad.

212
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,190
Yes.

213
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,760
But so much more interesting.

214
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,640
What makes your husband
a bad man?

215
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,400
His nature, I suppose.

216
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,270
The nature of his work?

217
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,140
A mystery, I'm afraid.

218
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:30,120
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

219
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,790
How afraid?

220
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,160
Not enough to stop.

221
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,900
Can I ask you a personal question?

222
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,230
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

223
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,810
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

224
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,120
Should I ask him about it?

225
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,650
Perhaps later.

226
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,790
Yes, dear?

227
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,890
I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.

228
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,720
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

229
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,260
Okay, I understand.

230
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,230
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

231
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,180
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

232
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,540
...so you have all night
to question me.

233
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,850
In that case...

234
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,180
...we're gonna need...

235
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,750
...some more champagne.

236
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,060
Good evening. Room Service.

237
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,060
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

238
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,500
...and the beluga caviar?

239
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,170
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

240
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,460
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

241
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,940
- For two?
- No, for one.

242
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,770
Wait here.

243
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,010
There you go. Number 53.

244
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,360
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

245
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,390
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

246
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,360
...nervous and vascular systems.

247
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,360
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

248
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,260
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

249
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,630
This is edutainment.

250
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,150
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

251
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,230
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

252
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,900
Hello.

253
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,020
Hello.

254
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,190
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

255
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,960
Welcome to Miami
International Airport.

256
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,290
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

257
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,290
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

258
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,230
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

259
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,700
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

260
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,470
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

261
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,610
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

262
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,780
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

263
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,610
I'll call you back.

264
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,750
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

265
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,180
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

266
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,620
Oh, my God!

267
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,420
Bond? Bond!

268
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,530
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

269
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,670
It's launching today.

270
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,870
I gotta go.

271
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,940
Stop! Stop!

272
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,570
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

273
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,470
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

274
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:53,070
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

275
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,780
Someone talked.

276
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,510
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

277
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,770
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

278
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,190
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

279
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,730
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

280
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,560
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

281
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,360
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

282
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,540
No.

283
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,200
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

284
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,840
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

285
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,810
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

286
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,450
...and people who could use them.

287
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,280
He worked with anyone
who had money.

288
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,850
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

289
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,960
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

290
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,620
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

291
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,590
Oh, good. You're here.

292
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,360
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

293
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:27,130
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

294
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,890
So you can keep an eye on me?

295
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,730
Yes.

296
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,770
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9.11...

297
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,280
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

298
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,310
When the stocks hit bottom on 9I12,
somebody made a fortune.

299
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,580
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

300
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,020
...or was supposed to.

301
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,990
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

302
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,220
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

303
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,130
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

304
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,270
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

305
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,170
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

306
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:41,430
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

307
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,410
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

308
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,170
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

309
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,350
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

310
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,820
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

311
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,420
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

312
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,460
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

313
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,030
We can't let him win this game.

314
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,460
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

315
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,500
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

316
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,430
I'm putting you in the game...

317
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,300
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

318
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,070
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

319
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,310
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

320
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,290
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

321
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,650
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

322
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,190
No.

323
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,890
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

324
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,430
We'll know where you are.

325
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,000
You can stop pretending.

326
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,900
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

327
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,370
Well, I knew you were you.

328
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,620
Thank you.

329
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm the money.

330
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,570
Every penny of it.

331
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,100
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

332
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,140
"Vesper."

333
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,840
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

334
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,050
Thank you.

335
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,920
Your boss must be well-connected.

336
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,560
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

337
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,790
Or quite so stylishly.

338
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,330
May I ask you where it is?

339
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,060
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

340
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,600
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

341
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,830
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

342
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,940
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

343
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,710
What looks good?

344
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,760
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

345
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,930
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

346
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,790
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

347
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,230
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

348
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,100
You've heard the term.

349
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,800
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

350
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,370
You play the man across from you.

351
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,940
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

352
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,840
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

353
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,180
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

354
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,750
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

355
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,020
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

356
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,710
So there is a plan?

357
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,490
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

358
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,930
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

359
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,160
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

360
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,530
About you, Miss Lynd?

361
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,330
Well, your beauty's a problem.

362
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

363
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,000
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

364
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,770
True, but this one
overcompensates...

365
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,810
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

366
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,380
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

367
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,050
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

368
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,580
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

369
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,980
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

370
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,960
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

371
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,490
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

372
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,790
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

373
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,660
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

374
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,570
All right.

375
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,000
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

376
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,580
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

377
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,680
But you wear it with such disdain...

378
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,780
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

379
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,550
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

380
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,690
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

381
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,760
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

382
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,450
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

383
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,650
...that's what I'd say you are.

384
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,590
Oh, you are.

385
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,900
I like this poker thing.

386
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,870
And that makes perfect sense...

387
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,480
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

388
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,940
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

389
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,340
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

390
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,640
You know...

391
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,790
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

392
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,660
- Rolex?
- Omega.

393
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,690
Beautiful.

394
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,860
Now, having just met you...

395
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,900
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

396
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,460
No, of course not.

397
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,360
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

398
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,730
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

399
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,030
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

400
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,640
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

401
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,280
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

402
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,450
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

403
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,440
You noticed?

404
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,640
Even accountants have imagination.

405
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,180
How was your lamb?

406
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,150
Skewered.

407
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,980
One sympathizes.

408
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,320
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

409
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,860
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

410
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,350
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

411
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,850
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

412
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,170
It's just last-minute details.

413
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,600
Apparently we're very much in love.

414
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,310
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

415
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,210
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

416
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,580
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

417
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,340
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

418
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,750
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

419
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,920
Oh, no, I don't.

420
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,020
We've been involved
for quite a while...

421
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,380
...hence the shared suite.

422
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,960
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

423
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,890
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

424
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:14,360
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

425
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,060
Religion and a securely locked door.

426
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,240
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

427
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,200
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

428
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,530
Smart?

429
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,840
Single.

430
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,050
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

431
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,130
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

432
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,060
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

433
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,040
You represent the Treasury.

434
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,040
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

435
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,840
I will. Thank you.

436
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,010
Very funny.

437
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,190
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

438
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,290
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

439
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,890
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

440
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,460
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

441
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,960
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

442
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,690
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

443
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,630
And now he knows
something about you.

444
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,030
He knows you're reckless.

445
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,470
Take the next one.

446
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,540
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

447
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,500
Mr. Bond?

448
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,040
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

449
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,700
I love you too, M.

450
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:55,090
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

451
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,150
Does he know
we've been watching him?

452
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,030
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

453
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:07,570
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

454
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,170
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

455
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:14,100
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

456
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,440
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

457
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,410
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

458
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,950
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

459
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,060
That's him, with the mustache.

460
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,820
Over my left shoulder.

461
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,090
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

462
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,260
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

463
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,090
He's not a very subtle man.

464
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,460
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

465
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,870
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

466
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,140
I hate to say it...

467
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:57,310
...but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

468
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,590
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

469
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,060
Many of them are lovely people.

470
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,690
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

471
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,490
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

472
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,040
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

473
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,600
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

474
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,450
Yes?

475
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,780
For you.

476
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,450
Something you expect me to wear?

477
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,260
I need you looking fabulous.

478
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,760
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

479
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,330
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

480
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,260
...and not about their cards.

481
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,870
Do you think you can
do that for me?

482
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,010
I'll do my best.

483
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,010
Thank you.

484
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,250
I have a dinner jacket.

485
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,790
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

486
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,150
This is the latter.

487
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,560
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

488
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,630
How...?

489
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,900
It's tailored.

490
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,660
I sized you up the moment we met.

491
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,990
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

492
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,590
Thank you.

493
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,500
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

494
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,810
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

495
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,810
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

496
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,450
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

497
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,890
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

498
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,690
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

499
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,840
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

500
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,070
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

501
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,500
...holding the stakes.

502
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:10,340
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

503
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,450
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

504
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,740
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

505
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,680
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

506
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,050
...into the encryptor...

507
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,990
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

508
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,320
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

509
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,620
Mr. Bond?

510
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,220
We proceed alphabetically.

511
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,870
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

512
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,440
Six letters or more.

513
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,190
High card for dealer position.

514
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,530
It's Signor Gallardo.

515
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,760
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

516
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:11,430
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

517
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,570
Well, enjoy the game.

518
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,530
Four players.

519
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,470
It's your bet.

520
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,480
Check.

521
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,470
Check.

522
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,840
Bet. Fifty thousand.

523
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:10,330
Call.

524
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,870
Fold.

525
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,470
Fold. Heads up.

526
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:25,210
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

527
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,290
Bet. One hundred thousand.

528
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,390
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

529
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,630
Was I? Forgive me.

530
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,370
Good luck, darling.

531
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:57,580
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

532
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,740
Monsieur Bond?

533
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,610
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

534
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,150
Call.

535
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,450
Hello.

536
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,260
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

537
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,590
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

538
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,770
Champagne.

539
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,340
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

540
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,720
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

541
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,890
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

542
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:53,730
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

543
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,730
Mr. Bond?

544
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,970
Fold.

545
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,680
Send the barman over, please.

546
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,630
A dry martini. Wait.

547
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,530
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

548
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,560
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

549
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,600
- ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

550
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,670
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

551
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,870
Certainly.

552
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,710
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

553
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,910
That's it?

554
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,810
Anyone want to play poker now?

555
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,180
Someone's in a hurry.

556
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,130
Would you excuse me?

557
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,980
You taste nice.

558
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,110
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

559
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,010
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

560
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,740
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

561
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,010
Good.

562
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,990
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

563
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,960
...we won't be here past midnight.

564
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,130
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

565
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,320
Check.

566
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,800
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

567
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,900
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

568
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,000
It was worth it to discover his tell.

569
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,600
What do you mean?

570
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:43,000
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

571
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:47,340
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

572
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,750
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

573
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,920
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

574
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,650
Winning was blind luck.

575
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,690
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

576
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,760
Bet. One hundred thousand.

577
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,480
Thank you.

578
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,730
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

579
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,960
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

580
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,240
Call.

581
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,810
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

582
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

583
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,840
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

584
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:23,510
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

585
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:58,120
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

586
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,590
So?

587
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,920
You want to do what to me?

588
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,460
You've lost me completely.

589
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,600
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

590
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,180
So, what's so damn important?

591
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,220
I'm sorry.

592
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,660
Where is my money?

593
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,400
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

594
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,840
You're holding a parcel for me.

595
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,140
Thank you.

596
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,580
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

597
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,920
Your money is safe.

598
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,450
Open that.

599
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,530
You'll have it tomorrow.

600
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,780
All of it.

601
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,220
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

602
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,500
Hold out your arm.

603
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,570
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

604
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,800
...or I will take your head.

605
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,650
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

606
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,970
Stairs.

607
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,100
Not a word of protest.

608
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,270
You should find a new boyfriend.

609
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,130
Go find Mathis.

610
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,570
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

611
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,800
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

612
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,230
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

613
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:57,270
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

614
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,710
A little.

615
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:02,480
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

616
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:06,710
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

617
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:12,320
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

618
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,220
Here, let's see.

619
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:32,640
That's better.

620
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,040
You cold?

621
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,650
Yeah.

622
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,750
Here.

623
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,740
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

624
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,240
Less than some.

625
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:00,760
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

626
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,390
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

627
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,830
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

628
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:10,700
How's our girl?

629
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,440
Melted your cold heart yet?

630
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,560
Call.

631
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,160
Fold.

632
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,330
And call.

633
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:40,690
Three players.

634
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,070
Three hundred grand.

635
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,940
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

636
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:51,470
Call.

637
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,180
And call.

638
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,650
Three players.

639
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,980
Check.

640
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,660
Monsieur Bond?

641
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,980
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

642
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:40,960
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

643
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,190
My God, James was right.

644
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,230
It's up to you.

645
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,770
Raise. One million.

646
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,220
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

647
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,450
Fold.

648
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,420
Heads up, gentlemen.

649
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,180
It's up to you.

650
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,840
Two.

651
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:28,700
Re-raise. Two million.

652
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,740
And it's up to you.

653
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,690
I'm all in.

654
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,470
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

655
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:58,000
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

656
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,010
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

657
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,680
- Call.
- Call.

658
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,480
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

659
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,620
Full house. Kings and aces.

660
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,850
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

661
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:34,500
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

662
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:41,680
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

663
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,510
Please.

664
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,020
We will now break for one hour.

665
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,550
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

666
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,660
Good game.

667
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,130
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

668
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,030
I can't do that, James.

669
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:35,970
Look, I made a mistake.

670
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,760
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

671
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,410
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

672
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,910
Sorry?

673
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,880
Try putting that in a sentence.

674
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,480
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

675
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,010
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

676
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:53,280
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

677
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,890
That's what this is about.

678
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,060
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

679
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,850
Then you're an idiot.

680
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,930
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

681
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:06,100
Look in my eyes.

682
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,630
I can beat this man, you know that.

683
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,870
Get your hand off my arm.

684
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:37,930
Vodka martini.

685
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,930
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

686
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,390
- James.
- Get the girl out.

687
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,630
Funny game, right?

688
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:12,930
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

689
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:16,760
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

690
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,170
You should have a little faith.

691
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,870
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

692
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,340
Had. Excuse me.

693
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,710
You're not buying in?

694
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,780
No.

695
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,060
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

696
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,920
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

697
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,090
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

698
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:49,170
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

699
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,870
And what about the winnings?

700
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,140
Does it look like
we need the money?

701
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,780
Shall we up the blinds?

702
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,690
Why not?

703
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,660
Bet.

704
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,400
Raise.

705
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,850
And fold.

706
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,060
Excuse me, please.

707
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,390
Call.

708
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,090
Raise.

709
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,760
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

710
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:58,210
- Fold.
- Thank you.

711
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,740
Fold.

712
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:07,540
Fold.

713
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:13,890
Thank you.

714
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,060
Wins.

715
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,340
Deal me out.

716
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,470
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

717
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,010
Small blind, please.

718
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,520
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

719
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,750
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

720
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,360
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

721
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,190
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

722
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,660
I'm all ears.

723
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:06,390
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

724
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,930
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

725
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:17,310
Attach the leads to your chest.

726
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,920
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

727
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,020
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

728
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:32,850
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

729
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,790
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

730
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,470
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

731
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:40,100
His heart's gonna stop.

732
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,670
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

733
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:47,540
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

734
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:50,040
That'll counteract the digitalis.

735
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,150
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

736
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,780
You need to keep
your heart going.

737
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,210
Push the red button now, Bond.

738
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,760
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

739
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,610
- You okay?
- Me?

740
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:02,540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:06,410
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

742
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,820
As soon as I've won this game.

743
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,750
You're not seriously
going back there?

744
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:16,230
I wouldn't dream of it.

745
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,460
Bet. One million.

746
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,760
- All in.
- Call. All in.

747
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:27,570
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

748
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,480
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

749
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:37,850
Queen plays. Wins.

750
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:50,390
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

752
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:55,430
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

753
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,400
...which means no more buy-ins.

754
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:00,800
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

755
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,010
Four players.

756
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,180
It's your bet.

757
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,390
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

758
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:22,430
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

759
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,430
Check. And check.

760
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,460
All check.

761
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,000
Four players.

762
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:37,410
- Check.
- Check.

763
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,480
All in. Six million.

764
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,910
Bet. Six million. All in.

765
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,690
Five million. All in.

766
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,460
Bet is 6 million.

767
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,310
Raise.

768
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,070
Raise.

769
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,540
Twelve million. Heads up.

770
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:48,270
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

771
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,550
Raise. All in.

772
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,030
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

773
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,080
Call.

774
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,160
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

775
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:42,100
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

776
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,670
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

777
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,240
Full house. Eights full of aces.

778
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:19,530
A higher full house.

779
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,210
Aces full of sixes.

780
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,410
Monsieur Bond.

781
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:47,960
Five and seven of spades.

782
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:49,640
A straight flush.

783
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,130
Four to the eight.

784
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,430
The high hand.

785
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:59,670
Monsieur Bond wins.

786
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,980
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

787
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:06,610
Congratulations.

788
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:10,350
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

789
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,490
Congratulations.

790
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,560
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

791
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:23,290
You were almost dead an hour ago.

792
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:27,160
Come on, I'm famished.

793
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:39,450
Thank you.

794
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:50,960
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

795
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,790
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

796
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,470
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

797
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:59,670
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

798
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:04,040
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

799
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,740
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

800
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:12,480
But you're laughing at it.

801
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:17,090
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

802
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,960
I figured out what that is.

803
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,670
It's an Algerian love knot.

804
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:33,070
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

805
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,900
No, you didn't.

806
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,280
Someone gave that to you.

807
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,710
He's a very lucky man.

808
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:52,060
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

809
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:54,620
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

810
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:58,260
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

811
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,430
I don't believe you.

812
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:04,230
You've got a choice, you know?

813
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,030
Just because
you've done something...

814
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,370
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

815
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,480
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

816
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,650
You think I can't take
my own advice?

817
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:17,210
I think something is driving you.

818
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,780
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

819
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,850
Mathis needs me.

820
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,790
Good night.

821
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,330
Congratulations again.

822
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,450
Mathis.

823
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:48,330
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

824
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,400
...my friend Mathis.

825
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:36,710
You've taken good care
of your body.

826
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,740
Such a waste.

827
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,900
You know...

828
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:54,390
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

829
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,800
It's the simplest thing...

830
01:49:57,010 --> 01:50:00,530
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

831
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,200
And of course...

832
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:06,380
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

833
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:09,240
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

834
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:13,580
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

835
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,560
The only question remains...

836
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:25,230
...will you yield in time?

837
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:30,430
I want the money.

838
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:52,590
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

839
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:55,160
So all I need from you
is the password.

840
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:08,170
The password, please.

841
01:51:12,410 --> 01:51:14,710
I've got a little itch...

842
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,780
...down there.

843
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:19,020
Would you mind?

844
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:30,160
No! No! No!

845
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:34,830
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

846
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,470
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

847
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:40,900
Yeah!

848
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:45,440
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:56,560
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

850
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,850
I died?

851
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,360
- I died?
- Yes.

852
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,530
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

853
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:06,560
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

854
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:09,600
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

855
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,200
Because if you kill me...

856
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:13,470
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

857
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,470
But you are so wrong!

858
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:19,670
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

859
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:22,680
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

860
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,850
...because they need what I know.

861
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:31,150
The big picture.

862
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:41,300
Give me the password...

863
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,440
...and I will at least let her live.

864
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:50,200
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

865
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:05,420
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

866
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:07,420
No.

867
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,160
So I think...

868
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:19,140
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

869
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:34,550
I'll get the money.

870
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:37,950
Tell them I'll get the money.

871
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:42,620
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

872
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,650
Francesco.

873
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:10,490
Francesco.

874
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,330
Vesper.

875
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:29,110
Vesper.

876
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,770
No.

877
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,910
Not him.

878
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,020
Not Mathis.

879
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:40,010
No.

880
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:42,880
I'll get the doctor.

881
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:47,460
Not him.

882
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,520
Any ideas?

883
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:58,100
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

884
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:01,540
Where is she?

885
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,480
Sleeping.

886
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:08,340
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

887
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:11,110
It's just odd...

888
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,220
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

889
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:18,760
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

890
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:22,050
Get a look at the killer?

891
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,330
No.

892
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,230
Shame.

893
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,630
Drink up.

894
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,200
Anything else you remember?

895
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:38,440
Anything that can help us?

896
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:40,270
Help us?

897
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,710
Or help you?

898
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:24,250
Hello.

899
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,290
Hello.

900
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,290
You all right?

901
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:32,090
I can't resist waking you.

902
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:36,930
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

903
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:40,060
It makes me feel reborn.

904
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:46,910
If you'd just been born...

905
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,850
...wouldn't you be naked?

906
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:52,810
You have me there.

907
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:58,190
You can have me anywhere.

908
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:01,790
I can?

909
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,860
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

910
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:09,770
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

911
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:12,170
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

912
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:13,810
It's just that not so long ago...

913
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:17,880
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

914
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:21,980
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

915
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:25,450
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

916
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:28,480
That is something to be afraid of.

917
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,890
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

918
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:39,060
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

919
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:41,260
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

920
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:43,460
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

921
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:46,500
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

922
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:48,830
I'm afraid not.

923
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,910
If you would type in
the account number.

924
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,390
And now the password.

925
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:03,350
You can do that.

926
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:06,120
I would if I knew what it was.

927
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:08,730
V-E-S-P-E-R.

928
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:25,740
The funds have been transferred.

929
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:28,810
Sorry for disturbing you.

930
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:33,880
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

931
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:41,860
You know, James...

932
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:47,370
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

933
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:50,870
...was your smile
and your little finger...

934
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:53,800
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

935
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:06,880
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

936
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:13,630
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

937
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:20,830
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

938
01:59:21,570 --> 01:59:23,700
You've got your armor back on.

939
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:25,130
That's that.

940
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:29,200
I have no armor left.

941
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:32,940
You've stripped it from me.

942
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:36,280
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:39,620
Whatever is left of me...

944
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,420
...whatever I am...

945
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:45,110
...I'm yours.

946
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:49,550
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

947
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:52,120
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

948
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:53,520
Mathis?

949
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:55,750
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

950
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:58,400
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

951
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,520
That's how he wiped me out.

952
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:04,400
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

953
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,800
I can't believe it.

954
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:08,600
No, neither could I.

955
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,480
I thought he had my back.

956
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:13,940
But there you go, lesson learned.

957
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:17,750
Does everyone have a tell?

958
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,420
Yes.

959
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,120
Everyone.

960
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:28,360
Everyone except you.

961
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:34,860
I wonder if that's why I love you.

962
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,840
You love me?

963
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:41,640
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

964
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,040
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

965
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:48,740
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

966
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:51,080
You're serious.

967
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:53,950
Like you said...

968
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,220
...you do what I do for too long...

969
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:59,220
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

970
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:02,290
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

971
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:06,390
Is that enough for you?

972
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:52,640
- Come on.
- No. No.

973
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:56,340
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

974
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:58,740
What's the time?

975
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:03,040
How much do we need
to float for a month?

976
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,280
I've got plenty.

977
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:09,420
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

978
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,690
You stopped wearing the necklace.

979
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:18,060
Yeah. It was time.

980
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:21,000
Time enough to get over someone?

981
02:04:25,770 --> 02:04:29,140
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

982
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:39,750
Though apparently not
your employer.

983
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:47,420
Back in one month.

984
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,900
Come on. I'll get the money...

985
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:53,260
...you get supplies.

986
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:25,360
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

987
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:52,290
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

988
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:54,150
Yes?

989
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:56,190
We'll talk about that later.

990
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,390
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

991
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:02,160
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

992
02:06:05,870 --> 02:06:08,710
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

993
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:12,210
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

994
02:06:12,410 --> 02:06:14,570
So you'll be depositing it today.

995
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:17,540
On my way to the bank right now.

996
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:20,650
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

997
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,280
Hello.

998
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:25,890
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

999
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:27,920
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:30,430
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:33,070 --> 02:06:36,470
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:39,170 --> 02:06:41,000
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,440
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:46,510
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:00,370
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:02,580
Allow me.

1007
02:13:22,510 --> 02:13:24,480
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:36,140 --> 02:16:38,870
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:16:39,070 --> 02:16:41,130
They were very much in love.

1010
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:44,670
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:49,840
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:51,420
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:53,850
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:16:54,050 --> 02:16:55,580
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:16:57,220 --> 02:16:59,090
How are you doing?

1016
02:16:59,430 --> 02:17:01,660
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:04,230
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:07,190
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:10,500
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1020
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:12,330
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:15,030
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,570
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:20,140
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1024
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:21,970
No.

1025
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:24,750
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:25,550 --> 02:17:27,750
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:29,650
Will do.

1028
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:33,290
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:33,490 --> 02:17:34,760
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:39,160
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:41,900
James...

1032
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:45,940
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:48,230
Isn't it obvious?

1034
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:52,400
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:54,770
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:59,340
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:00,450 --> 02:18:03,390
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:06,150
The trail's gone cold.

1039
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:35,580
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1040
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:37,270
We need to talk.

1041
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:39,350
Who is this?

1042
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:11,640
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:13,790
James Bond.

1044
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:45,840
