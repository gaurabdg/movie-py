That's why I'm here.

caused that bus to go off the road.

Dolores?

479
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:37,755
It's my belief that Dolores was doing
exactly what she's done for years.

480
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:41,126
Besides, the school board's insurance
on Dolores was minimal:

481
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,129
A few million at most.

482
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,590
No, the really deep pockets
are in the town.

483
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,134
Or the company that made the bus.

484
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:52,137
So you think someone else
caused the accident, Μr. Stevens?

485
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:56,938
Μrs. Otto, there is no such thing
as an accident.

486
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,729
The word doesn't mean anything to me.

487
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,565
As far as I'm concerned,

488
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,318
somebody, somewhere...

489
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,112
made a decision to cut a corner.

490
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:13,197
Some corrupt agency or corporation

491
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:17,287
accounted the cost variance
between a 10-cent bolt

492
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,027
and a million-dollar
out-of-court settlement.

493
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:28,632
And they decided to sacrifice
a few lives for the difference.

494
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,134
That's what's done, Μrs. Otto.

495
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,388

so many times before.

497
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:38,141
she hit a patch of ice,

498
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,519
and lost control of the bus.

499
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,522
Yeah... Μr. Otto, how long has Dolores
been driving that bus?

500
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:46,149
How many times
has she steered clear of danger?

501

to believe, Μr. Stevens?

510

That you know what's best for us?

in her windpipe,

So stay out of it.

01:27:54,127 --> 01:27:56,086
Well, I've tried to stay out of it, Sam.

1258

Turns out that's not so easy.

I mean, lots of folks got lawyers.

But he's the one
who's gonna subpoena me, Sam.

1263
01:28:07,807 --> 01:28:10,168
He's gonna force me to testify in court.

1264
01:28:11,644 --> 01:28:13,808
He came by the garage this afternoon.

1265
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:19,443
- Gave me that slip of paper.
- Why would he do that?

1266
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:22,654
I mean, you didn't have anything to do
with the accident.

1267
01:28:22,655 --> 01:28:24,918
Because I was driving behind the bus.

does subpoena me,

if he forces me to go over
all this again,

1271

are gonna line up behind him

Oh, I will offer that report.

1412
01:37:50,806 --> 01:37:52,807
Well, then.

1413
01:37:52,808 --> 01:37:55,135
Now that your memory
seems to be clearing,

1414
01:37:55,686 --> 01:37:58,579
can you tell us what else you observed
at that time?

1415
01:37:59,231 --> 01:38:02,528
"NICOLE: <i>" It's dull in our town
since my playmates left.</i>

1416
01:38:02,818 --> 01:38:05,179

1417
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:08,784

MAN: Nicole?

1420
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:18,418
I was scared.

1421
01:38:19,251 --> 01:38:20,776
Why were you scared?

1422
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:23,891
This is before the accident, Nicole.

1423
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:26,944
You understand what I'm asking?

1424
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,720
Yes, I understand.

1425
01:38:30,846 --> 01:38:32,518
Why were you scared?

1426
01:38:36,393 --> 01:38:39,542
Dolores was driving too fast.

1427
01:38:40,856 --> 01:38:42,857
Μrs. Driscoll
was driving too fast?

1428
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,731
What made you think that, Nicole?

1429
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,631
The speedometer.

1430
01:38:47,446 --> 01:38:50,490
- It... it was downhill there.
- You could see

1431
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,360
the speedometer?

1432
01:38:52,576 --> 01:38:54,248
Yes.

1433
01:38:55,538 --> 01:38:59,523
I looked.
I... I remember clearly now.

1434
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:03,419
Seemed we were going too fast
down the hill and I was scared.

1435
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:05,421
How fast would you say
Μrs. Driscoll was going?

1436
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,465
To the best of your recollection.

1437
01:39:07,466 --> 01:39:09,729
72 miles an hour.

1438
01:39:14,306 --> 01:39:16,175
72 miles an hour?

1439
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:18,012
You're sure of this?

1440
01:39:18,477 --> 01:39:20,199
Positive.

1441
01:39:21,856 --> 01:39:24,315
So you believe the bus
driven by Μrs. Driscoll

1442
01:39:24,316 --> 01:39:27,366
was traveling at 72 miles an hour
at this time?

1443
01:39:29,905 --> 01:39:31,774
I told you I was positive.

1444
01:39:32,908 --> 01:39:35,910
The speedometer was large
and easy to read from where I was.

1445
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:37,287
You saw the speedometer?

1446
01:39:37,288 --> 01:39:39,206
Yes.

1447
01:39:40,124 --> 01:39:42,583
Did you say anything
to Μrs. Driscoll?

1448
01:39:43,752 --> 01:39:45,128
No.

1449
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:48,425
- Why not?
- Because I was scared.

1450
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:50,983
And there wasn't time.

1451
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,991
There wasn't time?

1452
01:39:55,931 --> 01:39:57,603
No.

1453
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:01,924
Because the bus went off the road
and crashed.

1454
01:40:02,354 --> 01:40:03,731
You remember this?

1455
01:40:07,943 --> 01:40:09,714
Yes.

1456
01:40:11,447 --> 01:40:13,562
I do now.

1457
01:40:15,951 --> 01:40:17,820
Now that I'm telling it.

1458
01:40:32,968 --> 01:40:35,821
Do you have any questions,
Μr. Stevens?

Thanks.

what she was doing in there. She's, uh...

1474
01:42:04,143 --> 01:42:06,352
She was... she was lying.

1475
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:08,771
But it doesn't matter
whether she was lying or not.

1476
01:42:08,772 --> 01:42:10,982
The lawsuit is dead!

Everyone's lawsuit is dead!
Forget it!

1478
01:42:14,445 --> 01:42:15,778
Tell the others to forget it.

1479
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:17,698
It is over.

1480
01:42:18,073 --> 01:42:20,283
Right now, Sam,
the thing you've got to worry about

1481
01:42:20,284 --> 01:42:21,907
is why she lied.

1482
01:42:22,494 --> 01:42:27,294
Now, any kid who would do that to a father
is not normal, Sam.
