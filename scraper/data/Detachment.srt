1
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,506
Let's, uhm... Let's not have
people come in.

2
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,356
I'd like to do this without
anybody in here.

3
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,408
Could everybody split, that
doesn't have to be here. Thanks.

4
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,468
- Maybe we can keep...
- And close the door.

5
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:36,138
- Keep people away from the door.
- Is that good?

6
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,699
Yep. Thank you

7
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:56,244
"And never have I felt so
deeply at one and the same time

8
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,216
so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

(Albert Camus)
French philosopher and writer

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,744
"For Henry"

11
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,615
I wasn't good in school.
I didn't care for school.

12
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,756
Uhm ... It was nice socially,
my own experience, but

13
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,087
I kinda just went along...

14
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,158
I started off as a music major.

15
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,599
I was gonna be
a Rock 'n' Roll star.

16
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,198
But that didn't quite
work out.

17
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,180
In 1985,

18
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,390
during a hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

19
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,131
I was walk... I was taking
a train into the city to work.

20
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,182
I'd gotten to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law,

21
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:07,383
who had just
started teaching,

22
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,464
and he said that he was
off from school.

23
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:10,885
Now, now,
wait a second,

24
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,685
You're off from school
for hurricane

25
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:15,696
and I'm goin' into the city
to work in an Office building?

26
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,787
I said: "Whoa, that's a
pretty good gig, right."

27
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:24,258
My mom was a teacher and I knew
without a shadow of a doubt

28
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,288
from early childhood that
the one job I would never do

29
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,269
was become a teacher.

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,970
Never ever I would take
toll cards on a turnpike.

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,902
I'd be a shepard, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

32
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,603
I decided to become a teacher
because I wanted to do

33
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,544
something with my life besides
what I was doing

34
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,293
which was driving a truck,
for a company and,

35
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:48,095
I decided I wanted to do
a little bit better for myself

36
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,545
so I got into teaching
a little bit.

37
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:53,195
I went back to school
at the age of 37.

38
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,267
A friend of mine from college...

39
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:57,217
His aunt was the...

40
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,518
Principal of an all-girls
inner city school

41
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,049
in Newark, New Jersey, and
they were desperate for teachers

42
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,050
So, I thought "Great,
I can do this for a year,

43
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,400
it'll keep my father from making
me get a job at Prudential,

44
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,541
and then I'll figure out
what I wanna do."

45
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,704
Well, they called me up
asking me to go to an interview,

46
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:21,043
and I happened to get an job

47
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,164
in a Junior High school,
in Queens,

48
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,645
and I ended up...

49
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:29,917
starting it at my...
What's now?... my 30th year.

50
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:37,008
Most of the teachers here,
at one point...

51
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,719
...they believed...,

52
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,161
that they could
make a difference

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,961
You know, I know
how important it is to

54
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:52,212
have guidance and to have

55
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:59,254
someone help understand
the complexities

56
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:00,995
of the world
that we live in.

57
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:05,886
I didn't really have that
growing up.

58
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:27,072
Producers:

59
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:34,424
Written by:

60
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:39,265
Directed by:

61
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,437
I am money.

62
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,037
I change hands
like a dollar bill

63
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:51,068
that's been robbed
by a lamp

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,159
when a genie appeared
and cried loudly, with volume.

65
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,719
But the tears were
all for myself.

66
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,731
And that's where it
all went wrong.

67
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,370
Uh hi, Lupe, Dean Vargas here.

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,921
uh I'm sick and uh..won't be
coming in today, allright?

69
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,164
Get to the point, Dr. Hart.
I've got a school to run.

70
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,805
Your State scores have gone
down in the last three years.

71
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,735
- You're not delivering... - Don't pretend
like you don't know the game.

72
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:52,946
You earmarked my school
as a transfer dump

73
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,456
for the worst kids in
the district.

74
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,747
Well, kids deserve an education,
don't you agree?

75
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,087
I agree you're jerking of
and wasting my time.

76
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,968
- Get to the point, Dr. Hart...
- We need consensus builders.

77
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,199
- New methodology.
- You're corporatizing the system.

78
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,000
No, we're cleaning house.

79
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,250
The superintendent feels that
it's time your stepped down.

80
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,651
Babe, you got some fuckin'
nerve coming into my yard

81
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,252
with the hard fuckin' sell.

82
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:19,753
Carol, there was a time
when you were an educator.

83
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,053
You were very well respected.

84
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:26,955
Why don't you go
out on top?

85
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,438
Oi!

86
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,858
Everybody sit down
and shut up,

87
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,920
or I start pulling out
the referrals.

88
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,020
Sit!

89
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,551
Sit down!

90
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,282
I am starting the DVD.

91
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,092
I am starting the DVD.

92
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,429
- Barth or Barthes
- Barth. Mr. Barth.

93
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:22,344
Mr. Henry Barthes

94
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,761
So you've taken long term
assignments at ah..

95
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,042
"Lock and McArthur"?

96
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,392
"The Fringe."

97
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:31,823
Well, that's... that's...where the work's at.

98
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,524
This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

99
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:38,675
I asked to meet with you
because you come

100
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:42,876
highly recommended as the
best sub on the call sheet.

101
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:46,476
Hmmph....that's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

102
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,678
I agree, Mr. Barth.

103
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,168
You'll find many of your
students functioning

104
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:56,180
well below grade level.

105
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,229
Teach the Curriculum,
most importantly.

106
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,930
Understood?

107
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,688
- Good morning
- Good morning

108
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,166
I'm Mr. Barthes.

109
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:21,407
Those of you who haven't
heard, this is English 11 A.

110
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:22,460
- Yes
- Yeah

111
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,287
Listen up, I have one rule.

112
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,001
Just one.

113
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:29,089
If you don't wish to be here

114
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:30,738
don't come.

115
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,589
Dude, what does that mean?

116
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:35,181
It's not dude, it's Mr. Barthes.

117
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,800
The S is silent.

118
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,001
- You're fuckin' gay.
- Marcus, shut up!

119
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,842
No, you shut up!

120
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,022
You dyke Bitch!

121
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:47,773
Hey, Marcus.

122
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,674
Guess what.

123
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:50,895
What?

124
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,045
You're free to leave.

125
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,146
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

126
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:57,097
- Aight yo..
- Catch you later, man.

127
00:08:57,146 --> 00:09:00,107
- What the fuck? You want me
to go to the Dean's Office?

128
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,347
- I don't care where you go.

129
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,059
Everyone pull out
a sheet of paper.

130
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,319
I'd like to assess what your
individual writing skills are.

131
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:08,099
What if we aint got no paper?

132
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay here is the situation.
You're dead.

133
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:13,750
- Alright, write an brief
but detailed essay about...

134
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,202
- Hey jackass! I asked you
a fucking question!

135
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:19,252
...about what a friend
or a parent

136
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:22,313
might say about you
during your funeral. OK?

137
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,485
- You have 30 minutes.
- Oh, shit...

138
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,936
I asked you a motherfuckin'
question, didn't I?

139
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,244
Anything else?

140
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:45,490
You'd better back the fuck up
before I fuckin' rock ya shit.

141
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,821
That bag,

142
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:53,742
It doesn't have any feelings.
It's empty.

143
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:56,813
I don't have any feelings
you can hurt either. OK?

144
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,803
I understand you're angry.

145
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:03,564
I used to be very
angry too, OK. I get it.

146
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:06,065
You have no reason to be
angry with me, because

147
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:09,466
I am one of the few people that's
here trying to give you an opportunity.

148
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:11,086
Now I am going to ask you,

149
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:14,818
to just sit down,
and do your best,

150
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:18,819
and I'll give you a piece
of paper. How's that?

151
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,911
Can I get a fuckin' pen too?

152
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:31,412
Kids don't have any
attention span. They're bored.

153
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:35,324
So how are you supposed to
reel them in with classic literature

154
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:42,666
if they don't...if they don't believe
that you

155
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,346
have something meaningful
to share.

156
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:53,648
Thank you.

157
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:59,730
Why'd you throw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

158
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,331
Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

159
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,681
Anyway, Marcus verbally
assaulted you,

160
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,532
that's not allowed
in my classroom.

161
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,493
And, what they say to me
is immaterial.

162
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:12,354
What's your name?

163
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,474
Meredith.

164
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:16,464
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

165
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,335
So you really don't care
what the kids say to you?

166
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,567
Perhaps I've gotten
used to it.

167
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,236
I wish I could be
that strong.

168
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:27,538
It doesn't take strength,
Meredith. You gotta...

169
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:32,339
understand that unfortunately
most people lack self-awareness.

170
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,140
You should really keep that
in mind as you head into

171
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,110
the trenches of
second period.

172
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,191
You'll meet them again
at every age.

173
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,563
- I want to see the Principal.
- That's her, mom.

174
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,644
You the bitch that expelled
my baby? --excuse me.  -And for what?

175
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:51,245
- Excuse me, maybe you'd like...
- Because you can't handle it?

176
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,775
And bitch, why are you here?

177
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:57,775
You wanna be at home with her everyday.
I don't have time for this bullshit!Do you understand me?

178
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:57,906
- Keep your voice down!
- Why are you here?

179
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:00,346
Hey maam, clam down.
We'll go talk about this

180
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:03,198
in the Dean's Office.
- I ain't goin' nowhere with you.

181
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,848
Look, miss, I know
you're angry

182
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,448
but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

183
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:10,540
- Racist bitch, I'ma sue
your ass. - Ok,Come on, ladies.

184
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:11,693
This way

185
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,351
- Ladies
- What happened?

186
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,601
Bitch, you gimme
any mo' shit in class

187
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:20,852
an I'm gon have my niggas

fuckin' gang rape your ass!

188
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:39,197
- Excuse me. Are you
new here? - It's, ah first day.

189
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:41,608
Welcome. That was quite
a scene back there.

190
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:46,840
I was a little stunned.
But it's actually safe here.

191
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:50,410
- Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.
- I am Henry, Henry Barthes.

192
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:15,948
Whatever is on my mind,
I say it as I feel it.

193
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,588
I'm truthful to myself.

194
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:21,059
I'm young,
and I'm old.

195
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:23,630
I've been bought
and I've been sold,

196
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,070
so many times.

197
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:32,402
I am hard face.
I am gone.

198
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,753
I am just like you.

199
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:37,063
Patricia!

200
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:44,545
Patricia!

201
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,960
- Hello? - Henry, it's Rita,
from the hospital.

202
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,772
He's done it again, you
need to get down here.

203
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:09,962
Bastards, leave me alone!

204
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,183
Then why aren't you
handling this?

205
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,464
I can't get him out!

206
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:16,035
- You come and get him.
- Patricia.

207
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,375
Thanks.

208
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:25,237
Grandpa, come on.
It's Henry, open the door.

209
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:26,866
Patricia!

210
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:28,868
No, it's Henry. It's Henry.

211
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:30,969
- Who?
- It's Henry.

212
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:35,490
Grandpa, please, open...
Open the door.

213
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,491
Hi, sweetheart.

214
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,562
I thought you were
your mom.

215
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,193
You're dressed okay, there...

216
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,993
Were you going somewhere?

217
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,993
No I'm goin' to work.

218
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:53,264
You're retired, OK?

219
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:57,656
It's very, very late so I need
you to go to sleep, OK?

220
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,297
Lets come to bed.

221
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:05,307
How're you doin', huh?

222
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,001
Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

223
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,851
Huh eh. Isn't that silly?

224
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:37,965
Fuck.

225
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,309
- Everything okay?
- You shut up!

226
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:44,378
You listen

227
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,410
I know you're just some
under-educated drone

228
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,210
passing the time with
these old dying people

229
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,911
But I'm paying for his assisted
living, and you're not assisting him.

230
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:57,611
I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

231
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,033
You know how he gets
at night, he forgets?

232
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:03,613
So you need to be there for
him, to make him feel safe.

233
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,214
Let me be very clear here!

234
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:10,815
You stop neglecting his needs
or I will start fucking with yours!

235
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,716
I will have you fired!

236
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:15,467
Then it's gonna
be your family!

237
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:17,017
Your children,

238
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,418
are gonna be at risk!

239
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,970
You got it?!

240
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,363
I got it.

241
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,919
Don't you ever make me come
down here again at this hour, OK?

242
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,084
Gimme the fuckin' money!

243
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,335
You heard me!
Gimme the fuckin' money!

244
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:24,055
Give me the fucking
money now!

245
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,237
You think I like you?
Give me the fucking money!

246
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:28,287
- You want money?
- Now!

247
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,849
Why are you following me?

248
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,211
I am not. It's late, you should
be home, it's a school night.

249
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,442
What? You crazy man?

250
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,512
- What the fuck is your deal, huh?
- Get away from me.

251
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:23,452
Why did you let that guy
beat the shit out of me?

252
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,754
- Huh? You just sat there, like you
were a fuckin lemon or something.

253
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:27,854
Excuse me, I don't wanna
talk to you.

254
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:28,823
You think there's something
wrong with that?

255
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,754
Listen, little kid.

256
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,924
I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong,

257
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,595
but this isn't
the fucking answer, OK?

258
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:35,706
Go figure it out,

259
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,456
'cause you're gonne get
really old really quick.

260
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:38,957
Know that! - Why are you
so mean to me, huh?

261
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,477
You don't think I have feelings?

262
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:43,058
Do you?
Do you have feelings?

263
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:44,077
Listen, pal!

264
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,668
I mean, between you and me

265
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,560
you look like you've got
more problems than me.

266
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,459
- Oh really?
- Yeah, really!

267
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,960
- So come on, I'll make it  better.
- What are you doing? Get off, please.

268
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,060
- Are you flirting with me?
- Nothing,

269
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,882
I'm just offering to hang out,
if you know what I mean.

270
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,812
- I don't wanna hang out with you.
- I don't know. You seem kinda lonely.

271
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:00,952
Maybe we go back
to your place and just ..relax.

272
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,464
Afraid you'll like it?

273
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:06,765
I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

274
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,654
so many times
you've gotten used to it.

275
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,225
Fuck you, man!

276
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,216
Fuck off, queer.

277
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:16,007
Have a good night, yeah.

278
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,958
Yeah, yeah!
Just walk away? Hey?

279
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,997
Where are you going?

280
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,453
"He just fucks
their shit up, and..."

281
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:42,063
"The ladies cry for me ..."

282
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:43,992
"At the funeral"

283
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:46,575
"'cause I aint around no more,"

284
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,115
"to dicks that split up ..."

285
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:51,399
"Raw and shit ..."

286
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,457
"And ma boys all gets faded ..."

287
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:58,488
"blazin' that skunk shit and fuck."

288
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:00,579
Toni V.

289
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,701
You know it's funny
I spend a lot of time

290
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:11,782
trying to not have to deal,
to not really commit.

291
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,863
I'm a substitute teacher.

292
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,504
There's no real
responsibility to teach.

293
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,384
The responsibility is
to maintain order,

294
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:22,385
make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

295
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,845
and then they get
to their next period.

296
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,846
"She used to be a sweet girl"

297
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,937
"She never seemed
dissatisfied with her life."

298
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,498
"And why should she have been?"

299
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,298
"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed ... "

300
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,989
"So why did she
become so angry?"

301
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:39,219
"So miserable and mean
all of a sudden"

302
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:40,442
"We don't know."

303
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,701
"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

304
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,981
"We were good parents"

305
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:48,541
"But still, she repaid us
for all we've done"

306
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,593
"by killing herself"

307
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:53,593
"Stupid selfish Child"

308
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:57,845
"Now she'll never
get into Princeton"

309
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,925
No name.

310
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,676
"Uh hi Lupe, Dean Vargas again"

311
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:09,059
"I can't do it anymore"

312
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,090
" I ...um I quit! "

313
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:21,772
Well, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker.

314
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,002
Would you like a happy pill
help you through the day?

315
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:25,992
They're yummy.

316
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:31,054
I need you to fill in for Dean
Vargas second period.

317
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,704
I'm worried about you, Charlie.

318
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:41,007
I just, uh... really love
watchin' you leave the room.

319
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:47,068
Mr. Seaboldt. He maintained
a sense of humor.

320
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:53,469
I think a sense of humor
is key. I don't posses it.

321
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,255
I mean, I do ...

322
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,161
in a tragic sort of way.

323
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,012
Whatcha doin' here, Mr. Sea?

324
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:02,062
Uhm, filling in for
Dean Vargas.

325
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,963
Vargas is a bitch.

326
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:07,013
Talk shit, and you get
slapped like a bitch.

327
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,064
You're not gonna give me
no detention neither.

328
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,065
Or I'm gonna arm-fuck your shit
up tight, ..motherfucker!

329
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:16,517
Um-shit... No, arm-fuck
your shit up tight, motherfucker.

330
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:20,217
Wow! That is,..
I mean, really poetic.

331
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,618
I mean, that's truly...
What, lyrical.

332
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:24,278
You should take that
on the stage.

333
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:25,839
I mean that shit sells itself.

334
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,467
Hmm, I, who's protuberance walks a quarter of a mile before he say's:

335
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,592
I'm going to arm-fuck your
shit up tight, motherfucker. HaHmm.

336
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:38,262
I'll tell you what I'll do, laddy.

337
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:39,983
I'll arm-fuck your shit up tight.

338
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:44,524
I'll arm-fuck it right uptight
up your ass, you motherfucker.

339
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:53,176
♪♪♪I'm going to arm-fuck your
shit up tight, you motherfucker.♪♪♪

340
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,792
I'll tell what, um...

341
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,527
Why don't you have a seat,
OK? And then I'll...

342
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,228
I'll back shortly and we'll
discuss your bright future.

343
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,805
Okay, my man?

344
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,699
I mean, my motherfucker.

345
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,040
Okay, Mae West?

346
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,368
Ellen, can I see your nipples?

347
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,246
What? No!

348
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,154
Wrong.

349
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:19,814
See I... Actually I can.

350
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:22,705
See, that's the whole point,
you have to wear a bra to school.

351
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,685
Look Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

352
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:27,685
I don't tell you how to dress,
so you don't tell me.

353
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:28,846
Capiche?

354
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,539
Ellen, do you know
what that is?

355
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:41,660
It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

356
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,750
It's rather pretty, isn't it?

357
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,451
Now, Ellen.

358
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,272
Do you know what that is?

359
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:50,742
That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

360
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,253
That's fucking grose.

361
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:54,483
Yes very. So, you see,

362
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,245
when you come to school
dressed like that, you give

363
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,045
you give out the wrong signal.

364
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,745
Don't you want people
treat you with respect?

365
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:01,946
Yo! I get respect.

366
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:03,845
I don't give it up to
every dick in my face.

367
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:07,176
Every "dick" in your face.

368
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,528
That's respectful.

369
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:15,949
Put this on.
Wear that for the rest...

370
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:19,000
Hey I said wear that
for the rest of the day.

371
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,642
Okay?

372
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:22,160
Can I go now?

373
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,012
I supposed you can, I mean.

374
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:28,033
If we're done.
Are we done?

375
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:31,214
- We're done.
- We're done.

376
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,625
Another student saved.

377
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,075
Come out of
the bathroom, grandma!

378
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,826
Come on granma,
open the door.

379
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:45,867
Hi, grandpa.

380
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,598
Grandpa.

381
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:51,560
Grandpa.

382
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:53,801
You okay?

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,640
What is it, grandpa?

384
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,571
It's Henry, grandpa.

385
00:24:58,421 --> 00:24:59,912
Grandpa, it's Henry.

386
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,472
- Who?
- Are you in pain?

387
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:05,772
No, no. I ...
I pissed myself.

388
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,085
Come on, grandma,
open the door!

389
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:14,305
Excuse me

390
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:15,567
Excuse me

391
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,776
- Can you come in here please?
- We have a little accident?

392
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,958
- Yes
-  You should ... haa..

393
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,069
- Do you wanna? - No, no.
- See, we're taking care of it.

394
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,360
See? You're okay.

395
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,581
- You right? - Are you doin'
any writing, grandpa?

396
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,472
In the journals?

397
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:38,109
No, my life ...

398
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:42,654
My life isn't worth memoires.

399
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,304
It's ok, it's okay.

400
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:49,415
I didn't wanna to go
out like this.

401
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:52,586
I hate being a burden.

402
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:54,336
You're not a burden.

403
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,664
Okay?

404
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,757
You're not a burden.

405
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:03,068
Sure. You...
You like coming here, huh?

406
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,670
Your mother came by today.

407
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,390
Have you spoken to her lately?

408
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:12,981
No.

409
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:18,672
Now, you tell her
I'm fine?

410
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:25,085
You always say you're fine, but
I know you hide things from me.

411
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,476
You've always been closed off.

412
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:30,306
Ever since you were a kid.

413
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,153
Why is that? Huh?

414
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,751
Why?

415
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:42,590
Ah, you're upset. I shouldn't
say these things to you...

416
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,091
- I don't mean to make you...
- You haven't upset me, grandpa.

417
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,181
It's that I don't wanna
talk about the past.

418
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:53,143
You and I remember it
very differently.

419
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:57,574
Get rest, O.K?
Close your eyes. I'm here.

420
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:03,095
- I am in here with you
- When you stop coming, Henry

421
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:05,015
I'll die.

422
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,517
Fuck.

423
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,008
You got a smoke?

424
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,479
No, I don't have a smoke.

425
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,101
Where'd you go, huh?

426
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:01,441
- What are you gonna do now?
- What are you gonna do, little kid?

427
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,932
I don't know.

428
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:07,493
Can you lend me ten bucks?

429
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,913
Come on, man I'm hungry.

430
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:25,988
I may have something
to eat at my place.

431
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,646
Come in, wash your hands.

432
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:45,183
There's soap over there.

433
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:01,177
Sit down.

434
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,279
Really nice place you got.

435
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:18,733
Thanks.

436
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:26,204
- You got anything stronger?
- Eat your sandwich.

437
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,722
Hey, hold on man!

438
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,722
- It's a 100 bucks.
- Relax...

439
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,581
What?

440
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,142
- Have you been raped recently?
- What do you care?

441
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:33,404
I'm not sure
that I do particulary.

442
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:37,534
I can put something on it.

443
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:51,028
Look, I gotta get back.

444
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,310
Back?

445
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:53,748
Back where?

446
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:55,779
Listen, buddy,

447
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,460
If you don't got the
money it's cool. I mean,

448
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,770
I like you.

449
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:01,511
I'll blow you for 50?

450
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,561
Listen to me,

451
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,422
knock off the bullsit, okay?

452
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:09,993
Come in the bathroom.

453
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:28,588
It's gonna sting a little bit.

454
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,279
Why are you doing this?

455
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,977
Take a shower

456
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,142
- This is fresh towel.
- Thanks.

457
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,031
Go to sleep.

458
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:09,146
Hello, this is Dr. Parker

459
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:12,548
My son's ADHD and I looked it up
online, and that's what hes' got.

460
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,028
Now you gotta
get him a free laptop.

461
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,628
Mr. Kevin, your son Oliver
injured a student.

462
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:19,548
His problems are behavioral.

463
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,549
Hey, my kid's got a disability
and he's not learning anything,

464
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:23,730
and tit's your fault!

465
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,500
Hey, hey...
What are you doing?

466
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:27,901
What is the matter with you?

467
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,202
As it is, our resources emaciated.

468
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:33,223
Now, I heave real LD kids
that need my attention.

469
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:37,303
He's always mad all the time because
he's not getting the services he needs.

470
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:40,884
No Child Left Behind
promises me my rights.

471
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:44,656
You'll be hearing from
my lawyer. - Mr...

472
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:27,758
Hey, what are you doing?
What is this?

473
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,770
What is this? Funny? Get to
class. Get to class right now.

474
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:39,521
What's the joke?
I don't get the joke. Huh?

475
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:42,022
Is this funny? Does that
look good to you?

476
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:45,923
You like hurting animals? Huh?!
Is that what you like to do?

477
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:49,063
Answer me! You like hurting
animals? You like this?!

478
00:34:49,063 --> 00:34:52,635
Come here. Go.
Lets go. Come on.

479
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,815
Walk

480
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:03,527
Mr. Raymond, the studies
have shown that kids

481
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:06,078
who are prone to hurting
animals at an early age

482
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:09,220
eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

483
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:13,730
who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

484
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,480
David.

485
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,175
How do you feel about this?

486
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,945
I feel ...

487
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:24,221
Trapped.

488
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,584
Like the cat.

489
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:04,886
Fuck.

490
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:07,591
Who are you? Why?

491
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:10,196
Did you pay?
Did you pay her?

492
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:13,287
- Yeah alright, here...
-  Pay her!

493
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:17,439
- Alright, here, take...
- What are you paying me for, huh?!

494
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:18,899
It wasn't in my mouth!

495
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:22,840
Get the fuck out of here.
Get out of here! Fuck!

496
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,181
Don't hurt me!

497
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:35,588
Here ...

498
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:40,534
Change your sheets!

499
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,678
How do you do it kid?

500
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,869
Please don't be mad at me.

501
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,210
I am not mad at you.

502
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,111
Don't think about
leaving me.

503
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,792
I won't do it anymore,
I promise.

504
00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:10,872
You don't need to promise me.

505
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:15,124
Okay don't promise to me.

506
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:19,797
Whatever it is, you feel
that you need to do, you do it.

507
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,645
But you don't do it here!

508
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,256
Okay?

509
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:26,316
What are you doing there?

510
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:28,267
Don't you knock?

511
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,879
What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

512
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,620
Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

513
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,881
Like happy with colors.

514
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,731
Whadya want from me dad, besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

515
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,905
I don't work all day

516
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:47,073
to have my night ruined
by your teen angst.

517
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:50,973
♪♪♪

518
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:55,355
I am not goin' to support you
and your little creative habits!

519
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:58,406
Okay? I've had it with all
of all your little art projects

520
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,306
that are going nowhere!

521
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:02,837
You always know
what to say, dad.

522
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:07,909
Now, if you cleared...

523
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:08,128
and lost some weight

524
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,800
you could attract
a nice boys, who knows.

525
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,399
There should be

526
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:20,421
a prerequisite,

527
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:26,564
curriculum for being an parent,
before people attempt....

528
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:32,165
Don't try this at home.

529
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:37,687
Take these.

530
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,468
What are those?

531
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,908
You're supposed to ask me
before you take them.

532
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,369
They're vitamins,

533
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,631
and Aspirin.

534
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:52,363
At some point umm

535
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,882
you should get an HIV test.

536
00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:00,573
At some point.

537
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:16,977
Why were you crying on the bus?

538
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,831
Go to sleep.

539
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:49,373
He a friend of yours?

540
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,067
A friend.

541
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,127
Oh...No, no...um

542
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:55,838
Glausen had no friends....He was ...um.

543
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:57,678
Total asshole.

544
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,829
What was his problem?

545
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,620
He chose a vocation that
did not choose him.

546
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,570
And then he spent his
whole career

547
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,842
"casting pearls before swine",
He talked like that...

548
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,053
The child-hater, basically.

549
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:18,364
He tried to purge Steinbeck and
Faulkner from required reading list.

550
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:22,085
Well, let it be said from
the safety of his sabbatical,

551
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:25,726
Glausen, you can do no more harm.  Ha!

552
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,427
How did he die?

553
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:30,297
Who knows, and um.. who cares?

554
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:42,732
"Lupe"

555
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,752

00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,849

00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:06,117
"Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run."

566
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,248
" We're the ones on trial!"

567
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:10,659

568
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:12,879

571
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,161

00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,731
"No minds to be..."

573
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,719
" Assimilate "

574
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:50,179
What does that mean?

575
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:53,731
To take something in.

576
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:55,411
OK, excellent. To absorb.

577
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:58,667
" Ubiquitous "

578
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,206
Anyone?

579
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,633
Everywhere, all the time.

580
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:08,294
So what.is..

581
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:12,325
"ubiquitous assimilation" ?

582
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,307
Always absorbing everything
everywhere all the time.

583
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,255
Well done, George.

584
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,128
How are you
to imagine anything,

585
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:25,010
if the images are always
provided for you?

586
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,190
Who here read
"1984" last year?

587
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,661
Good.

588
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,171
Anyone?

589
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,062
Meredith.

590
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:42,564
Having two opposing
beliefs at once.

591
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,245
And believing that both are true.

592
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:45,714
Excellent Meredith.

593
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,735
Why do you always suck
his dick, you fuckin' kiss-ass?

594
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:52,446
To deliberately believe in lies

595
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:55,407
while knowning they're false.

596
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,989
Examples of this
in everyday life:

597
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:01,739
Oh, I,

598
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:05,590
need to be pretty
to be happy.

599
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,621
I need surgery
to be pretty.

600
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,732
I need to be thin

601
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:14,109
Famous

602
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:15,576
Fashionable

603
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,504
Our young men,

604
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,325
today,

605
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:23,925
are being told that women

606
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:25,405
are whores;

607
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:27,727
bitches, things to be screwed,

608
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,168
beaten,

609
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:33,458
shit on,

610
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,798
ashamed.

611
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:39,700
This is a marketing holocaust.

612
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,610
24 hours a day,

613
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,570
for the rest of our lives,

614
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:45,992
the powers that be

615
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,072
are hard at work

616
00:43:47,762 --> 00:43:48,813
dumbing us

617
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:51,182
to death.

618
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:54,658
So, to defend ourselves

619
00:43:55,384 --> 00:44:00,895
and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processes,

620
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:02,926
we must learn to read

621
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,466
to stimulate our own imagination;

622
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:06,928
to cultivate

623
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:09,928
our own consciousness,

624
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:12,759
our own belief system.

625
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,210
We all need these skills

626
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,050
to defend

627
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,531
to preserve

628
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:24,732
our own minds.

629
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,475
Just very careful, it's perfect.

630
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,547
Great.

631
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:43,738
Wanna look?

632
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:48,599
You just made your own desolation.

633
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,890
- Wow. I don't care what
they say hon, you're doing great.

634
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,931
I had hard time with
math too. It takes time.

635
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,862
Hmmph wow, that is damn cool.

636
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,402
Hi guys.

637
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,333
Thanks for staying late,

638
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:05,953
all 15 or 20 of you.

639
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:13,986
Today we'll be presented
with a new course work

640
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:15,075
engineered to boost
State exam performance,

641
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:17,156
as mandated by
"No Child Left Behind".

642
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:27,039
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to be here.

643
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:34,531
I've come today with some
edifying materials

644
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,471
to help your matriculating and
non matric students

645
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,972
to better prepare for the
upcoming State Exams this May.

646
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,658
Let me start by stating

647
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:42,323
I love teachers.

648
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:44,554
I love what you do,

649
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:46,394
what you stand for.

650
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:50,456
You guys are the real heroes.

651
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:53,446
Now, the  one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

652
00:45:54,256 --> 00:45:55,347
is that

653
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,757
real estate generates revenue

654
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:01,789
And burgeoning property values
will be this school's saving grades.

655
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,469
But your school's
low test scores

656
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,511
are bringing down the home resale
value in this neighborhood

657
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:12,022
during a market already in decline.

658
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,652
We gotta get scores up -

659
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,693
new families in our district

660
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:20,434
and more motivated
kids in your school.

661
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:22,875
And I'm not placing any blame

662
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,775
Excuse me, are you here
to sell some test materials

663
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:29,116
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

664
00:46:29,126 --> 00:46:32,168
Listen, umm ... I'm curious..

665
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:35,178
Are you givin' away popcorn with
this crap that you're pushing?

666
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:38,639
This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards, and
you tell us

667
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,130
that our careers are
about re-sale value?

668
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:43,597
- Bullshit !
- Give him hell Eadie ...

669
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,511
- Storm the gate.
- Don't oversimplify it, ma'am.

670
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,082
That's a hazard you
can't afford.

671
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:48,371
That sounds like a threat.

672
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:49,922
- Could you please sit down?

673
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:51,243
That's enough.
Could you please sit down?

674
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,913
Can we have some
order here, please.

675
00:46:55,803 --> 00:46:57,474
Dr. Hart was right.

676
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,466
- Your school's the pride of
the district. - Yeah, you bet pal.

677
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:02,286
Could you finish your pitch,
we'd like to go home?

678
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:03,916
What's you hurry, hon?

679
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:06,706
I hear they putting you out to pasture.

680
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,958
So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months.

681
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:13,519
You're a fossil and
you're fucking done.

682
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:26,332
You ever dread going home?

683
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:31,684
Lately, I don't know what to do
with myself when I'm not in the classroom.

684
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,305
So, Friday afternoons
I am afraid to go home.

685
00:47:35,845 --> 00:47:38,126
Afraid of all that time alone.

686
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:41,426
Yeah.

687
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,718
- My mother hates
my father passionately...

688
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:51,499
...watches a lot of TV
...probably the only time i don't feel naked...not a temporary one
...on a permanent basis

689
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:54,349
...the only time that I don't feel

690
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,280
- I teach for selfish reasons...
- My mother was in Mac Madisson

691
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,951
...I need a control

692
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:01,642
- I need those kids more than...

693
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:03,882
- Its the moments in school...

694
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,413
It must be like

695
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:07,653
...best teacher I ever had...

696
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:15,606
So what's your story?

697
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,927
My story?

698
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:27,938
I'm just.. .um.. I'm just taking it
one thing at a time.

699
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,710
Why are you wasting your life?
You know subbing's a dodge.

700
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,081
I teach every day, I mean...Whaddya mean?

701
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,092
I mean you don't really know me.

702
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:40,602
So what happened to you?
-......uh..happened

703
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:51,796
You don't want something
more permanent?

704
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,072
- Hi
- Where have you been?

705
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:13,001
What? I was out.

706
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:18,103
- With a colleague.
- Boy or a girl?

707
00:49:19,014 --> 00:49:21,083
A woman.

708
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:25,965
You make me feel so stupid.
Why do you treat me like a kid?

709
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,526
- Well you are a kid.

710
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,067
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting this.

711
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:37,578
All you had to do was tell me
you were gonna be home later.

712
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,409
Look back up, alright?

713
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:46,140
I'm not beholden to you, okay?

714
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:49,132
I mean, you're welcome
to stay here, but

715
00:49:49,262 --> 00:49:51,921
you know, you don't get to
have expectations of me, alright?

716
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:56,063
This is a temporary thing, you ...
you're able to stay here, but ...

717
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,274
eventually you're gonna
have to go, you understand thst?

718
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,494
- I think it is important...
- It's clear.

719
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:02,905
I get it, you want
me to go now?

720
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:06,596
I got better things to do
than clean up this dump.

721
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:12,047
I can't believe you made dinner.

722
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:14,148
With what?

723
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:18,609
Groceries, from the grocery store.

724
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,991
Wow, it's ah..  It's really nice kid.

725
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:30,672
It's been long time since
somebody's cooked me a home cooked meal.

726
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,034
Thank you Erica.

727
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:38,115
We all have problems, we all
have things that we're dealing with.

728
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,921
And we all ...umm

729
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:45,987
Take them home with us at night,

730
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:49,788
take them to work
with us in the morning.

731
00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:04,112
I think that helplessness, that
realization, that foreboding of

732
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:10,584
being adrift in the sea,
with no

733
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:16,635
no buoy, no safety net, when you
thought you'd be the one.

734
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,996
throwing the buoy.

735
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,991
Hi...

736
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:43,141
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning -

737
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:47,054
- You don't care.
- Oh now ...

738
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:48,964
..that's so untrue my love.

739
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:52,696
You are so condescending.

740
00:51:56,707 --> 00:51:57,917
Give me a kiss.  Hmm?

741
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:05,228
Come on.
no more talking..Will solve everything.

742
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,169
- Come on
- Stop it.

743
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:21,084
Do you remember when
I bought you this?

744
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:27,015
That beautiful summer in Venice

745
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:33,087
before our travels were
resigned to reviving old passions.

746
00:53:58,308 --> 00:54:00,317
- Is that me?
- Yeah

747
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,012
- Grandpa, you doing any writing
of your journal? - No...

748
00:54:41,222 --> 00:54:43,812
I don't remember much.

749
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:50,585
I lost the habit. You
can't think in this place.

750
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:53,086
You can't make new memories.

751
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:13,571
Thank you.

752
00:57:09,812 --> 00:57:11,632
- You alright?
- What?

753
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:15,310
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?

754
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,486
Yeah, I see you, yeah

755
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:24,656
Oh God, its so relentless.
Thank you. Thank ..thank you.

756
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:47,753
"Carol, there's no nice way
for me to do this."

757
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:50,574
"I spoke with the Superintendent"

758
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:55,586
"He's agreed to let you ride
out the rest of the year "

759
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:55,606
" It is what it is."

760
00:57:55,705 --> 00:58:00,847
"Take your pension..go to that beautiful house of yours."

761
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:12,110
Haven't you ever had enough.

762
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:16,241
Haven't you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off.

763
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:16,580
I think I'm sick.

764
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:19,542
- Huh?
-  I crossed the line today.

765
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:23,773
I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

766
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:26,704
Whole thing is fucked,
is it not?

767
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:29,954
What up, Dr.Parker?

768
00:58:30,155 --> 00:58:32,596
Can we get this over with?
I got shit to do.

769
00:58:35,476 --> 00:58:38,857
Ok, so what are your plans after High School missy
since you're not going to college?

770
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:40,588
I don't know.

771
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,589
Hang out with my boyfriend.
Do some modeling shit...

772
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,910
- Be in my friend's band.
- Well I have your 10-week grade report

773
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:50,841
You know what it says?

774
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:52,799
F, F, F, F, F.

775
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,931
- F, F, F yah.

776
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,583
You know what that means?
It mean you don't care.

777
00:58:57,587 --> 00:58:59,154
You're brilliant.

778
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:05,141
Can I go now?

779
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,776
Oh god, you are a shallow
disgusting creature.

780
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:16,118
You want to know the truth?
One, you're not gonna be in a band

781
00:59:16,118 --> 00:59:19,589
or an Model Missy,
because you have no ambition.

782
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,899
With no skills, you'll be competing

783
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:26,911
with the 80% of the U.S. workforce
for a minimum wage job

784
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:28,411
til you're replaced by a computer.

785
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:30,222
- I don't care
- Two...

786
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:33,603
The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

787
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:36,183
Your life will basically
become a carnival of pain.

788
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:37,653
Now, when you can't stand it

789
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:41,144
not one more day,
not one more hour,

790
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:45,435
it will get worse,
much worse!

791
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:52,298
Every day I come into this office and
I listen to you kids shit all over yourselves!

792
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:58,609
It is so easy to be callous. It takes
courage and character to care.

793
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,850
Not that you have any
of those qualities.

794
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:07,932
- Get out! Just get out!
Get out! - Fuck You!!!

795
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:15,614
- I am a total burn out.
- You are not.

796
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:19,675
- I am. - I mean I don't know how
you make it through the day.

797
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:24,636
Come on, listen, seriously why do you
think I take these pills for?

798
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:26,616
I mean, that's a rubber room in there.

799
01:00:27,277 --> 01:00:31,929
If I didn't take these things I'd be
committing mass murder on half of these parents.

800
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,950
and I'll be helping throwing their
fucking kids out of the window.

801
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,983
Come on, you're the best.

802
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,739
I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job

803
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:43,782
is that nobody says thank you.

804
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:46,422
- No.
- No.

805
01:00:47,432 --> 01:00:49,833
Well I am here to say thank you.

806
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:51,994
You're doing the job,
that none of us can do.

807
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:53,613
None of us.

808
01:00:54,725 --> 01:01:00,216
- Grace? - Have I ever I told you
that you're the only person

809
01:01:00,216 --> 01:01:02,596
I have to talk to.

810
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:13,307
- Hi Henry
- What happened?

811
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:15,440
They called to your house.

812
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,471
- Your grandfather felt
some chest pains. - Yeah?

813
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:22,272
The Doctor says he's stable.

814
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:24,823
He doesn't have a lot of time.

815
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:29,863
- I am so sorry Henry
- How long ...

816
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:31,034
...have you been here?

817
01:01:31,405 --> 01:01:34,025
Since this morning, I didn't know
how to get ahold of you?

818
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:36,966
I don't know where you work.

819
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:40,177
You've been here
all day with him?

820
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,810
Hi, Grandpa.

821
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,541
You're still hanging
in there, I see.

822
01:01:54,612 --> 01:02:00,323
Oh, hi sweetheart. Your mother
was with me today.

823
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:03,793
Did you see her?

824
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:11,395
- No. - I told her I was
afraid to leave you.

825
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:15,096
...but she promised

826
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:19,648
that she'd look after you.
- Well, I'm sure she meant it.

827
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,899
- Patricia, darling...

828
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:28,985
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

829
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:42,854
- What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

830
01:02:45,135 --> 01:02:49,146
- Well, those things.
You know, the things I did.

831
01:02:49,596 --> 01:02:53,197
- All you ever did
was take care of me.

832
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:58,218
- Always looked after me.
- Weren't you afraid of me?

833
01:02:58,989 --> 01:03:03,020
No, daddy, not.

834
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:07,200
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up.

835
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:13,253
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do.

836
01:03:13,552 --> 01:03:16,533
So I wasn't the one
that hurt you?

837
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:21,265
No sir, that wasn't you.

838
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:24,836
I'd hoped it wasn't true.

839
01:03:25,236 --> 01:03:31,258
Patricia, darling.
I've always loved you.

840
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:44,801
Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

841
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:51,244
You know that?
It's okay.

842
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:54,804
There's nothing to fear.

843
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:10,258
Come on.

844
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:13,729
Let's get outa here.

845
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:22,452
Is Patricia your mom?
What happened to her?

846
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:24,632
She left a while ago.

847
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:27,184
You mean she died?

848
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:35,416
How did she die?

849
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:42,378
My father left when I was a kid.
I don't really remember him.

850
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:48,409
It was always the three of us,
mother and grandpa and I together

851
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:51,000
in his house.

852
01:04:54,111 --> 01:04:57,331
I found her... on the floor.

853
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:04,303
She'd taken enough pills...so ahh

854
01:05:08,424 --> 01:05:13,036
and grandpa on the moment,
kinda of lost it...

855
01:05:15,196 --> 01:05:17,726
I sat with grandpa
on the porch, and

856
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:22,778
and we watched as they
came and took her away.

857
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:24,997
How old were you?

858
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:32,401
Seven.

859
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:36,532
I don't know for sure,
but I...

860
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:42,054
think my mother was young
when something happened.

861
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:46,735
with her and grandpa.
- Were you afraid of him?

862
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:48,276
No.

863
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:53,287
Did she ever say
anything to you?

864
01:05:56,457 --> 01:05:58,058
No.

865
01:05:59,058 --> 01:06:04,460
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

866
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:06,499
How?

867
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:13,553
She made me lock
my door at night.

868
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:44,150
The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned chain about it

869
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:49,992
The jungle Jim, the slide and
swing  have rusted together.

870
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,834
They're all so terribly alone now.

871
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,155
Where did all the children go?

872
01:06:57,024 --> 01:06:59,255
Didn't they know that
the park needed them?

873
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:05,196
A child's intelligent heart can fathom
the depth of many dark places.

874
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,598
But can it fathom
the delicate
moment of its own detachment?

875
01:07:26,412 --> 01:07:29,123
- Hi Mr. Barthes.
- Hi Meredith.

876
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,235
- How's it going?
- Fine, I..

877
01:07:34,195 --> 01:07:37,055
- I made a picture for you.

878
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:38,926
Come here.

879
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:42,037
- You did?
- Yeah

880
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:54,580
Wow, it's beautiful, and it's a...
You're really talented.

881
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,121
- Thanks. Have you been
doing this for a long time?

882
01:07:57,121 --> 01:08:00,132
Yeah, I've been doing it
since I was a kid.

883
01:08:01,752 --> 01:08:04,302
A Faceless man in an empty room.

884
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,133
Is that how you see me, Meredith?

885
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:10,704
I don't know how I see you.

886
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:14,276
It's just how thought
of you in a situation.

887
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:17,887
Do you ever think about who
your teachers are on the outside?

888
01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:20,878
- In real life?
- I guess so, yeah

889
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:25,599
- Does this place seem unreal to you?
- I watch you around the school,

890
01:08:27,089 --> 01:08:29,187
You always seem so sad

891
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:38,552
Like..maybe you have a hard time with things
and you need someone to talk to

892
01:08:42,028 --> 01:08:44,444
- Meredith
- Yes Sir

893
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:53,486
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yes, will you talk to me?

894
01:08:55,977 --> 01:09:00,268
When you talk to me, when you look
at me, it's like you really see me.

895
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:03,679
I do see you Meredith

896
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,940
- Do you wanna go
see Dr. Parker?

897
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,790
- Oh come on, don't blow me off with the guidance counselor

898
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,719
I am not, I am not ...

899
01:09:12,932 --> 01:09:14,932
What can I do?

900
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:19,393
It's like you said, we're...

901
01:09:19,395 --> 01:09:24,504
There is nothing left. Nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are...

902
01:09:24,506 --> 01:09:26,915
It's not enough. I won't last.

903
01:09:27,646 --> 01:09:30,346
Listen to me. Just listen.

904
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,348
We're all the same.

905
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,899
We all feel pain.

906
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:43,610
We all have chaos
in our lives.

907
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:47,021
Life is very, very
confusing, I know.

908
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:51,243
I don't have the answers,
but I know if you ride it out

909
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:54,783
It'll all be okay.

910
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:59,955
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do.

911
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,698
- Meredith, please don't.
You know I'd like to help you.

912
01:10:11,798 --> 01:10:14,349
- Please, please.
- No, no.

913
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:17,789
- You don't ...
- You said you liked me, please...

914
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:19,921
Please, please...

915
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,541
Oh please,
don't push me away.

916
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:27,542
Please, just hold on to me, and tell
me that everything's gonna be O.K.

917
01:10:27,544 --> 01:10:29,383
Everything is...
It is okay, please.

918
01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:39,725
- Please... no, no...
- Meredith, wait a second.

919
01:10:40,496 --> 01:10:42,546
- What's going on?
- What?

920
01:10:42,926 --> 01:10:44,467
- Meredith, Meredith
- What were you just doing?

921
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,510
Meredith, I am sorry.

922
01:10:47,688 --> 01:10:49,140
- What were you doing?
- What?

923
01:10:50,071 --> 01:10:51,659
What are you doing?

924
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:54,070
- Excuse me?!
- You were just touching her.

925
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,081
What do you ... what are
you insinuating?

926
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:58,971
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

927
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:01,361
It is inappropriate?!
She needed someone to talk to.

928
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:04,793
- What do you think I'm doing, huh lady?
- I don't know what you're doing.

929
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:06,433
"Just hold me close."

930
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,984
What do you think I'm a fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

931
01:11:09,254 --> 01:11:11,015
She needed someone
to talk to her.

932
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:14,355
- Well, then why were you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her.  You fucking....

933
01:11:14,506 --> 01:11:16,175
"I'm sorry my dear."

934
01:11:18,897 --> 01:11:20,427
"Patricia?"

935
01:11:20,765 --> 01:11:23,311
I'm not ... not some sick old man!

936
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:26,759
Is that what you
think of me?

937
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,439
Is that what you think?

938
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:34,311
I just wanted to help her!

939
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,602
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

940
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:45,823
You're supposed to...
Fucking so.. fucking judgemental!

941
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:06,165
Hello, no he's not home.

942
01:12:30,297 --> 01:12:32,346
Hello Mr. Barthes.

943
01:12:34,577 --> 01:12:40,588
Ahh, whenever you feel like you're ready
we do uhh have some paperwork downstairs

944
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:42,649
that we need you to
take care of.

945
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:49,998
I'm sorry.

946
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:38,365
I wish things were different.

947
01:13:39,535 --> 01:13:46,927
I tried, huh you know... Fuck..fucked up thing
thing is..that.. We all...

948
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:54,530
We all have problems. We all
have things that we're dealing with right?

949
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,570
Some days were better than others.
Somedays were not so great.

950
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:03,372
Some days we have uhh...
limited space

951
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:05,332
for others.

952
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:23,897
Hey. Don't be impressed. I made breakfast.

953
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:26,856
Want some milk?

954
01:14:29,249 --> 01:14:33,310
These kids need.......
something else.

955
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,747
They don't need me.

956
01:14:43,932 --> 01:14:46,604
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

957
01:14:56,776 --> 01:15:01,008
- You know, you can't...you can't
keep living on the street.

958
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:03,988
I am not. I mean, I'm staying
here with you.

959
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,809
Well you..you can't continue
to stay here with me.

960
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,900
- I mean, I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

961
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,891
You're the only family
I've ever had.

962
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,702
Why, I can't be your family.

963
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,825
I can't give you what you need.

964
01:15:35,887 --> 01:15:38,949
- You have to understand,
you should be... - You are good...

965
01:15:39,562 --> 01:15:41,786
And gentle ...

966
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:45,299
You're the most kind.

967
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:53,382
I love you Henry.

968
01:16:00,114 --> 01:16:02,854
- Come on in. -Hi.
- Hi.

969
01:16:04,025 --> 01:16:05,265
Hello there.

970
01:16:06,826 --> 01:16:10,797
- Erica ...
- Don't let them take me...

971
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:12,337
Please...

972
01:16:13,728 --> 01:16:15,818
- Noo...
- Listen, you should...

973
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:19,729
You're all
I have, please...

974
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:23,751
- Don't let me go.
- You should go, sorry.

975
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:26,586
- No, no ...
- No, don't do this ...

976
01:16:27,265 --> 01:16:28,298
- Henry! Henry!
- You should go

977
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:29,992
- Henry!
- You have to let go.

978
01:16:29,996 --> 01:16:32,068
- Henry!
- You have to ...

979
01:16:33,003 --> 01:16:35,644
- Henry!
- You have to leg go now.

980
01:16:35,645 --> 01:16:37,730
Henry!

981
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:40,244
- Her things?
- Yeah.

982
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,173
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

983
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:47,656
- No! No! ...
- It's gonna be okay.

984
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,268
Don't do this.

985
01:16:50,268 --> 01:16:53,988
- You gonna be okay.
- No! No! No!

986
01:16:54,385 --> 01:16:57,039
No! ...

987
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:48,153
Well ... I feel
just awful for her.

988
01:17:49,785 --> 01:17:51,594
- For who?
-  Our school.

989
01:17:52,445 --> 01:17:58,296
It may sound baroque, but I have always
felt that the school had a spirit.

990
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:02,679
It's not just an bunch of old buildings,
but they're alive.

991
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:11,160
I..I just don't understand it.
Where are all the parents? Hmm?

992
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,886
I don't know.

993
01:18:22,543 --> 01:18:26,065
I was in my room for two
hours and saw one parent.

994
01:18:26,074 --> 01:18:28,074
Where are they?
Where is everybody?

995
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,075
- We don't know.
- It's uncanny.

996
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:34,946
No air raid sirensl
No bombs.

997
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,647
It doesn't happen that way.

998
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:40,799
It starts in a whisper,
then nothing.

999
01:18:41,038 --> 01:18:43,069
We had our music once,
didn't we?

1000
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,179
Yes, we did.
-Ahh

1001
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,191
Hey, do you remember those nights
when we had two parents at a time?

1002
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:53,852
And then there were more,
there were many more

1003
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:58,864
waiting in the waiting rooms. -Um hmmm.

1004
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,743
And halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.    -Ummm

1005
01:19:00,893 --> 01:19:04,585
Rememberance. The things passed.

1006
01:19:04,794 --> 01:19:07,086
I actually felt quite at home.

1007
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:08,955
But there were no parents.
Heheh

1008
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:14,777
I thought how appropriate.
It was like, a moment of insight

1009
01:19:15,938 --> 01:19:20,189
into the reality of the fucking
problem in the first place.

1010
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:30,271
Some of us... believe that
we can make a difference.

1011
01:19:31,342 --> 01:19:33,983
And then sometimes we wake up

1012
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:38,744
and we realize we've failed.

1013
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:53,208
Hi, this is Gretchen
calling from the free clinic,

1014
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,779
Erica Louis' test results are back.

1015
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:58,859
Please give us a call
at your earliest convenience.

1016
01:19:58,861 --> 01:19:59,673
Thank you.

1017
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,926
" - You have good parents "
" - Bitch you shut up. "

1018
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:30,213
"A Mother of mine gave her ... "

1019
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:34,270
" Ya dyke Bitch! "
" ha ha...ha ha ... ha ha"

1020
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:38,090
" What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?"

1021
01:20:42,762 --> 01:20:45,408
" - I won't last!"
".....fucked up things are...."
"Are you picking a fight?"
" - Paint something more cheerful ..."

1022
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:50,363
" We have to pay us our lives ..."
" Grow like your hair, lost some weight"

1023
01:20:50,364 --> 01:20:51,704
" It'll all be okay "

1024
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:56,076
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

1025
01:20:56,076 --> 01:20:58,296
Before we take roll,

1026
01:20:58,296 --> 01:21:03,337
I want to tell you that umm.. today
will be my last day with you.

1027
01:21:04,388 --> 01:21:06,448
You're gonna have
a permanent teacher on Monday.

1028
01:21:06,548 --> 01:21:09,199
- Where are you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I'll go to another school.

1029
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:14,990
- I'm gon  miss you, man.   I fucks wit you.
- Yeah?

1030
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:17,752
All the other teachers in
this place... They're dickheads.

1031
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:21,275
So you don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?

1032
01:21:21,472 --> 01:21:27,184
It's ahh..it'show my job works, Tanya. I..I....come
in here for..... a period of time,

1033
01:21:27,184 --> 01:21:29,215
so you don't have twenty
subs in and outta here,

1034
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:34,226
and then, you have a
permanent teacher come in

1035
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:36,517
and I leave.

1036
01:21:38,287 --> 01:21:43,249
Attention to all teachers, this is a special
announcement from the Principals Office.

1037
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:47,469
There will an all faculty meeting
today, during nutrition"

1038
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,900
Student nutrition will be extended

1039
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,152
by ten minutes, thank you.

1040
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:44,486
Ahem......I invited you here today
to discuss the state of things.

1041
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:49,037
I know that there wasn't a...
I know that there isn't ...

1042
01:22:56,858 --> 01:23:00,549
- I'm sorry ...
- We all need something,

1043
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:07,921
to distract us from....
complexity and reality.

1044
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,722
No one wants to think about
where that came from?

1045
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:19,125
No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes

1046
01:23:19,155 --> 01:23:22,155
to become somebody
to get out of

1047
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:28,102
... to get out of the ...

1048
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:31,468
the sea of pain that,
we all have to get out of.

1049
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,071
- Hi Meredith.
- Hi.

1050
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,223
Haven't seen you
in class lately?

1051
01:23:48,006 --> 01:23:49,530
Well, where have you been?

1052
01:23:50,023 --> 01:23:52,464
- Baking.
- I see.

-yep

1053
01:23:53,634 --> 01:23:56,175
- I am happy I get to see you.
Today is my last day.

1054
01:23:57,285 --> 01:23:59,946
How ironic.

1055
01:24:00,616 --> 01:24:04,447
Listen, I umm..I was thinking,
I bought this for myself, but

1056
01:24:05,428 --> 01:24:09,709
maybe you could umm.. make
better use of it.

1057
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,422
- I like that one the best.
- You can't have that one.

1058
01:24:24,923 --> 01:24:26,633
It's mine.

1059
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:31,465
But, you can have this one?

1060
01:24:31,854 --> 01:24:34,356
- It's better for you anyway.
- Thanks.

1061
01:24:35,706 --> 01:24:37,346
I'm sorry.

1062
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:42,528
If I hurt you
in any way, I um ...

1063
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:51,150
I know....... that its tough
right now, for you,

1064
01:24:51,151 --> 01:24:56,112
but it's not always gonna be this...
- Goodbye Mr. Barthes.

1065
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:02,764
Goodbye Meredith.

1066
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:50,567
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to a temporary problem.

1067
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:53,397
I'll let you know.

1068
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:59,339
My name is Meredith and
I wanted to kill myself.

1069
01:26:31,288 --> 01:26:32,908
Meredith!

1070
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:34,859
No!

1071
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:39,060
Henry!

1072
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:44,831
It was gonna be O.K.
It's gonna be O.K.

1073
01:26:47,572 --> 01:26:51,174
It was gonna be O.K.

1074
01:26:55,064 --> 01:27:03,366
We have such a responsibility to.... guide
our young so that they don't end up

1075
01:27:04,326 --> 01:27:06,987
falling apart.

1076
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:10,249
Falling by the wayside.

1077
01:27:13,556 --> 01:27:16,136
Becoming insignificant.

1078
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,332
I realized something today.

1079
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:47,855
I'm a non-person, Sarah.

1080
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:56,767
You shouldn't be here.
I'm not here.

1081
01:28:59,078 --> 01:29:01,770
You may see me,

1082
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:08,561
but I'm hollow.

1083
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:46,302
We're Failing.
We're failing.

1084
01:29:49,202 --> 01:29:56,013
We failed in a sense that we
have let everyone down.

1085
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:58,559
Including ourselves.

1086
01:31:08,204 --> 01:31:11,755
When you're walking down
the hallway, or in your class,

1087
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,655
how many of you

1088
01:31:16,456 --> 01:31:22,727
have ever felt the weight
pressing down on you?

1089
01:31:24,338 --> 01:31:26,599
Hmm?   I have.

1090
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:32,161
Everyone?

1091
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:34,291
Wow!

1092
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:38,563
Poe wrote about these
things over a 100 years ago.

1093
01:31:38,602 --> 01:31:42,423
So, as we read

1094
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:45,865
we can see that

1095
01:31:45,885 --> 01:31:49,266
"The House of Usher"
is not merely an old

1096
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:52,696
decrepit castle in disrepair.

1097
01:31:54,026 --> 01:31:57,728
It's also a state of being.
