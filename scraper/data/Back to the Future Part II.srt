1
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:47,707
How about a ride, mister?

2
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,623
Jennifer.

3
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,832
Man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

4
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,331
Let me look at you.

5
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:59,623
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

6
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:01,540
I haven't.

7
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,997
Are you okay? Is everything all right?

8
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:10,331
Yeah.

9
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:12,956
Everything's great.

10
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:28,247
Marty!

11
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:31,539
You've got to come back with me.

12
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,663
- Where?
- Back to the future.

13
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,162
- Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?
- I need fuel.

14
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,121
Go ahead. Quick. Get in the car.

15
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,579
No. Look, Doc, I just got here.
Jennifer's here.

16
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:53,037
We're going to take
the new truck for a spin.

17
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,870
Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

18
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:59,745
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

19
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,204
Do we become assholes or something?

20
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,870
No. You and Jennifer both turn out fine.

21
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:08,453
It's your kids, Marty.
Something's got to be done about them.

22
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:18,453
Doc, you better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

23
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:23,078
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

24
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,244
Say, Marty!

25
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:28,411
Marty, I wanted to show
you these new matchbooks...

26
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:31,077
...for my auto detailing I had printed up.

27
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,494
A flying DeLorean?

28
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,994
What the hell is going on here?

29
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,239
- What the hell was that?
- Taxicab.

30
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:32,156
- Taxicab? I thought we were flying.
- Precisely.

31
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,281
All right, Doc. What's going on?

32
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:36,364
Where are we? When are we?

33
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,572
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California...

34
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,864
<i>...at 4:29 p.m...</i>

35
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:45,363
<i>...on Wednesday, October 21, 2015.</i>

36
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,071
2015?

37
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
You mean we're in the future.

38
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,196
What do you mean?
How can we be in the future?

39
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,488
Jennifer...

40
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,113
...I don't know how to tell you this, but...

41
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,404
...you're in a time machine.

42
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,571
- And this is the year 2015?
- October 21, 2015.

43
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:09,946
God, so, like, you weren't kidding.

44
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,737
Marty, we can actually see our future.

45
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,112
You said we were married, right?

46
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:18,154
- Yeah...
- Yeah? Was it a big wedding?

47
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:21,028
- We're going to see our wedding!
- Wow.

48
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,778
- I'll see my wedding dress.
- Wow.

49
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:27,486
I wonder where we live.
I bet it's a big house with lots of kids.

50
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,945
How many kids--

51
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,570
- Doc! What the hell are you doing?
- Relax.

52
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,236
It's a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.

53
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,486
No one should know
too much about their future.

54
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,319
<i>When she wakes up,</i>
<i>she'll think it was a dream.</i>

55
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,652
- What did you bring her for?
- I had to do something.

56
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:47,153
She saw the time machine.
I couldn't leave her with that information.

57
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,861
Don't worry.
She's not essential to my plan.

58
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,027
Well, you're the doc, Doc.

59
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,777
Here's our exit.

60
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,693
You've got to get out
and change clothes.

61
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,568
Right now? It's pouring rain.

62
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,525
Wait five more seconds.

63
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,275
Right on the tick.

64
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,400
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

65
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:48,692
Too bad the post office
isn't as efficient as the weather service.

66
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,482
Excuse the disguise, but I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.

67
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,733
I went to a rejuvenation clinic
and got a whole natural overhaul.

68
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:06,357
<i>Took out some wrinkles,</i>
<i>did a hair repair, changed the blood...</i>

69
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,024
...added 30 or 40 years to my life.

70
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,857
They also replaced my spleen and colon.
What do you think?

71
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:16,190
You look great, Doc.

72
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,024
The future.

73
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,231
Unbelievable.

74
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,648
- I got to check this out, Doc.
- All in good time.

75
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:30,106
- We're on a tight schedule.
- Tell me about my future.

76
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,481
Do I become, like, a rich rock star?

77
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:35,398
No one should know too much
about their destiny.

78
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:39,731
- I am rich, though, right?
- Marty, please, take off your shirt.

79
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,273
Put on the jacket and the shoes.

80
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,397
Got a mission to accomplish.

81
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,855
Precisely on schedule.

82
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:12,187
Power laces. All right.

83
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,854
This thing doesn't fit.

84
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,937
<i>Size-adjusting fit.</i>

85
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:40,228
Pull out your pants pockets.
All kids here wear their pants inside out.

86
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,729
Put on this cap.

87
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:44,604
Perfect. You're the spitting image
of your future son.

88
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,395
- What?
- Help me move Jennifer over here.

89
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,936
- So what's the deal?
- Grab her feet.

90
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,311
Okay, now what?

91
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:58,311
In exactly two minutes,
you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

92
00:08:58,895 --> 00:08:59,978
Cafe '80s?

93
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,977
It's one of those nostalgia places,
but not done well.

94
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,603
Go in and order a Pepsi. Here's $50.

95
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,561
Wait for a guy named Griff.

96
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,227
Right. Griff.

97
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,311
Griff's going to ask about tonight.
Are you in or out?

98
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:13,852
Tell him you are out.

99
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,060
Whatever he says, say no, you're not interested.

100
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:20,226
Then leave,
come back here and wait for me.

101
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,852
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't touch anything.

102
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,351
Don't do anything.
Don't interact with anyone...

103
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,602
...and try not to look at anything.

104
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,934
I don't get it.

105
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:33,976
- You said this had to do with my kids.
- Look what happens to your son.

106
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:36,310
My son?

107
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,018
God, he looks just like me.

108
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:43,726
"Within two hours of his arrest,
Martin McFly Jr...

109
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
"...was tried, convicted, and sentenced
to 15 years in the state penitentiary"?

110
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:49,559
Within two hours?

111
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:53,350
The justice system works swiftly
now that they've abolished lawyers.

112
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:54,850
This is heavy.

113
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:59,600
It gets worse. Your daughter tries
to break him out and gets sent up for 20 years.

114
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,600
My daughter. I have a daughter?

115
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:07,391
This one event starts a chain reaction
that completely destroys your entire family.

116
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,892
Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

117
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:14,765
Precisely. I already went further ahead
into time to see what else happens.

118
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:20,266
I backtracked everything to this one event.
We're here to prevent this event from happening.

119
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,766
Damn! I'm late!

120
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,974
Where are you going now?

121
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,390
To intercept the real Marty Jr.
You're taking his place.

122
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:30,265
The Cafe '80s, guy named Griff, just say no!

123
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,932
What about Jennifer?
We can't just leave her here.

124
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,848
She'll be safe.
It'll just be for a few minutes.

125
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,056
Marty, be careful. That Griff has
a few short circuits in his bionic implants.

126
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,389
The future.

00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:57,381
Must be rough being named after
a complete butthead.

157
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:58,548
What's that mean?

158
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:01,298
Hello. Hello. Anybody home?

159
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,548
Think, McFly, think!

160
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:06,632
Your old man? Mr. Loser?

161
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,631
- What?
- That's right.

162
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,423
Loser with a capital "L."

163
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,589
Look, I happen to know George McFly is--

164
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:18,214
I'm not talking about George McFly.
I'm talking about his kid.

165
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:22,047
Your old man, Marty McFly Sr.?

166
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:27,005
The man who took his life
and flushed it completely down the toilet.

167
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,464
I did?

168
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,880
I mean, he did?

169
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,755
Hey, Gramps...

170
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:38,463
...I told you two coats of wax on my car,
not just one!

171
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,254
I just put the second coat on last week.

172
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:44,796
- With your eyes closed?
- Are you two related?

173
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,254
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

174
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,921
You think Griff called me
Grandpa for his health?

175
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:53,004
- He's Griff?
- Gramps!

176
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,754
What the hell am I paying you for?

177
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,962
Kid, say hello to your grandma for me.

178
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,504
- Get out of there, Gramps.
- Take it easy!

179
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:06,795
And McFly, don't go anywhere!
You're next!

180
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,712
This is a video game.

181
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,670
I got it working.

182
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:17,086
My dad taught me about these.

183
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:19,295
It is Wild Gunman.

184
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,461
How do you play this thing?

185
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:23,212
I'll show you, kid.

186
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:26,252
<i>I'm a crack shot at this.</i>

187
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,628
You mean you have to use your hands?

188
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,711
That's like a baby's toy.

189
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,085
Baby's toy?

190
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:48,919
Pepsi Perfect.

191
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,835
- Damn!
- Pepsi.

192
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:54,210
McFly!

193
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,793
I thought I told you to stay in here!

194
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,876
Guys, how's it going?

195
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,709
- McFly!
- Yeah?

196
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,918
- McFly!
- What?

197
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,834
Your shoe's unbelted.

198
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:18,209
So, McFly, have you made a decision
about tonight's opportunity?

199
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,501
Yeah, Griff. I was thinking about how
I'm not sure because it might be dangerous.

200
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,501
What's wrong, McFly?

201
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,167
You got no scrote?

202
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,084
He's a complete wimp.

203
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,208
What's it going to be, McFly?
Are you in or out?

204
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:46,291
I just, I'm not sure that I should.
I should discuss it with my father.

205
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,124
Your father?

206
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,458
Wrong answer, McFly! You lose!

207
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:56,791
Okay, Griff, I'll do it.
Whatever you say.

208
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,791
Stay down and shut up.

209
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,957
Keep pedaling, you two!

210
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,082
Now...

211
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,082
...let's hear the right answer.

212
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,539
Well!

213
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,873
Since when did you become
the physical type?

214
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:24,873
The answer's no, Griff.

215
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:28,830
- No?
- What are you, deaf and stupid? I said no!

216
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,623
What's wrong, McFly? Chicken?

217
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,331
What did you call me, Griff?

218
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:43,205
Chicken, McFly!

219
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:45,914
Nobody calls me...

220
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,996
...chicken.

221
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,330
- All right, punk!
- Look!

222
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,787
Stop! Little girl, little girl.

223
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,620
Stop. Look, I need to borrow your "hoverboard."

224
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:29,120
- Where is he?
- Here.

225
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:31,578
There!

226
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,411
He's on a hoverboard.

227
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,495
- Get the boards!
- Get McFly!

228
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,702
Get him!

229
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,535
Yeah, we got him!

230
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:17,284
There's something very familiar about all this.

231
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,658
McFly, you bojo!

232
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,367
- Those boards don't work on water!
- Unless you've got power!

233
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,365
Hook on!

234
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:34,198
Batter up!

235
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,030
Holy shit!

236
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,404
Buttheads.

237
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:26,363
<i>Drying mode on.</i>

238
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,654
<i>Jacket drying.</i>

239
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,737
<i>Your jacket is now dry.</i>

240
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,529
Hey, kid. Hey, little girl, thanks.

241
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:41,320
Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.

242
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:43,695
- Come on.
- Save the clock tower!

243
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:48,070
Throw in $100
and help save the clock tower.

244
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,486
Sorry, no.

245
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,653
- That's an important historical landmark!
- Some other time.

246
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:55,444
Lightning struck that thing 60 years ago.

247
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:58,653
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series...

248
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,069
- Against Miami?
- Yeah, it's something, huh?

249
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:05,569
Who would've thought? 100-1 shot!

250
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:08,528
I wish I could go back
to the beginning of the season...

251
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,152
- ...bet on the Cubs.
- I just meant Miami...

252
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:14,319
What did you just say?

253
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:18,610
I wish I could go back to the beginning
of the season, bet on the Cubbies!

254
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:26,694
This has an interesting feature.
It has a dust jacket.

255
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:29,068
Books had these to protect the covers.

256
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:31,568
That was before dust-repellent paper.

257
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,235
If you're interested in dust,
we have something from the 1980s...

258
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,068
...called a Dustbuster.

259
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:45,109
- I can't lose.
- Up here!

260
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:49,234
- Doc, what's going on?
- Stand by. I'll park over there.

261
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,234
Yeah, all right.

262
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:54,984
Hey, right on time.

263
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:57,025
Flying DeLorean?

264
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,650
I haven't seen one in 30 years.

265
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,650
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

266
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:05,900
I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

267
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:11,858
- What the hell?
- Don't drive trank, low-res scuzzball!

268
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,191
Two of them?

269
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,691
I left him in
a suspended animation kennel.

270
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,899
Einstein never knew I was gone!

271
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,607
Marty!

272
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,233
What in the name
of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?

273
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:27,440
Doc, my kid showed up.
All hell broke loose.

274
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:28,941
Your kid?

275
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,399
Great Scott, I was afraid of this.

276
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:37,440
I used it on Jennifer. There wasn't enough
power left to knock your son out for a full hour.

277
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,856
Doc, Doc, look at this!

278
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,399
It's changing.

279
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,022
<i>I was framed!</i>

280
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:59,564
Yes! Yes, of course!

281
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,689
Because this hoverboard incident
occurred, Griff goes to jail.

282
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:09,064
Your son won't go with him tonight.
That robbery won't take place!

283
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:13,730
History, future history,
has been altered, and this is proof!

284
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:18,564
We've succeeded, not as planned,
but no matter. Let's get Jennifer and go home!

285
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:22,480
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.

286
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,646
- What's this?
- A souvenir.

287
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:29,105
50 years of sports statistics."

288
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:31,313
Hardly recreational reading material.

289
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:34,771
Doc, what's the harm
in bringing back some info on the future?

290
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:36,771
We could place some bets.

291
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,813
I didn't invent the time machine
for financial gain!

292
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,813
The intent is to gain
a clearer perception of humanity.

293
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:47,062
Our past, our future,
the pitfalls, the possibilities...

294
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:51,812
...the perils, and the promise. Perhaps an answer
to that universal question, "Why?"

295
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:54,187
I'm all for that.

296
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:56,895
What's wrong with making
a few bucks on the side?

297
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:00,478
I am going to put this in the trash.

298
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:03,562
Great Scott!

299
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:11,186
McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker,
3793 Oakhurst Street...

300
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,978
...Hilldale, age 47.

301
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,978
47? That's a hell
of a good face-lift!

302
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:19,435
- What's happening?
- They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.

303
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,144
Since thumbprints never change,
they assume she's the future Jennifer.

304
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,435
We got to stop them.

305
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,644
How? Tell them we're time travelers?
They'd have us committed.

306
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,893
She's clean. We take her home.

307
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,561
To Hilldale?

308
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,893
<i>We won't get there before dark.</i>

309
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:36,394
They're taking her to your future home!

310
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:40,269
We'll arrive shortly thereafter,
get her, and return to 1985.

311
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,309
I'll see where I live.
See myself as an old man?

312
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:46,476
No, that could result in... Great Scott!

313
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:49,518
Jennifer could conceivably encounter
her future self!

314
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,976
The consequences could be disastrous!

315
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:55,476
- What do you mean?
- I foresee two possibilities.

316
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,226
One, seeing herself 30 years older would
put her into shock, and she'd pass out...

317
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,017
...or two, the encounter
could create a time paradox...

318
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:06,143
...and cause a chain reaction that would unravel...

319
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:09,809
...the space-time continuum
and destroy the entire universe!

320
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,976
Granted, that's a worst-case scenario.

321
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:15,809
The destruction might be localized,
limited to our own galaxy.

322
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,183
Well, that's a relief.

323
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:25,891
Let's go and find Jennifer
before she finds herself.

324
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:30,724
The skyway's jammed.
It'll take forever to get there.

325
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,266
And this stays here!

326
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:37,182
I didn't invent the time machine to win
at gambling, but to travel through time!

327
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,766
I know.

328
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:52,682
So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.

329
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,472
Hilldale.

330
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,347
Nothing but a breeding ground
for tranks, lobos, and zipheads.

331
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:28,305
Yeah, they ought to tear
this whole place down.

332
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:31,972
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

333
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,972
You got a little tranked,
but I think you can walk.

334
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,555
Ma'am, you should reprogram.
It's dangerous in the dark.

335
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:43,055
- Lights on?
- Yes. Now, look.

336
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:46,388
Just take it easy, and you'll be fine.

337
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:48,555
<i>And be careful in the future.</i>

338
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,929
The future?

339
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,179
Have a nice day, Mrs. McFly.

340
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:00,138
<i>Broadcasting beautiful views</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

341
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,846
<i>You're tuned to the Scenery Channel.</i>

342
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:10,012
I'm in the future.

343
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,970
I get married in the Chapel O Love?

344
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,511
Mom? Mom, is that you?

345
00:28:27,594 --> 00:28:29,678
I got to get out of here!

346
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,553
Mom!

347
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:46,760
Mom? Mom, is that you?

348
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,593
- Grandma!
- Sweetheart!

349
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:54,844
Hi!

350
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:58,093
- What happened to Grandpa?
- He threw his back out again.

351
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:01,218
- How's Granddad's little pumpkin?
- How did you do that?

352
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,135
Out on the golf course.

353
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,467
Are your folks home yet?
I brought pizza!

354
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,093
- Who's going to eat all that?
- I will.

355
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:10,884
Damn this traffic!

356
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:14,801
Jennifer, old Jennifer gets home around now.
I hope we're not too late.

357
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:22,342
- What is it? What's the matter, Doc?
- I thought I saw a taxi.

358
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,467
I thought it was following us.

359
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:27,925
I can't believe
this window's still broken.

360
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,717
When the repairman
called Daddy a chicken...

361
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,258
<i>...Daddy threw him out of the house.</i>
<i>Now nobody will fix it.</i>

362
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,300
Look how worn out this is.

363
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:42,508
Your father's biggest problem
is that he loses all self-control...

364
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,550
<i>...when someone calls him chicken.</i>

365
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,508
<i>How often have we heard it?</i>

366
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,674
Mom, I can't let him think I'm chicken."

367
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,216
You're right. Well, you're right!

368
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:56,091
About 30 years ago, your father
tried to prove he wasn't chicken.

369
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:58,382
He ended up in an automobile accident.

370
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,966
With the Rolls-Royce?

371
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,716
Automobile accident.

372
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:16,423
All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer.

373
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:20,381
I live in Hilldale? This is great!

374
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:23,506
Stay here, change clothes.
If I need you, I'll holler.

375
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,214
I want to check out my house.

376
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:28,922
We can't risk you running
into your older self. Einie, let's go.

377
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:32,964
Hilldale.

378
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,006
This is bitchin'.

379
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,255
<i>One, seven, four point five zero.</i>

380
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,006
- That will be $174.50.
- Here.

381
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,839
Be careful in this neighborhood.

382
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:51,255
- Where's my receipt?
- Right here.

383
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,796
How about a tip?

384
00:31:07,838 --> 00:31:11,796
That accident caused a chain reaction,
sending Marty's life down the tubes.

385
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,588
Otherwise, your father's life
would have turned out differently.

386
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,753
<i>The man wouldn't have pressed charges...</i>

387
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:21,004
...Marty wouldn't have broken his hand,
given up on his music...

388
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,712
<i>...and spent years feeling sorry for himself.</i>

389
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,503
Hey, Mom, nice pants.

390
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:28,171
The reason
your mother married him--

391
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:29,503
Mom?

392
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,920
Turn off.

393
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:39,545
I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87, and the Weather Channel.

394
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:43,253
<i>Bringing you</i>
<i>the world's weather 24 hours a day.</i>

395
00:31:43,878 --> 00:31:46,170
<i>Weather conditions remain the same--</i>

396
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:48,377
<i>Board-certified implant surgeons...</i>

397
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,919
<i>Welcome home, Marty.</i>

398
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,210
Dad's home.

399
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:54,919
That's right.
He's home. Dad's home.

400
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,210
- <i>Lord of the manor.</i>
- Hello.

401
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:59,335
- <i>King of the castle.</i>
- Hello.

402
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,835
What the hell is this?

403
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
<i>Lithium mode on.</i>

404
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:06,544
Yeah. That's better.

405
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,419
Damned kids.

406
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:10,085
Hey, Son.

407
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,376
Watching a little TV for a change?

408
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,667
Son of a...

409
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,708
- I'm hungry.
- Just wait your turn.

410
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:13,166
When it's ready,
shove it in my mouth.

411
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:15,166
Don't you be a smart-ass.

412
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,707
Hey! The Atrocity Channel.

413
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,874
Hydrate level 4, please.

414
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,332
Is it ready?

415
00:33:28,415 --> 00:33:29,707
Here you go.

416
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,956
Mom, you sure can
hydrate a pizza.

417
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:36,248
I'm sorry.
I missed that whole thing.

418
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:38,748
I'm just worried about Jennifer.

419
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:43,622
- Why isn't she home?
- I'm not sure where Jennifer is, Mom.

420
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:46,081
She should have been home hours ago.

421
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,664
- I can't keep track--
- Fruit!

422
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:52,456
- Fruit, please.
- She's in one of those moods.

423
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,706
Aren't you and her
getting along?

424
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,456
Yeah. Great, Mom.
We're like a couple of teenagers.

425
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,414
Dad, telephone. It's Needles.

426
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:04,580
Dad, it's for you.

427
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:08,288
All right. Well, I'll take that in the den.

428
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:09,872
Retract.

429
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,121
Hello. In here, please.

430
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:16,580
<i>Hey, the big M.</i>

431
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,622
<i>How's it hanging, McFly?</i>

432
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,371
Hey, Needles.

433
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:21,663
Needles?

434
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:24,121
<i>Did you look</i>
<i>at my little business proposal?</i>

435
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:26,913
- I don't know.
- <i>Why are you worried?</i>

436
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:30,288
<i>If this works,</i>
<i>your financial problems are solved.</i>

437
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,787
And if it doesn't work, Needles,
I could get fired.

438
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,454
It's illegal.
I mean, what if the Jits is monitoring?

439
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:41,078
- <i>The Jits will never find out.</i>
- God.

440
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,703
<i>Come on. Stick your card in the slot,</i>
<i>and I'll handle it.</i>

441
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:50,995
<i>Unless you want everyone</i>
<i>in the division to think you're chicken.</i>

442
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:58,286
Nobody calls me chicken, Needles.

443
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:00,578
- Nobody!
- <i>All right.</i>

444
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,286
<i>Prove it.</i>

445
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,620
All right.

446
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:11,161
All right, Needles.

447
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:15,785
Here's my card.

448
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:18,077
<i>Scan it. I'm in.</i>

449
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,785
<i>Thanks, McFly.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the plant tomorrow.</i>

450
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:25,202
Shit.

451
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:28,951
<i>McFly!</i>

452
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,951
Fujitsu-san.

453
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:33,452
<i>McFly...</i>

454
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:36,993
<i>...I was monitoring that</i>
<i>scan you just interfaced.</i>

455
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:38,409
<i>You are terminated!</i>

456
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:41,659
Terminated. No! It wasn't my fault, sir.

457
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:44,868
- Needles was behind it.
- <i>And you cooperated.</i>

458
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:48,242
It was a sting operation.
I was setting him up.

459
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,201
<i>Read my fax!</i>

460
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:52,701
No! Please! I cannot be fired.

461
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,201
<i>I'm fired.</i>

462
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:07,533
This is heavy.

463
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,867
<i>What am I going to tell Jennifer?</i>

464
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,617
Jennifer. Jennifer.

465
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,241
Doc. Am I glad to see you.

466
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,824
Go out the front door. I'll meet you there.

467
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:21,491
But it doesn't open. There's no doorknob.

468
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:23,866
Press your thumb to the plate.

469
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,657
What plate?

470
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,698
What does this fax mean?

471
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,531
Mom. It's a joke,
an office joke. It's a joke fax.

472
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:49,157
- I heard you yell.
- Calm down. I wasn't yelling.

473
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,032
Needles and I were just joking.

474
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:52,948
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

475
00:36:53,032 --> 00:36:55,615
Lost my job, Mom?
Get out of town.

476
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:02,406
- I'm young!
- I'm old!

477
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:13,198
Marty! Marty!

478
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,697
<i>Marty, come quick! Quick!</i>

479
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:34,946
She encountered her older self
and went into shock.

480
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,446
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

481
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,654
<i>Let's get her back to 1985.</i>

482
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,362
Then I'll destroy the time machine.

483
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:42,780
Destroy it?

484
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:46,196
<i>What about that stuff</i>
<i>about humanity and where we're going?</i>

485
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,862
The risks are too great,
as this incident proves.

486
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:50,779
And I was behaving responsibly.

487
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:54,112
Imagine if the time machine
fell into the wrong hands?

488
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:58,112
My only regret...

489
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:02,071
<i>...is that I'll never get a chance</i>
<i>to visit my favorite historical era...</i>

490
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:03,695
<i>...the Old West.</i>

491
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:06,944
But time traveling is just too dangerous.

492
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,612
Better that I devote myself to study...

493
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,028
...the other great mystery of the universe:

494
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,236
Women.

495
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:22,694
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves
for temporal displacement.

496
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:34,693
Did we make it?

497
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,277
Are we back?

498
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:48,069
We're back.

499
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:13,150
Let's put her in the swing.
You can return in your truck and wake her.

500
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:16,150
When she awakens here
in her own house...

501
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:19,067
...you can convince her it was a dream.

502
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,025
We're just leaving her here?

503
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,983
Disorientation will help convince her
it was a dream.

504
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,108
How long will she be out?

505
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,650
I'm not quite sure.
She received quite a shock.

506
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:32,942
<i>Could be a few minutes,</i>
<i>probably a couple of hours.</i>

507
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:36,608
- You better bring smelling salts.
- You're the doc, Doc.

508
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,524
Come on. Let's go, Einie.

509
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:42,524
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

510
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,399
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

511
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:06,106
If you need me,
I'll be in my lab dismantling this thing.

512
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,357
Right.

513
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,272
What the hell?

514
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,896
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in my room?

515
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,563
- Rape! Mom!
- Okay. Okay.

516
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:53,271
- Dad, help!
- Freeze, sucker!

517
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:56,938
- I don't want any trouble.
- You got trouble now, you piece of trash.

518
00:40:58,146 --> 00:41:01,354
- What are you doing here?
- I'm in the wrong house.

519
00:41:01,437 --> 00:41:03,562
You got that right, you son of a...

520
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:07,229
- Look. I made a mistake.
- Damned right you made a mistake!

521
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,937
I'm going to tear your ass up!

522
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:15,978
That's right. You keep running, sucker!
Tell that realty company that I ain't selling!

523
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:17,937
We won't be terrorized!

524
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,393
This has got to be the wrong year.

525
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:22,309
1985?

526
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,059
- It can't be.
- Drop it.

527
00:42:29,642 --> 00:42:32,683
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my papers.

528
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,059
Mr. Strickland.

529
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:38,475
- Mr. Strickland. It's me, sir. Marty.
- Who?

530
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:40,850
Martin McFly.
Don't you know me from school?

531
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:44,225
I've never seen you before in my life,
but you look like a slacker.

532
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,475
Yeah, that's right. I am a slacker.

533
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:51,392
- You gave me detention last week.
- The school burned down six years ago.

534
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:54,808
You have three seconds to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

535
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,974
- One.
- I just want to know what's going on.

536
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:58,974
Two.

537
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:01,724
Strickland!

538
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,015
Yeah!

539
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:21,681
Eat lead, slackers!

540
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:32,806
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

541
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:34,181
Red.

542
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:34,804

No!

569
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,716
- No!
- Come with us upstairs.

570
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,091
- Let me go.
- We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

571
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:07,716
<i>The easy way.</i>

572
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:22,841
- Mom? Mom, is that you?
- Just relax, Marty.

573
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:26,091
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

574
00:46:29,757 --> 00:46:32,340
I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible.

575
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:38,423
Well, you're safe and sound now,
back on the good old 27th floor.

576
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:40,548
27th floor!

577
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:49,506
Mom? Mom, that can't be you.

578
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:52,840
Well, yes, it's me, Marty. Are you all right?

579
00:46:53,256 --> 00:46:56,797
I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's just that you're so... You're so...

580
00:46:58,131 --> 00:46:59,047
...big.

581
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:02,214
Everything's going to be fine, Marty.
Are you hungry?

582
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:04,214
I can call room service.

583
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:07,297
Room service?

584
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,089
- <i>Lorraine!</i>
- Oh, my God. It's your father.

585
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,380
My father?

586
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:16,880
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you son of a bitch!

587
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,004
My father!

588
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,547
You got kicked out of another boarding school?

589
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,671
Do you know how much dough
I've blown on your no-good kids?

590
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:28,671
What the hell do you care? We can afford it.

591
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:32,963
The least we can do with that money
is provide a better life for our children.

592
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:35,671
Hold on. Let's get this straight.

593
00:47:35,754 --> 00:47:37,712
Marty is your kid, not mine.

594
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:40,878
All the world's money
wouldn't help that lazy bum.

595
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:42,754
Stop it, Biff. Just stop it.

596
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:44,379
Look at him.

597
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:47,045
He's a butthead, just like his old man was.

598
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:53,420
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

599
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:57,045
You're not even half the man he was.

600
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:00,962
You son of a bitch!

601
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:07,378
Always the little hothead?

602
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:15,961
<i>You want to take a poke at me?</i>

603
00:48:19,377 --> 00:48:22,752
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

604
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:26,168
So go ahead. Think about this, Lorraine!

605
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:30,085
Who's going to pay for your clothes?
And your jewelry and liquor?

606
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,835
Who's going to pay for your cosmetic surgery?

607
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:36,710
You were the one
who wanted me to get these things.

608
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:39,626
If you want them back, you can have them.

609
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,292
Look, Lorraine.

610
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:45,584
You leave and I won't only cut off you,
I'll cut off your kids.

611
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:48,543
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

612
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:51,834
First your daughter Linda.
I'll cancel all her credit cards.

613
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,459
She'll settle her debts with the bank herself.

614
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:57,459
I'll have your idiot son Dave's probation revoked.

615
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:58,917
And as for Marty...

616
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:02,709
...maybe you'd like to have
all of your kids behind bars...

617
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,333
...just like your brother Joey.

618
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,166
One big happy jailbird family.

619
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:13,792
All right, Biff. You win. I'll stay.

620
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:21,458
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

621
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:35,493
He was right, and I was wrong.

622
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,951
Mom!

623
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,576
Mom, what're you saying?
You're actually defending him.

624
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:44,076
I had it coming.

625
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,243
He's my husband,
and he takes care of all of us...

626
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,576
- ...and he deserves our respect.
- Respect?

627
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:55,284
Your husband!
How could he be your husband?

628
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,159
- How could you leave Dad for him?
- Leave Dad?

629
00:49:59,242 --> 00:50:03,783
- Marty, are you feeling all right?
- No, I'm not feeling all right!

630
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,575
I don't understand what's going on here.

631
00:50:06,658 --> 00:50:09,284
Why nobody can give me a simple,
straight answer.

632
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:12,575
They must have hit you over the head
hard this time.

633
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,075
Mom, I just want to know one thing.

634
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:18,950
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

635
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:21,158
Marty.

636
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:27,074
George, your father, is in the same place
he's been for the past 12 years.

637
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:31,241
Oak Park Cemetery.

638
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:58,490
No.

639
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:04,031
No! This can't be happening!

640
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,573
"March 15, 1973."

641
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,656
No! Please, God, no!

642
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:14,406
<i>No, please, God. Please, God, no.</i>

643
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,947
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

644
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,822
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

645
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:20,822
<i>This can't be...</i>

646
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:23,655
I'm afraid it is happening. All of it.

647
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,280
Doc!

648
00:51:25,363 --> 00:51:28,655
When I learned about your father,
I figured you'd come here.

649
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:32,988
Then you know
what happened to him?

650
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,696
Do you know what happened...

651
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:40,696
...March 15, 1973?

652
00:51:42,738 --> 00:51:44,072
Yes, Marty. I know.

653
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:48,362
I went to the public library
to make sense of the madness.

654
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:52,154
<i>The place was boarded up.</i>
<i>I broke in and borrowed newspapers.</i>

655
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,488
I don't get it, Doc.

656
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:57,112
How can all this be happening?
It's like we're in Hell or something.

657
00:51:57,196 --> 00:52:01,279
No, it's Hill Valley, although
I can't imagine Hell being much worse.

658
00:52:02,237 --> 00:52:04,945
Einie. I'm sorry, boy.

659
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:09,112
The lab is an awful, awful mess.

660
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,737
Attaboy.

661
00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:15,695
Obviously,
the time continuum has been disrupted...

662
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:18,362
...creating this new
temporal event sequence...

663
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:21,278
- ...resulting in this alternate reality.
- English, Doc.

664
00:52:21,362 --> 00:52:23,652
Here, here, here. Let me illustrate.

665
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:32,277
Imagine that this line represents time.

666
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:36,694
Here's the present, 1985,
the future, and the past.

667
00:52:39,027 --> 00:52:42,194
Prior to this point in time,
somewhere in the past...

668
00:52:42,277 --> 00:52:44,611
...the time line skewed into this tangent...

669
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,486
...creating an alternate 1985.

670
00:52:47,777 --> 00:52:51,610
Alternate to you, me, and Einstein...

671
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:55,110
...but reality for everyone else.

672
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:00,818
Recognize this?

673
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:03,568
It's the bag the sports book came in.

674
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:06,401
I know, because the receipt
was still inside.

675
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:10,401
I found them in the time machine,
along with this.

676
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,692
It's the top of Biff's cane.
I mean old Biff, from the future.

677
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:24,067
Correct. It was in the time machine
because Biff was in the time machine...

678
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,067
...with the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

679
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:27,858
Holy shit.

680
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:30,858
You see, while we were in the future...

681
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:35,067
...Biff got the sports book, stole
the time machine, went back in time...

682
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,316
...and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

683
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:42,650
Look. It says right here...

684
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:48,024
<i>...that Biff made his first $1,000,000</i>
<i>betting on a horserace in 1958.</i>

685
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:50,149
He wasn't just lucky.

686
00:53:50,232 --> 00:53:53,483
He knew, because he had
the race results in the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

687
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:55,982
That's how he made his entire fortune.

688
00:53:57,316 --> 00:53:59,690
Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.

689
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,815
The <i>Almanac</i>.

690
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,523
Son of a bitch stole my idea.

691
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:10,023
He must have been listening when I...

692
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:12,856
It's my fault.

693
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:17,023
The whole thing is my fault.
If I hadn't bought that damn book...

694
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:19,148
...none of this would have happened.

695
00:54:19,232 --> 00:54:21,148
- It's all in the past.
- The future.

696
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:25,814
Whatever. It demonstrates precisely
how time travel can be misused...

697
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:28,856
...and why the time machine
must be destroyed...

698
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:31,439
...after we straighten all of this out.

699
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,689
Right. So we go back to the future...

700
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:36,397
...and we stop Biff
from stealing the time machine.

701
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:41,272
We can't, because if we travel
into the future from this point in time...

702
00:54:41,356 --> 00:54:44,939
...it will be the future of this reality...

703
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,064
...in which Biff is corrupt and powerful...

704
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:51,688
...and married to your mother,
and in which...

705
00:54:53,605 --> 00:54:55,855
...this has happened to me.

706
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:05,979
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past...

707
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,646
...at the point where the time line
skewed into this tangent.

708
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,896
In order to put the universe back
as we remember it...

709
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:18,854
...and get back to our reality,
we have to find out the exact date...

710
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:22,604
...and the specific circumstances
of how, where, and when...

711
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:26,354
...young Biff got his hands
on that <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

712
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:29,728
I'll ask him.

713
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:58,186
Bulletproof vest! Great flick!
Great frigging flick!

714
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:00,061
<i>The guy is brilliant.</i>

715
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:02,268
What the hell's going...

716
00:56:02,352 --> 00:56:06,727
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- Party's over, Biff.

717
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:09,185
Sorry, ladies.

718
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:11,851
How did you get past my security downstairs?

719
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:14,768
There's a matter we need to talk about.

720
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:18,893
- Yeah. Money, right? Well, forget it.
- No. Not money.

721
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:24,518
<i>Gray's Sports Almanac.</i>

722
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:29,476
You heard him, girls.

723
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,434
Party's over.

724
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,642
Start talking, kid.
What else do you know about that book?

725
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,226
First you tell me how you got it.

726
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:44,517
How, where, and when.

727
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:49,225
All right. Take a seat.

728
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:54,558
Sit down!

729
00:56:58,766 --> 00:57:01,557
November 12, 1955. That was when.

730
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:04,766
November 12, 1955.
That was the date I went back...

731
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,891
That was the date
of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.

732
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:13,849
You know your history. Very good.

733
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,682
I'll never forget that Saturday.

734
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:20,973
<i>I'd picked my car up from the shop</i>
<i>because I'd rolled it in a drag race.</i>

735
00:57:21,807 --> 00:57:24,432
I thought you crashed into a manure truck.

736
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,515
How do you know about that?

737
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:30,182
My father told me about it.

738
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,057
Your father?

739
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:34,348
Before he died.

740
00:57:35,807 --> 00:57:37,306
Yeah. Right.

741
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,972
So there I was, minding my own business.

742
00:57:41,473 --> 00:57:43,847
<i>This crazy old codger with a cane shows up.</i>

743
00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:48,514
He says he's my distant relative.
I don't see any resemblance.

744
00:57:50,597 --> 00:57:53,014
<i>So he says, "How would you like to be rich?"</i>

745
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,847
So I said, "Sure."

746
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,681
<i>So he lays this book on me.</i>

747
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:07,430
<i>He says this book will tell me the</i>
<i>outcome of every sporting event this century.</i>

748
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:10,680
All I have to do is bet on the winner
and I'll never lose.

749
00:58:14,263 --> 00:58:18,971
So I said, "What's the catch?"
He says, "No catch. Just keep it a secret."

750
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:24,638
<i>After that, he disappeared.</i>

751
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:27,012
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

752
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,345
<i>He told me one more thing.</i>

753
00:58:42,012 --> 00:58:44,470
He said, "Someday a crazy,
wild-eyed scientist...

754
00:58:44,553 --> 00:58:47,095
<i>"...or a kid may show up</i>
<i>asking about that book.</i>

755
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:50,053
And if that ever happens..."

756
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:59,178
Funny. I never thought it would be you.

757
00:58:59,678 --> 00:59:03,135
Biff, you're forgetting one thing.
What the hell is that?

758
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:11,261
You're dead, you little son of a bitch!

759
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:26,718
- There he is!
- Wait, kid!

760
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:39,968
Hurry! There he is!

761
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,591
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

762
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,174
<i>A suicide will be nice and neat.</i>

763
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:16,716
What if I don't?

764
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,341
Lead poisoning.

765
01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:21,132
What about the police, Biff?

766
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:23,924
They're going to match the bullet with that gun.

767
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:26,590
Kid, I own the police.

768
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:32,340
Besides, they couldn't match up
the bullet that killed your old man.

769
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:34,882
You son of a...

770
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,965
I suppose it's poetic justice.

771
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:43,840
Two McFlys with the same gun.

772
01:00:55,506 --> 01:00:56,798
Idiot.

773
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:03,422
What the hell...

774
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,381
Nice job, Doc!

775
01:01:10,672 --> 01:01:14,297
You're not going to believe this.
We've got to go back to 1955.

776
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:15,755
I don't believe it.

777
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:30,255
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

778
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,505
Unbelievable that old Biff
could've chosen that particular date.

779
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:37,338
It could mean that that point in time
contains some cosmic significance...

780
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,462
...as if it were the temporal junction point
of the entire space-time continuum...

781
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:44,254
...or it could just be
an amazing coincidence.

782
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:51,837
Damn! Got to fix that thing.
All right. Time circuits on.

783
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:56,628
What do you mean, time circuits on?
Doc, we're not going back now.

784
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:00,711
What about Jennifer? What about Einstein?
We can't leave them.

785
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:03,336
Don't worry.
Assuming we succeed on our mission...

786
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,503
...this alternate 1985
will be changed into the real 1985...

787
01:02:06,586 --> 01:02:09,670
...instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

788
01:02:09,753 --> 01:02:11,586
<i>Jennifer and Einie will be fine.</i>

789
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,420
<i>They'll have no memory</i>
<i>of this horrible place.</i>

790
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:15,503
Doc.

791
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:20,378
- What if we don't succeed?
- We must succeed.

792
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,460
This is heavy, Doc.

793
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,335
It's like I was here yesterday.

794
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:41,460
You were here yesterday, Marty.
Amazing, isn't it?

795
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:44,377
Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes.

796
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:48,293
You go into town.
Track down young Biff and tail him.

797
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:52,251
Sometime today, old Biff will show up
to give young Biff the <i>Almanac</i>.

798
01:02:52,418 --> 01:02:54,501
Above all you must not interfere.

799
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:57,584
Let old Biff believe he's succeeded
so he'll leave 1955...

800
01:02:57,668 --> 01:03:00,000
- ...and bring the DeLorean to the future.
- Right.

801
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:03,167
Once old Biff is gone,
grab the <i>Almanac</i> anyway that you can.

802
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:07,334
- Remember, our futures depend on this.
- You don't have to remind me of that.

803
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:11,792
Here's some binoculars
and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact.

804
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:15,084
<i>I'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit.</i>

805
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,333
That way, we don't risk anyone else
stealing the time machine...

806
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:22,542
...and I won't risk
accidentally running into my other self.

807
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:25,833
- Other self?
- Yes. There are now two of me here...

808
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,791
...and there are two of you here.

809
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:31,791
The other me is
the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955.

810
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:36,749
<i>The other me that helps</i>
<i>the other you get back to 1985.</i>

811
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:41,833
Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?
That doesn't happen until tonight.

812
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:45,749
Be careful not to run into your other self.
Let me give you some money.

813
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:51,999
Have to be prepared
for all monetary possibilities.

814
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,456
- Get yourself some '50s clothes.
- Check, Doc.

815
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,249
Something inconspicuous.

816
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:02,082
Doc. Come in. This is Marty. Over.

817
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,123
- <i>Roger, this is Doc. Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, Doc. I'm at the address.

818
01:04:08,164 --> 01:04:11,831
<i>It's the only Tannen in the book,</i>
<i>but I don't think this is Biff's house.</i>

819
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,706
<i>It looks like an old lady lives here.</i>

820
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,290
- Biff!
- Yeah.

821
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:20,081
- Where are you going, Biff?
- I'm going to get my car, Grandma.

822
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:23,497
When are you coming back?
I want you to rub my toes.

823
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,706
Shut up, you old bag.

824
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:27,789
Give us our ball back.

825
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:30,205
- What ball?
- That ball!

826
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:31,871
What are you talking about?

827
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:34,205
Give us our ball!

828
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:35,746
Ball?

829
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,122
- Is this your ball?
- Yeah!

830
01:04:38,205 --> 01:04:39,830
- You want it back?
- Yeah.

831
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:43,997
Go get it.

832
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:52,162
Doc, it is Biff's house. I'm on him. Over.

833
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:08,453
She's all fixed up,
but I couldn't get her started.

834
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:12,120
- Got a kill switch?
- You just need the right touch.

835
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:14,620
Nobody can start this car but me.

836
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:17,537
- The bill comes to $302.57.
- $300?

837
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,245
$300 for a couple of dents? That's bullshit.

838
01:05:20,328 --> 01:05:22,744
It was horseshit.
The whole car was horseshit.

839
01:05:22,828 --> 01:05:25,995
- Jones wanted $80 to haul it away.
- I bet he resold it.

840
01:05:26,078 --> 01:05:29,078
- I got to get something.
- You want something?

841
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:32,078
You can call Jones and
if he wants to give you a refund--

842
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:36,953
$300! If I catch the guy
that caused this I'll break his neck.

843
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:40,452
The manure. I remember that.

844
01:05:46,827 --> 01:05:48,244
4 cans of Valvoline.

845
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:52,160
- 4 cans for a $300 job?
- I can't have lunch in there.

846
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:55,285
- Makes me nauseous.
- I should get a case for $300.

847
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,702
It smells worse than the bathroom.

848
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:01,243
<i>The stench is never going to go away, Biff.</i>

849
01:06:01,326 --> 01:06:03,743
<i>Last time I do you a favor. Last time.</i>

850
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:14,951
It's perfect, Lorraine.
You're going to look so good!

851
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:21,409
You're going to look--

852
01:06:21,492 --> 01:06:24,284
Look at what we have here.
Nice dress, Lorraine.

853
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:26,950
Although I think you'd look better
wearing nothing.

854
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:31,992
- Take a long walk off a short pier.
- There's that dance at school tonight.

855
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,533
<i>Now that my car's fixed...</i>

856
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:37,366
...I'll give you the honor of going
with the best-looking guy in school.

857
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:38,449
I'm busy.

858
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:40,159
- Doing what?
- Washing my hair.

859
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:42,783
That's as funny
as a screen door on a battleship.

860
01:06:42,992 --> 01:06:45,283
Screen door on a submarine, you dork.

861
01:06:45,408 --> 01:06:47,949
Biff, somebody already asked me
to the dance.

862
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:50,366
Who? That bug George McFly?

863
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,615
- I'm going with Calvin Klein, okay?
- Calvin Klein? No, it's not okay.

864
01:06:56,324 --> 01:06:59,574
- You're going with me, understand?
- Get your cooties off me!

865
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:03,199
When will you get it through your skull?
You're my girl.

866
01:07:04,032 --> 01:07:07,532
I wouldn't be your girl
even if you had a million dollars!

867
01:07:11,282 --> 01:07:14,449
Yes, you will! It's you and me, Lorraine.

868
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:15,781
Watch it!

869
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,449
It's meant to be.

870
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:22,031
I'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine.
Someday you'll be my wife!

871
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,364
You always did have a way with women.

872
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:29,781
Get the hell out of my car, old man.

873
01:07:29,865 --> 01:07:32,947
You want to marry that girl?
I can help make it happen.

874
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:36,947
- Who are you, Miss Lonely-hearts?
- Just get in the car, butthead.

875
01:07:38,072 --> 01:07:40,239
Who are you calling butthead, butthead?

876
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:43,822
How did you do that?
Nobody can start this car but me.

877
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:48,530
Get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

878
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,029
Watch where you're driving, old man.

879
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,363
<i>If you dent this car, I'll kill you.</i>

880
01:08:03,405 --> 01:08:07,612
- This cost me $300!
- Would you shut up about the car?

881
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:11,446
- How do you know where I live?
- Let's just say we're related, Biff.

882
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:14,362
That being the case, I got a present for you.

883
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:16,320
Something that'll make you rich.

884
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:20,862
- You want to be rich, don't you?
- Yeah. Sure. Right. That's rich.

885
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:22,778
You're going to make me rich?

886
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:26,446
You see this book?
This book tells the future.

887
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:30,404
Tells the results of every major sports event
till the end of this century.

888
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:34,361
Football, baseball, horseraces, boxing.

889
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:39,111
The information in here is worth millions,
and I'm giving it to you.

890
01:08:39,278 --> 01:08:41,528
That's very nice. Thank you very much.

891
01:08:41,778 --> 01:08:45,611
Now, why don't you make like a tree
and get out of here?

892
01:08:46,653 --> 01:08:50,320
It's leave, you idiot. Make like a tree and leave.

893
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:52,777
You sound like a fool when you say it wrong.

894
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,569
All right, leave. And take your book with you.

895
01:08:56,652 --> 01:09:00,152
Don't you get it?
You could make a fortune with this book.

896
01:09:00,485 --> 01:09:01,736
Let me show you.

897
01:09:06,152 --> 01:09:08,860
<i>UCLA trails 17-16.</i>

898
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:12,402
<i>It's 4th and 11</i>
<i>with only 18 seconds left of this game.</i>

899
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:14,901
<i>I'd say it's all over for UCLA.</i>

900
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,235
Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17.

901
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:23,943
- What are you, deaf? It's over. You lost.
- Yeah?

902
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:27,901
<i>Here comes Decker with the kick.</i>
<i>It's up and looks good.</i>

903
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:32,276
<i>Ball's in the clear.</i>
<i>Field goal! UCLA wins 19-17.</i>

904
01:09:32,693 --> 01:09:36,443
<i>Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild.</i>
<i>Jim Decker...</i>

905
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:40,026
All right. What's the gag?
How did you know what the score would be?

906
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,192
I told you, it's in this book.

907
01:09:42,317 --> 01:09:45,609
All you got to do is bet on the winner,
and you'll never lose.

908
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,233
All right. I'll take a look at it.

909
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,025
You damn fool!

910
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:01,358
Never leave this book laying around.

911
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:04,357
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

912
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:10,149
Get a safe. Keep it locked up.
Until then, keep it on you.

913
01:10:10,232 --> 01:10:13,482
- What are you doing?
- Don't tell anybody, either.

914
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:18,566
There's one more thing.
One day, a kid or a crazy old man...

915
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:22,316
<i>...who claims to be a scientist</i>
<i>is going to come around asking...</i>

916
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:49,647
I'm trapped. Doc.

917
01:10:49,856 --> 01:10:51,064
<i>Doc, come in.</i>

918
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:52,939
- What's the report?
- <i>Biff's gone.</i>

919
01:10:54,106 --> 01:10:56,689
He's got the book.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

920
01:10:57,314 --> 01:10:58,939
<i>Get me the hell out of here.</i>

921
01:10:59,731 --> 01:11:01,147
I'm at 1809 Mason Street.

922
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:05,272
I can't take the DeLorean.
Don't worry. Somehow I'll get there.

923
01:11:05,355 --> 01:11:08,688
Doc, wait a minute. Doc. Doc.

924
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:11,563
Perfect.

925
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,313
Biff! Where are you going now?

926
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:21,062
I told you, Grandma,
I'm going to the dance.

927
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,521
- When you coming home?
- The dance.

928
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:25,354
I'll get home when I get home.

929
01:11:27,646 --> 01:11:30,521
Don't forget to turn out
the garage light.

930
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:04,020
Marty. Marty!

931
01:12:04,728 --> 01:12:05,644
<i>Marty.</i>

932
01:12:07,977 --> 01:12:10,436
Marty, Marty. Damn!

933
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:12,894
Where is that kid?

934
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,727
Doc. Doc, come in.

935
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:23,643
<i>Come in, Doc.</i>

936
01:12:24,518 --> 01:12:25,810
Marty! Come in.

937
01:12:26,226 --> 01:12:27,143
Doc.

938
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:32,143
Marty.

939
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:34,518
My...

940
01:12:36,684 --> 01:12:38,726
Great Scott.

941
01:12:54,309 --> 01:12:55,392
My God.

942
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:01,975
Doc, Doc, come in.

943
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:05,267
Marty, what happened?
You weren't at Biff's house.

944
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:09,349
I'm in Biff's car, heading for
the Enchantment Under The Sea dance.

945
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:14,141
We may have to abort this entire plan.
It's getting much too dangerous.

946
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:17,349
The book's on his dashboard.
I'll grab it when we arrive.

947
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:21,099
You must be careful
not to run into your other self.

948
01:13:21,183 --> 01:13:22,433
- <i>My other self?</i>
- Yes.

949
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:26,891
Remember your mother is
at that exact same dance with you.

950
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:30,932
- <i>Right. This could get heavy, Doc.</i>
- Heavy, heavy.

951
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:33,766
Whatever happens,
don't let your other self see you!

952
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:37,390
- The consequences could be disastrous.
- Excuse me, sir.

953
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:39,766
Yes, you with the hat.

954
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,682
- Who, me?
- Yes.

955
01:13:42,806 --> 01:13:46,057
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench
from the toolbox.

956
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:48,890
Five-eighths?

957
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,223
Don't you mean three-quarters?

958
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:56,057
Why, you're right.

959
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:01,348
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

960
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:06,389
That's right. How did you know that?

961
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:10,097
I happen to have had a little experience
in this area.

962
01:14:10,597 --> 01:14:13,431
I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight...

963
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:16,472
...although the weatherman says
there's no chance of rain.

964
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:19,764
There's going to be plenty of rain.
Wind, thunder, lightning.

965
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:24,472
- It's going to be one hell of a storm.
- Thanks. Nice talking to you.

966
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:27,764
Maybe we'll bump into each other again
in the future.

967
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:31,138
Or in the past.

968
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:14,053
Doc, Doc! Come in!

969
01:16:26,634 --> 01:16:30,008
Where's that punk Calvin Klein, anyway?

970
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:32,258
I don't know. I ain't his secretary.

971
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:35,217
Well, find him.
He caused me $300 damage.

972
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,841
I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going!

973
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:41,591
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm reading.

974
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:36,255
Well, well, Mr. Tannen.

975
01:17:37,506 --> 01:17:39,339
<i>How nice to see you here.</i>

976
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:43,963
- Why, Mr. Strickland, nice to see you, sir.
- Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?

977
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:45,755
I wouldn't know.

978
01:17:45,838 --> 01:17:48,963
I don't know what it smells like
because I'm too young to drink it.

979
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:50,088
I see.

980
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:52,588
What have we here?

981
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,505
Sports stats,
interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?

982
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:03,046
No, it ain't homework,
because, I ain't at home.

983
01:18:04,338 --> 01:18:07,171
You got a real attitude problem, you know?

984
01:18:07,254 --> 01:18:10,295
One day I'll have you where I want you,
in detention.

985
01:18:11,212 --> 01:18:12,253
Slacker!

986
01:18:24,878 --> 01:18:26,503
Jesus, you smoke, too?

987
01:18:26,586 --> 01:18:29,669
Marty,
you sound just like my mother.

988
01:18:29,753 --> 01:18:31,170
Yeah, right.

989
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:34,544
When I have kids,
I'll let them do anything they want.

990
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:36,044
<i>Anything at all.</i>

991
01:18:36,419 --> 01:18:39,127
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- Yeah, me, too.

992
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:41,794
Marty, why are you so nervous?

993
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,372
Yes!

994
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,288
No!

995
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:57,622
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

996
01:20:58,205 --> 01:20:59,580
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

997
01:21:01,871 --> 01:21:03,288
<i>"Oh LL"?</i>

998
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:11,621
- Doc! Doc!
- Hey, you.

999
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:14,621
- Doc, come in!
- <i>Marty, what's up?</i>

1000
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,371
Doc! I'm in trouble. I blew it.

1001
01:21:17,454 --> 01:21:19,829
- Where's the book?
- <i>Biff must have it.</i>

1002
01:21:19,912 --> 01:21:22,496
- I've only got the cover.
- <i>Where's Biff?</i>

1003
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:24,621
- <i>You're asking for it.</i>
- I don't know.

1004
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:28,537
- <i>Any idea?</i>
- No! He could be anywhere by now.

1005
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,246
The entire future depends on you
getting that book!

1006
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:35,037
- I know. I just don't--
- Stop it!

1007
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:38,995
<i>Stop it, Biff. You'll break his arm. Stop it!</i>

1008
01:21:42,787 --> 01:21:43,869
Of course!

1009
01:21:44,869 --> 01:21:48,994
I gotta go. I got one chance!
My old man is about to deck Biff!

1010
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:57,327
Yes!

1011
01:22:10,952 --> 01:22:12,868
Talk about dj vu.

1012
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:14,827
Are you okay?

1013
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:36,284
Okay, everybody, let's back up.

1014
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:40,408
Everybody just back up.
Give him a little bit of room.

1015
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:42,867
It's okay. I know CPR.

1016
01:22:43,118 --> 01:22:44,784
I know CPR.

1017
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,909
- What's CPR?
- You!

1018
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:54,575
- He's fine.
- Did you just take his wallet?

1019
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:56,450
He took that guy's wallet.

1020
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,950
<i>Doc, success. I got it.</i>

1021
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:01,283
Thank goodness.

1022
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:03,533
Great, Marty.

1023
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:08,491
As soon as I reload the fusion generator
we'll meet on the roof of the school gym.

1024
01:23:08,574 --> 01:23:09,908
On the roof. 10-4.

1025
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:12,950
- It's him!
- He's in disguise.

1026
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,825
Guys, what's that?

1027
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:18,408
Come on! Let's get him!

1028
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,657
Damn!

1029
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:08,280
All right! Let's do another.

1030
01:24:08,364 --> 01:24:11,239
Where did he go?
He just came in here!

1031
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:18,238
- Look! How did he get on stage?
- When he's through, we'll nail him.

1032
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:20,697
How did he change his clothes so fast?

1033
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,196
<i>It's an oldie</i>
<i>where I come from.</i>

1034
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:25,613
<i>All right, guys, blues riff in B.</i>

1035
01:24:25,697 --> 01:24:29,029
<i>Watch me for the changes,</i>
<i>and try and keep up, okay?</i>

1036
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,154
<i>Doc, come in!</i>

1037
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,113
Come in.

1038
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:41,612
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into the gym.
They're going to jump "me."

1039
01:24:41,696 --> 01:24:43,112
Get out of there!

1040
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:47,570
No, not me. The other me.
The one on stage playing <i>Johnny B. Goode</i>.

1041
01:24:48,612 --> 01:24:52,570
He could miss his opportunity to return!
We'll have a major paradox!

1042
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:54,153
Wait. A paradox?

1043
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:57,070
One of those things
that could destroy the universe?

1044
01:24:57,945 --> 01:25:02,361
You have to stop those guys
without being seen by your other self.

1045
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:03,611
10-4.

1046
01:25:04,987 --> 01:25:06,444
What the hell?

1047
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:11,528
- Where is he?
- Who?

1048
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:13,069
- Calvin Klein.
- Who?

1049
01:25:13,236 --> 01:25:15,902
- With the hat, where is he?
- He went that way.

1050
01:25:16,735 --> 01:25:18,819
I think he took your wallet.

1051
01:25:19,111 --> 01:25:20,777
I think he took his wallet.

1052
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,438
<i>I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet...</i>

1053
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:23,147
<i>...but your kids are going to love it.</i>

1054
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,646
Doc, success. Everything's cool.

1055
01:27:33,938 --> 01:27:37,063
<i>Great. I'll be landing</i>
<i>at the roof in one minute.</i>

1056
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:38,521
I'll be there.

1057
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:47,396
Lorraine.

1058
01:27:47,646 --> 01:27:51,521
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1059
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,437
I hope you don't mind.
George asked to take me home.

1060
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,854
Yeah. Great. Great.
I had a feeling about you two.

1061
01:28:01,937 --> 01:28:03,520
I had a feeling, too.

1062
01:28:04,353 --> 01:28:05,728
Butthead!

1063
01:28:06,937 --> 01:28:09,895
You think that stupid disguise can get by me?

1064
01:28:10,645 --> 01:28:12,186
Let's have it out.

1065
01:28:12,437 --> 01:28:15,061
You and me, right now.

1066
01:28:15,728 --> 01:28:17,145
No, thanks.

1067
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,561
What's the matter?

1068
01:28:21,186 --> 01:28:22,853
Where are you going?

1069
01:28:23,353 --> 01:28:24,894
Are you chicken?

1070
01:28:26,394 --> 01:28:27,853
That's it, isn't it?

1071
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,936
Nothing but a little chicken.

1072
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,727
Nobody calls me a--

1073
01:28:56,059 --> 01:28:57,351
What the hell...

1074
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:01,393
You steal my stuff?

1075
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:05,268
And this one's for my car!

1076
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,474
Doc! I blew it.

1077
01:29:34,933 --> 01:29:38,433
Biff nailed me. He took the book.
He drove away with it in his car.

1078
01:29:38,516 --> 01:29:40,641
It's my fault. I should have left sooner.

1079
01:29:40,725 --> 01:29:43,725
- No time for that. Where did he go?
- To the River Road Tunnel.

1080
01:29:43,808 --> 01:29:44,766
Get in!

1081
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:57,390
Yes!

1082
01:29:57,849 --> 01:29:59,640
There he is, Doc!

1083
01:29:59,724 --> 01:30:03,682
- Let's land on him and cripple his car.
- That's a '46 Ford. We're a DeLorean.

1084
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:05,682
He'll rip us like tin foil.

1085
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:08,390
- So what do we do?
- I have a plan.

1086
01:30:08,473 --> 01:30:13,723
<i>Repeating tonight's weather bulletin,</i>

<i>...at the community center on Forest Road.</i>

1092
01:30:57,846 --> 01:31:01,679
<i>For you sports fans,</i>
<i>there was much action today in college football.</i>

1093
01:31:01,762 --> 01:31:03,846

- <i>Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0.</i>
- Shit.

1098
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:19,761
- <i>It was Notre Dame over North Carolina...</i>
- Son of a bitch.

1099
01:31:19,845 --> 01:31:22,761
<i>Oklahoma ripped Iowa State 52-0.</i>

1100

1105

You again?

1106
01:31:42,927 --> 01:31:44,094
God!

1107
01:31:45,386 --> 01:31:46,760
Let it go!

1108
01:31:53,969 --> 01:31:55,510
Let go of this car!

1109
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:31,176
That'll teach him.

1110
01:34:05,464 --> 01:34:07,213
Go, Doc!

1111
01:34:07,297 --> 01:34:08,838
Hold on, Marty!

1112
01:34:14,296 --> 01:34:15,463
Shit!

1113
01:34:22,171 --> 01:34:23,296
Yes!

1114
01:34:33,378 --> 01:34:36,670
Manure! I hate manure!

1115
01:35:00,669 --> 01:35:03,210
Doc, is everything all right? Over.

1116
01:35:03,377 --> 01:35:06,002
<i>It's very miserable flying weather...</i>

1117
01:35:06,085 --> 01:35:08,835
...much too turbulent
for a landing from this direction.

1118
01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:12,252
I'll have to approach from the south.
Have you got the book?

1119
01:35:12,918 --> 01:35:15,336
In my hand, Doc! I got it in my hand!

1120
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:16,960
Burn it!

1121
01:35:17,418 --> 01:35:18,543
Check!

1122
01:36:14,124 --> 01:36:17,124
Doc! Doc! The newspaper changed.

1123
01:36:17,207 --> 01:36:18,999
Doc, my father's alive!

1124
01:36:19,249 --> 01:36:21,749
<i>That means everything's back to normal, right?</i>

1125
01:36:25,498 --> 01:36:27,457
Mission accomplished.

1126
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:30,540
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

1127
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:33,498
That's right, Marty. It's the ripple effect.

1128
01:36:33,665 --> 01:36:35,874
The future is back, so let's go home.

1129
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,665
Right. Let's get our asses back to the--

1130
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:46,748
Doc, Doc, are you okay?

1131
01:36:46,956 --> 01:36:48,248
<i>That was a close one.</i>

1132
01:36:48,332 --> 01:36:50,290
I almost bought the farm.

1133
01:36:53,539 --> 01:36:56,998
Well, be careful.
You don't want to get struck by lightning.

1134
01:37:11,538 --> 01:37:12,663
Doc.

1135
01:37:21,622 --> 01:37:22,705
Doc?

1136
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:25,580
Doc, come in, Doc.

1137
01:37:27,246 --> 01:37:28,787
Doc, do you read me?

1138
01:37:30,038 --> 01:37:32,330
Do you read me, Doc? Come in.

1139
01:37:32,787 --> 01:37:33,746
Doc.

1140
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:47,370
No.

1141
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,329
He's gone.

1142
01:37:59,661 --> 01:38:01,162
<i>The Doc's gone.</i>

1143
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:25,827
Mr. McFly!

1144
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,410
Is your name Marty McFly?

1145
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:38,535
Yeah.

1146
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:43,243
I've got something for you.

1147
01:38:45,534 --> 01:38:46,701
A letter.

1148
01:38:48,242 --> 01:38:50,242
A letter for me?

1149
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:52,659
That's impossible.

1150
01:38:54,284 --> 01:38:56,867
- Who the hell are you?
- Western Union.

1151
01:38:57,326 --> 01:39:01,784
Many of us at the office were hoping
you could shed some light on the subject.

1152
01:39:02,201 --> 01:39:04,242
We've had that envelope in our possession...

1153
01:39:04,284 --> 01:39:06,992
...for the past 70 years.

1154
01:39:09,575 --> 01:39:12,575
It was given to us
with the explicit instructions...

1155
01:39:12,658 --> 01:39:16,742
<i>...that it be delivered</i>
<i>to a young man with your description...</i>

1156
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:21,283
...answering to the name of Marty
at this exact location...

1157
01:39:21,533 --> 01:39:25,574
...at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.

1158
01:39:25,991 --> 01:39:29,116
We had a bet going on whether this Marty
would actually be here.

1159
01:39:29,283 --> 01:39:30,741
Looks like I lost.

1160
01:39:31,949 --> 01:39:33,449
Did you say 70 years?

1161
01:39:33,532 --> 01:39:38,199
Yes. 70 years, 2 months, 12 days, to be exact.
Sign on line 6, please.

1162
01:39:38,282 --> 01:39:39,657
Here you are.

1163
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:52,698
It's from the Doc!

1164
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:59,032
Dear Marty,
if my calculations are correct...

1165
01:39:59,114 --> 01:40:03,698
<i>"...you will receive this letter immediately after</i>
<i>the DeLorean's struck by lightning.</i>

1166
01:40:03,782 --> 01:40:06,656
First let me assure you I'm alive and well.

1167
01:40:06,947 --> 01:40:10,323
I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885.

Wait, kid!
Wait a minute. What's this all about?

1172
01:40:19,822 --> 01:40:21,322
He's alive!

1173
01:40:21,572 --> 01:40:23,113
The Doc's alive!

1174
01:40:23,405 --> 01:40:27,530
- He's in the Old West, but he's alive.
- Kid, you all right?

1175
01:40:27,697 --> 01:40:29,155
Need any help?

1176
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:31,821
There's only one man who can help me.

1177
01:41:47,027 --> 01:41:48,735
Doc! Doc!

1178
01:41:49,526 --> 01:41:51,360
Doc! Doc!

1179
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,443
Relax, Doc. It's me. It's me! It's Marty.

1180
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,068
Impossible. I sent you back to the future.

1181
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,151
I know, you did send me back...

1182
01:42:00,443 --> 01:42:03,193
...but I'm back. I'm back from the future.

1183

Great Scott!

1184

Doc!

Doc.

1186

Doc.

1187
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:36,316
McFly.

1188
01:42:43,941 --> 01:42:45,982
That's right, Tannen!

1189
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:49,316
Come on, runt! You can dance better than that!
