2
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,213
You got a date with justice,
One-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,216
Too bad, Sheriff. I'm a married man.

4
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,424
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,021
I think you dropped something, mister.

6
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,860
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,441
You've reached the end of the line!

8
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,701
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,080
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,047
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

11
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,097
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,727
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

13
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,564
Hold him steady!

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,282
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,767
No!

16
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,486
Glad I could catch the train!

17
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,814
Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,445
To infinity and beyond!

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,093
Reach for the sky.

20
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,507
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

21
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,802
I brought my attack clog
with a built-in force field.

22
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,523
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

23
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,665
Evil Dr Pork Chop!

24
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,711
That's Mr Evil Dr Pork Chop to you.

25
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,180
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

26
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,098
"Woody, no. it'll kill you." "Just do it!"

27
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,728
"You're going to jail, Bart." "Watch out!"

28
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,939
Mom!

29
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,030
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I'm not here.

30
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,196
Oh, no, Molly!

31
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,993
No, it's okay, Mom.
it's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

32
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,787
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

33
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,078
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

34
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,452
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

35
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,332
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

36
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,091
Happy birthday!

37
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,004
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

38
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,272
"l came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

39
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,940
"Got it, Woody."

40
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,772
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

41
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,029
"Good work, Buzz."

42
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,971
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

43
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,268
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

44
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,937
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

45
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,812
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

46
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,151
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

47
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,527
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

48
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,445
Is it hot in here?

49
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,616
Here they come!

50
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,246
Sarge, you got it?

51
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,699
Mission accomplished.

52
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,953
Hooray!

53
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,207
Careful. Careful!

54
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,712
All right, guys. We got one shot at this.
Everyone ready?

55
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,589
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

56
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,841
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

57
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,027
Target is on approach.

58
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,400
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

59
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,046
Hello?

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,542
Hello ? Anyone there?

61
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,386
Molly, stay out of my room!

62
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,555
I wasn't in your room.

63
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,598
Then who was messing with my stuff?

64
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,051
It wasn't me.

65
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,729
Well, that went well.

66
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,779
He held me! He actually held me!

67
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,814
This is just sad.

68
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,320
Who we kiddin'?
The kid's 17 years old.

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,243
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

70
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,657
Guys, hey, hold up.

71
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,410
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

72
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,665
Not again!

73
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,877
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

74
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,253
We are gathered, Woody.

75
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,843
Okay. First off,

76
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,965
we all knew Operation Playtime
was a long shot.

77
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,466
More like a misfire.

78
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,561
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

79
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,764
Being there for Andy. We know.

80
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,349
But we can try again! Right?

81
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,770
I'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

82
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,070
What?

83
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,616
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

84
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,989
We're going into attic mode, folks.

85
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,945
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

86
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,033
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

87
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,665
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

88
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,463
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

89
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,631
Yeah, but now it's here.

90
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,051
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

91
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,469
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

92
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,180
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

93
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,308
- Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,178
We clone our duty. Andy's grown up.

95
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,514
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

96
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,270
we army guys are the first to go.

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,901
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

98
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,106
It has been an honour serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

99
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,237
You're gonna need it.

100
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,069
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

101
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,655
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

102
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,952
How do you know?

103
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,033
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

104
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,494
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

105
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,831
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!

106
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

107
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,837
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

108
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,174
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

109
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,851
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?

110
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,268
Yeah. Even Bo.

111
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,606
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

112
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,359
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

113
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,866
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

114
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,705
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

115
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,203
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

116
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,125
There's games up there,
and books, and...

117
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,205
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

118
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,666
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

119
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,879
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

120
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,384
Yeah.

121
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,138
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

122
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,766
And he'll play with us then, right?

123
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,563
We'll always be there for him.

124
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,892
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

125
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,444
and go out on a high note.

126
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,271
I'd better find my other eye.

127
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,356
Where'd you leave it this time?

128
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,534
Someplace dark. And dusty.

129
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,988
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

130
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,701
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

131
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,776
You guarantee it, huh?

132
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,901
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

133
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,658
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

134
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,036
For infinity and beyond.

135
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,949
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.

136
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,205
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm taking it with me.

137
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,382
- Can I have your computer?
- No.

138
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,756
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

139
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,553
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

140
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,265
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

141
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,311
- Mom, I'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

142
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,228
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

143
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,650
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

144
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,194
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

145
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,651
Why do you still have these toys?

146
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,782
Molly, out of my room!

147
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,530
Three more days and it's mine!

148
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,032
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

149
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,954
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

150
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,207
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

151
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,454
What kids?

152
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,332
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

153
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,754
What's daycare?

154
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,955
- Mom.
- No buts.

155
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,802
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

156
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,348
Poor Barbie.

157
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,682
I get the Corvette.

158
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,234
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

159
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,356
Like what?

160
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,312
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

161
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,319
- Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No.

162
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,615
Maybe sell them online?

163
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,568
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

164
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,615
They're junk.

165
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,413
Fine. You have till Friday.

166
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,162
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

167
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,245
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

168
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,681
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

169
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,849
That's what's happening.

170
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,237
- You need a hand?
- I got it.

171
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,693
Here.

172
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,528
So, you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

173
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,989
- If I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,907
Then, yes, I'll miss you.

175
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,792
I can't breathe!

176
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,165
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

177
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,347
Andy!

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,437
That's not trash. That's not trash!

179
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,685
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

180
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,063
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

181
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,695
Okay, boy. To the kerb!

182
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,489
No, Buster! No!

183
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,327
Get up. Buster!

184
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,391
- We're on the kerb!
- I knew it would come to this!

185
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,972
Pull, everyone! Pull!

186
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,405
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!

187
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,112
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

188
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,367
There's gotta be a way out!

189
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,040
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

190
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,704
Point. Point. Point!

191
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,792
Push! Push!

192
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,374
I can hear the garbage truck!

193
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,210
It's getting closer.

194
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,082
Buzz! Jessie!

195
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,343
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

196
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,179
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

197
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,099
This doesn't make any sense.

198
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,732
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

199
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,233
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

200
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,907
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

201
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,655
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

202
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,452
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

203
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,576
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

204
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,955
Fellas, I know what to do.

205
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,959
What the heck?

206
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,880
- We should've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

207
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,008
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

208
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,885
Now we need to go!

209
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,896
You're right. Come on.

210
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,269
- Buzz?
- Woody!

211
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,443
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

212
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,486
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

213
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,814
We're going to daycare!

214
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,524
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

215
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,493
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

216
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,913
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

217
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,831
Attic? So how did we
end up on the kerb?

218
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,576
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

219
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,832
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

220
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,504
And called us junk!

221
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,758
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

222
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,756
Sure thing, college boy!

223
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,675
Andy's moving on, Woody.

224
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,555
It's time we did the same.

225
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,009
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

226
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,016
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

227
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,349
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

228
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,698
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

229
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,495
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

230
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

231
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,545
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

232
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,888
Welcome to the club, toots.

233
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,305
Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get
back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

234
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,101
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

235
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,645
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

236
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,063
Andy doesn't want us any more.

237
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,441
He was putting you in the attic!

238
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,563
He left us on the kerb!

239
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,396
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

240
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,072
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

241
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,777
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place

242
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,033
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

243
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,792
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.

244
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,588
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

245
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,103
Can anyone see anything?

246
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,147
- There's a playground!
- Wow!

247
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,225
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

248
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,356
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

249
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,688
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

250
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,648
Perspective? This place is perfect.

251
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,827
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

252
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,290
- Hey there!
- Wow!

253
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,993
Haven't seen you in ages.

254
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,499
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

255
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,173
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

256
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,468
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

257
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,762
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

258
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,091
Not kids any more.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

259
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,766
- What?
- Can you believe it?

260
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,392
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

261
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,858
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

262
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,696
- Look!
- Wow!

263
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,402
What? What is it?

264
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,167
No, no, no.

265
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,328
What's the matter with you?

266
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,168
I can't see!

267
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

268
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,516
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

269
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,390
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

270
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,938
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

271
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,181
- I want to see!
- Hey!

272
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,390
- Rex!
- it's my turn!

273
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,568
New toys!

274
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,747
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

275
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,665
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

276
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,084
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

277
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,458
Thank you. May I?

278
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,921
The claw!

279
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,895
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

280
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,445
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.

281
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,031
But please call me Lotso.

282
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,982
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

283
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,074
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

284
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,033
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

285
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,788
It's been horrible.

286
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,871
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

287
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,458
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

288
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,841
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

289
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,514
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

290
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,928
Mr Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

291
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,646
All clay long. Five days a week.

292
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,644
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

293
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,521
Well, now, I'll tell ya.

294
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,854
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

295
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,406
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

296
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,453
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

297
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,957
No owners means no heartbreak.

298
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,003
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

299
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,500
Because we're Andy's toys!

300
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,584
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

301
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,590
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

302
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,797
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

303
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,184
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

304
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,637
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

305
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,936
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

306
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,568
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

307
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,068
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

308
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,538
Hi, I'm Ken.

309
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,747
Barbie. Have we ever met?

310
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,461
I would've remembered.

311
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,259
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

312
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,338
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

313
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,345
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

314
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:50,188
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

315
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,892
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

316
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,024
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

317
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,980
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

318
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,862
Spare parts, superglue,

319
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,366
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

320
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,697
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.

321
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,327
Well, stop your worryin'.

322
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,411
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

323
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,381
And this, well, this is where I live.

324
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,255
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

325
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,675
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

326
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,552
You have everything!

327
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,476
Everything except
someone to share it with.

328
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,812
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

329
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,863
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

330
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,024
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

331
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,953
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

332
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,247
Abandoned by the same owner.

333
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,208
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

334
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,583
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

335
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,756
We control our own destiny.

336
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,753
Watch out for puddles.

337
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,462
And here's where you folks'll be stayin'.

338
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,422
The Caterpillar Room.

339
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,721
- Look at this place.
- Wow!

340
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,802
Holy moly guacamole.

341
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,387
Jackpot, baby.

342
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,306
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

343
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,277
It's so beautiful!

345
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,612
What the... Hey, little guy.

346
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,069
How long's it been
since you all got played with?

347
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,199
It's been years.

348
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,499
Well, just you wait.
In a few minutes, that bell's gonna ring,

349
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,373
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

350
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,331
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

351
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,292
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

352
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,376
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

353
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,507
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

354
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,179
- Goodbye, Mr Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.

355
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,383
- Will I see you again?
- I'll see you tonight

356
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,968
in my dreams.

357
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,386
Ken, let's get a move on.

358
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,847
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

359
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,727
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Heck, you don't know me from G.I. Joe,

360
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,903
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

361
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,231
- Made for each other.
- ...made for each other.

362
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,029
- Yay!
- Yes.

363
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,985
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

364
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,035
This is so exciting!

365
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,879
Sounds like kids to me.

366
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,380
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

367
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,006
How many you reckon are out there?

368
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,838
They sound so sweet.

369
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,560
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

370
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,104
But we need to go home.

371
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,402
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

372
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,488
A chance to make kids happy again.

373
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,316
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

374
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,616
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

375
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,784
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

376
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,862
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

377
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,250
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

378
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,337
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

379
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,085
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

380
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,675
Now, I'm going home.

381
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,845
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

382
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,975
Buzz?

383
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,977
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

384
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,766
What?

385
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,898
And what's important now
is we stay together.

386
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,106
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

387
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,657
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

388
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,949
Whose name is written there?

389
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,247
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us any more.

390
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,121
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

391
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,872
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

392
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,828
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

393
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,041
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,962
Okay, fine. Perfect.

395
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,549
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

396
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,773
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

397
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,086
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

398
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,338
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

399
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,594
Look,

400
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,509
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

401
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,976
Bonnie?

402
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,898
Bonnie?

403
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,064
I gotta go.

404
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,232
Bonnie, you in here?

405
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,551
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

406
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,887
What... What the heck?

407
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,717
Now, that's better.

408
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,433
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...

409
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,516
There you are. Come on, honey.
it's time to go home.

410
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,503
No, no, no, no!

411
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,176
Reach for the sky!

412
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,548
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

413
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,473
You ?'e my favourite deputy.

414
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,854
- Bonnie!
- Coming!

415
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,818
Great.

416
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,877
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

417
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,747
Woody's going to college with Andy.
it's what he's always wanted.

418
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,425
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

419
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,173
Toys are for playtime.

420
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,255
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

421
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,306
- How many?
- There must be dozens.

422
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,599
I can hardly wait!

423
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,097
Places, everyone!

424
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,826
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

425
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,696
- Rex?
- Come to papa.

426
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,132
There 3 a snake in my boot.

427
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:29,474
I 'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.

428
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,596
A sheriff!

429
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,138
Move over, Mr Pricklepants.

430
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,895
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

431
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,939
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

432
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,073
Be right back!

433
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,114
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

434
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,828
Can you tell me where I am?

435
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,326
The guy's just asking a question.

436
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, excuse me.
I'm trying to stay in character.

437
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,042
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

438
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,589
Hello, I'm Trixie.

439
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,967
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

440
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,339
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

441
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,340
I'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

442
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,300
with life-changing news.

443
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,645
We do a lot of improv here.
Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

444
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,724
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?

445
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,567
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

446
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,775
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

447
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,369
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

448
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,459
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

449
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,498
"l know where to hide."

450
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,549
She'll never find us in here.

451
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,881
What's wrong?

452
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,685
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

453
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,559
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

454
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,265
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

455
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,725
There is no way out.

456
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,353
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

457
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,485
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.

458
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,861
- Woody.
- Woody?

459
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,658
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

460
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,362
'Cause now's your chance to change it,
new room and all.

461
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,072
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

462
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,746
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

463
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,998
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

464
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,297
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!

465
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,591
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!

466
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,005
Showtime.

467
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,553
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

468
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,224
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

469
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,598
Three, two, one, blastoff l

470
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,568
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

471
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,830
I got a kink in my slink.

472
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,826
My tail! Where's my tail?

473
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,588
Someone need a hand?

474
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,095
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

475
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,422
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

476
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,631
Honey, the moustache?

477
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,467
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

478
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,888
Andy never played with us like that.

479
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,847
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

480
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,724
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

481
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,152
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

482
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,820
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

483
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,488
- With the big kids!
- That's right.

484
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,531
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

485
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,326
I'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

486
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,702
Blast. Try that one.

487
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,958
It's locked!

488
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,044
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

489
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,047
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

490
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,841
Finest childproof lock in the world.

491
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,010
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

492
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,382
Did anyone notice the transom?

493
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,011
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

494
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,517
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

495
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,351
- Three!
- Whoa!

496
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,646
Let go!

497
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,576
Go!

498
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,291
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!

499
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,793
Way to go, Buzz!

500
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,178
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

501
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,345
They might hear you.

502
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,971
- Okay, now you start.
- I...

503
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,267
- Love...
- You.

504
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,687
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

505
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,810
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...

506
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,061
- Love...
- You.

507
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,142
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

508
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,898
You are so smart.

509
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,604
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

510
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,989
- I'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!

511
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,338
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

512
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,638
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.

513
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,761
- All right.
- Here we go.

514
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,843
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

515
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,473
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.

516
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,600
Come on, duck.

517
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,522
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.

518
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,691
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

519
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,313
Here is a duck.

520
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,524
- I won!
- Ah, man!

521
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,820
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

522
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,525
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

523
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,160
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.

524
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,737
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.

525
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,948
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

526
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,828
Oh, please! Landfill!

527
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,410
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

528
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,337
But that space guy, he could be useful.

529
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:37,293
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

530
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,377
Neither are you, Chunk.

531
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,134
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

532
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,682
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

533
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,680
Aw, Mr Softy over here.

534
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,853
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

535
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,149
I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

536
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,851
All them toys are disposable.

537
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,778
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

538
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,658
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

539
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,072
Let me go!

540
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,828
Take him to the libary.

541
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,955
No!

542
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,950
1225 Sycamore.

543
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,906
Woody, what are you doing?

544
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,950
I gotta get outta here.

545
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,957
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

546
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,830
Well, of course I did,
more than I've had in years,

547
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,037
but, you see, I belong to someone else.

548
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,335
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."

549
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,291
Guys, it says "Andy."

550
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,627
He's my Bonnie.

551
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,837
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

552
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,639
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

553
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,968
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

554
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,429
I'll fire up the computer.

555
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,862
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!

556
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,738
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

557
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,488
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

558
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,327
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

559
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,207
He got out, Lotso.

560
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:39,711
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

561
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,302
F-A-Oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I'm so sorry.

562
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,922
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

563
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,224
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

564
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,550
for me and my friends.

565
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,603
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

566
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,521
Well, request granted!

567
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,019
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.

568
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,399
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

569
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,605
Why, I'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

570
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,612
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

571
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,580
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

572
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,499
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

573
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,623
Excellent. I'll go get my friends.

574
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,296
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

575
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,749
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

576
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,755
But my friends don't belong there.

577
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,882
None of us do, I agree.

578
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,386
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

579
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,968
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

580
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,726
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear any more.

581
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,225
Well, I guess that makes sense.

582
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,067
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

583
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,945
Family man, huh? I understand.

584
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,235
Put him back in the timeout chair.

585
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,738
What are ya... Unhand me!

586
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,832
Bring in the Bookworm.

587
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,289
Here it is.

588
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,500
It was filed under "Lightyear."

589
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,763
Let's see here.

590
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,093
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.

591
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,938
"Remove screws to access
battery compartment."

592
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,230
What are you doing?

593
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,937
Stop!

594
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,435
Let go of me!

595
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,907
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

596
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,994
- No!
- "...slide the switch from Play to Demo."

597
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,573
Stop! No! No! No!

598
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,327
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

599
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,002
I'll see what it was.

600
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,336
What do you see? Anything?

601
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,965
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

602
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,679
I see Andy!

603
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,551
- What?
- That's impossible.

604
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,100
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

605
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,097
My other eye! The one I left behind.

606
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,277
This is so weird He 3 packing up.

607
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,817
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

608
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,953
Okay Andy? out in the hall.

609
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,830
He 3 looking in the attic.

610
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,284
Wait; there 3 Mom.
Why is he so upset?

611
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,079
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

612
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,676
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

613
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,294
He's looking for us?

614
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,221
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

615
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,595
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

616
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,430
Well, then, Woody was telling the truth.

617
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,727
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

618
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,350
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

619
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,354
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

620
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,982
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

621
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,689
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

622
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,071
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

623
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,528
There's been a mistake. We have to go.

624
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:01,117
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

625
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,169
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

626
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,962
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

627
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,042
"Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

628
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,047
Just look at my pocketbook!

629
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,515
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.

630
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,972
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?

631
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,895
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

632
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,439
That's better.

633
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,066
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

634
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,239
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

635
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,987
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

636
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,113
Whoa there, missy.

637
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,152
You're not goin' anywhere.

638
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,076
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

639
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,667
Buzz! You're back!

640
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,248
Buzz?

641
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,292
Hey!

642
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,669
Look out!

643
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,170
What are you, nuts?

644
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,463
Buzz!

645
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,507
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

646
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,809
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

647
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,978
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

648
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,521
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?

649
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,643
Oh, boy.

650
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,441
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

651
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,564
Yes, sir!

652
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,784
Where do you think you're going?

653
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,833
Buzz! We're your friends!

654
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,876
Spare me your lies, temptress.

655
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,420
Your emperor's defeated,

656
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,624
and I'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

657
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,335
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

658
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,136
Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus!

659
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,258
Not him.

660
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,841
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

661
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,676
Take him to the box.

662
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,478
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

663
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,976
Bad baby! Bad baby!

664
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,648
Ken? What's going on?

665
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,023
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

666
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,354
What are you doing to my friends?

667
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,231
Get in there!

668
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,655
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

669
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,203
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...

670
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,952
And give me my scarf back!

671
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,746
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

672
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,006
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

673
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,844
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

674
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,046
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

675
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,304
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

676
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,386
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

677
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,768
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

678
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,315
In the box! We get it.

679
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,527
At ease, soldier. They're neutralised.

680
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,073
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

681
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,491
Don't worry, Commander.

682
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,695
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

683
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,950
Listen up, folks.

684
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,533
We got a way of doin' things
here at Sunnyside.

685
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,707
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

686
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,039
life here can be a dream come true!

687
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,921
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

688
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:04,387
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

689
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,969
Woody! What did you do to him?

690
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,855
You all get a good night's rest.

691
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,225
You got a full clay of playtime tomorrow.

692
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,576
1225 Syca...

693
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,117
Who's Velocistar237?

694
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,786
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

695
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,243
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

696
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,124
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

697
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,377
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

698
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,259
Please don't be far. Please, please!

699
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,097
Right around the corner?
it's right around the corner!

700
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,512
I'm going to college! Look at me!
I'm big toy on campus! Hello!

701
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,268
- Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

702
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,939
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

703
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,109
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

704
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,439
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

705
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,320
Well, it wasn't easy.

706
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,533
What do you mean "escape"?

707
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,282
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

708
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,868
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

709
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,207
Lotso?

710
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,956
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

711
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,791
but inside, he's a monster.

712
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,214
But... How do you know that?

713
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,222
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

714
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,971
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

715
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,142
He was a good toy. A friend.

716
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,651
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

717
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,072
I was there
when Lotso got unwrapped

718
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,239
Daisy loved us all.

719
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,911
But Lotso,

720
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,163
Lotso was special.

721
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,833
They did everything together.

722
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,009
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

723
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,836
One day we took a drive.

724
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,099
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

725
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,185
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

726
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,026
She never came back.

727
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,454
Lotso wouldn't give up.

728
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,377
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

729
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,962
But by then, it was too late.

730
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,310
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

731
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,653
Something snapped.

732
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,151
She replaced us. Come on!

733
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,117
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

734
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,910
Didn't she?

735
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,412
She don't love you no more!

736
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,118
Now come on!

737
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:29,630
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

738
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,594
Then we found Sunnyside.

739
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,782
But Lotso wasn't my friend any more.

740
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,490
He wasn't anyone's friend.

741
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,370
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

742
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,827
So how'd you get out?

743
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,627
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

744
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,338
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

745
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,554
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

746
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,303
they don't stand a chance.

747
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,935
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

748
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,388
Returning now would be suicide!

749
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,269
But what about your Andy?

750
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,272
Isn't he leaving for college?

751
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,167
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

752
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,340
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

753
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,758
But he ain't ever comin' back.

754
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,032
Rise and shine, campers!

755
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,708
Commander Lotso, sir!

756
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,043
All quiet, nothing to report.

757
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,714
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

758
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,133
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

759
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,756
Big Baby.

760
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:39,633
Sweetheart!

761
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:45,226
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

762
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,683
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

763
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,487
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

764
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,899
Hello?

765
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,696
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

766
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:21,152
They've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

767
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,363
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

768
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,697
I made it out once.

769
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,659
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

770
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,164
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

771
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,837
Yeah, for how long?

772
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,084
I've been here years.

773
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,590
They'll never break me.

774
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,465
There 3 only one way
toys leave this place.

775
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,055
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

776
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,383
Then it? off to the dump.

777
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,186
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

778
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,390
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

779
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,692
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

780
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,984
Well, if you're gonna get out,

781
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,815
first thing you gotta get through 3
the doors.

782
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,741
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

783
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,867
Got it. What else?

784
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,119
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

785
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,538
Hallway lobby playground

786
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

787
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:15,172
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

788
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,499
You go over or under.

789
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,717
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

790
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,462
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

791
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,382
The monkey? the eye in the sky.

792
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,058
He sees everything.

793
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,307
Classrooms.

794
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,524
Hallways.

795
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,083
Even the playground

796
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,755
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

797
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:07,467
but if you don't take out that monkey
you ain't going nowhere.

798
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,265
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

799
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,439
Recess! Come on, kids!

800
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,938
Hey, guys.

801
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,442
- Woody?
- Woody!

802
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,905
Woody!

803
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,779
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!

804
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,115
- You're alive!
- 'Course I'm alive!

805
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,168
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

806
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,916
Lotso did something to him!

807
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,123
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

808
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,628
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

809
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,626
Return of the astro-nut.

810
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,466
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

811
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,176
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

812
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,512
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

813
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,848
From now on, we stick together.

814
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,683
But Andy's leavin' 'for college.

815
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,643
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

816
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,354
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

817
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,984
Tomorrow? But that means...

818
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,066
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

819
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,993
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

820
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,405
No, there is one way out.

821
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,039
One way.

822
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,415
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

823
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,002
- Springy dog.
- Present.

824
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,174
Green guys.

825
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,382
- Cowgirl.
- Here.

826
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,012
Horse.

827
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,602
- Piggy bank.
- Yo.

828
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,850
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.

829
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,060
- Barbie.
- Here.

830
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,017
Potato Head.

831
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,561
Potato Head?

832
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,528
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

833
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,867
Impossible!

834
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,574
Hey!

835
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,919
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

836
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,596
That? Mr Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

837
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,391
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

838
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,011
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

839
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:19,060
Yeah, and I would've got away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!

840
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,561
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

841
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,019
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

842
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,274
You're a purse with legs.

843
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,696
Take him back to the box.

844
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:31,072
No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

845
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,654
Really. No, no, no!

846
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,238
Okay, check.

847
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,460
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

848
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,912
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

849
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,089
Ken! Ken?

850
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,593
What do you want?

851
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,093
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

852
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,970
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that yesterday.

853
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,468
I was wrong.

854
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,679
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

855
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:02,141
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

856
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,647
Darn it, Barbie!

857
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,605
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

858
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,824
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

859
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,658
Wait. I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

860
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,206
Go get the tape!

861
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,629
And this is where the magic happens.

862
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,348
Look at all your clothes!

863
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,221
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

864
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,806
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.

865
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,604
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

866
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,853
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

867
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,526
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

868
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,361
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

869
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,408
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

870
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,367
Just a few?

871
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,153
Go get the key.

872
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:14,819
Where is it, where is it?

873
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,821
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

874
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,371
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

875
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,378
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

876
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,217
Make a move, porky!

877
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,796
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

878
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,221
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.

879
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,472
No wonder you're extinct.

880
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,730
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

881
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,235
Help! Prison riot!

882
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,819
Get the tortilla.

883
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,774
- Ready?
- Ready.

884
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,828
Barbie?

885
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,754
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

886
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,046
And how do we switch him back?

887
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,045
You can't make me talk. You can't!

888
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,419
But I'd like to see you try.

889
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,890
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

890
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,768
Barbie! Those were vintage!

891
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,694
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

892
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,272
They're a dime a dozen.

893
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,698
Glitter tux.

894
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,574
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

895
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,867
A Nehru jacket.

896
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,456
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

897
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,251
This is from what, 1967?

898
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,919
The groovy formal collection, yes!

899
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:18,707
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

900
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,883
There's an instruction manual!

901
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,300
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

902
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,181
Where's that manual?

903
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,269
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

904
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,513
but here you go.

905
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,153
What's takin' so doggone long?

906
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,909
So how do we fix Buzz?

907
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,307
What are you looking at, feathers?

908
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,644
Hey!

909
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,817
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

910
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,943
Well, that's just great.

911
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,497
Help! Prison riot!

912
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,749
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.

913
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:42,257
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."

914
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,297
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."

915
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,969
Shush! Will you be quiet?

916
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,596
Woody! You're back!

917
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,806
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

918
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,889
Star Command! I've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

919
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,771
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

920
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,397
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

921
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,113
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

922
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,737
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

923
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,365
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

924
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,118
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

925
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,291
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!

926
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,413
What?

927
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,627
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

928
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,956
"Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

929
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,468
It's not my fault!

930
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,642
Star Log...

931
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,140
I've awakened from hyper-sleep
on a strange planet.

932
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,564
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!

933
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:43,610
I'm surrounded by alien creatures
of unknown intent.

934
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,732
Who goes there?

935
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,858
Friend?

936
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:46,984
Or foe?

937
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,274
Amigos! We're all amigos.

938
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,362
I must have crash-landed
and had my memory erased.

939
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,535
Anyone seen my spaceship?

940
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,075
We gotta switch him back.

941
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,252
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

942
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,046
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

943
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,749
My spaceship?
You know where it is?

944
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,924
Excellent!

945
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,836
Good luck, cowboy.

946
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,135
Here they come.

947
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,014
Come on, Buzz!

948
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,275
What took you so long?

949
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,603
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

950
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,063
We haven't seen him.

951
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:31,657
Buzz.

952
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,078
My desert flower!

953
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:40,246
I have never seen true beauty
until this night!

954
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,244
Did you fix Buzz?

955
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,499
- Sort of.
- Behind you.

956
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,126
Someone's coming.

957
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,679
You would not believe
what I've been through tonight.

958
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,472
Darling! Are you okay?

959
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,096
I feel fresh. Healthy. it's terrible.

960
01:08:57,175 --> 01:09:00,270
You've lost weight. And so tall.

961
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,440
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

962
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,984
All clear.

963
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,156
Come on. Come on.

964
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,326
We're almost there.

965
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,415
Back up. Back up!

966
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,343
Come on.

967
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,121
Come with me!

968
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,449
I will show you
the wonders of the galaxy...

969
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,744
...and we shall vanquish
all evil with our love!

970
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,673
Woody!

971
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,503
Come on. We're almost there.

972
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,303
The Cowboy!

973
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,772
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

974
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,401
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

975
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,238
It is open.

976
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,490
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

977
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,952
- Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

978
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,297
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.

979
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,300
Come on clown. But not all at once.

980
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,256
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."

981
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,683
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

982
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,135
- Geronimo!
- Look out!

983
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,022
Thanks, Jess.

984
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,645
Where's my spaceship?

985
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,771
Almost there, guys.

986
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,444
Slink, you think you can make it?

987
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,774
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

988
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,073
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.

989
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,825
Okay, climb across.

990
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,284
You lost, little doggie?

991
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,624
Well, well. Look who's back.

992
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,300
I'm sorry cowboy.

993
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,269
They broke me.

994
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,063
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

995
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,816
He don't want you no more.

996
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,063
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

997
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,319
Tell me this, Sheriff.

998
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,490
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

999
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,825
You think you're special, cowboy?

1000
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,493
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

1001
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,708
Speak of the devil.

1002
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,793
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

1003
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,504
and you need to avoid that truck.

1004
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:06,512
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

1005
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,061
This isn't a family! it's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

1006
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,482
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

1007
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:18,320
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

1008
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,691
not from the threat of force.

1009
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,945
If that's what you want.

1010
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,908
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1011
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:32,205
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

1012
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,372
Not to me, there's not.

1013
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,547
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1014
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,919
Oh, Ken!

1015
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,219
Everyone, listen!

1016
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,640
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

1017
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,885
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1018
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,686
and he put himself on top!

1019
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,730
Anyone concur with Ken?

1020
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,566
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1021
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:05,317
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1022
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,367
Wait! What about Daisy?

1023
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,364
I don't know what you're talking about.

1024
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,075
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1025
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,126
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.

1026
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,997
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

1027
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,923
She replaced you.

1028
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,796
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1029
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,465
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1030
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,265
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

1031
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,557
She never loved me.

1032
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,476
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1033
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:37,853
Mama.

1034
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,731
What? You want your mommy back?

1035
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,609
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1036
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,326
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1037
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,451
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1038
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:57,127
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1039
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,793
Hey, stop it! Put me clown, you idiot!

1040
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,419
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1041
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,716
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.

1042
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,056
Come on. Hurry!

1043
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,068
For crying out loud!

1044
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:27,194
Cowboy, hurry!

1045
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,698
Woody!

1046
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,955
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1047
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,374
Come on!

1048
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,877
Barbie, no!

1049
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,549
Woody!

1050
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,679
No!

1051
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,224
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

1052
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:04,106
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

1053
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,613
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1054
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,109
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1055
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,407
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

1056
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,459
Miss! Where are you?!

1057
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:21,535
Buzz!

1058
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,218
They'll never make it!

1059
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,104
Look out!

1060
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:49,988
Buzz!

1061
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,745
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

1062
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,003
Buzz, you okay?

1063
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,173
Buzz! Buzz!

1064
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,726
That wasn't me, was it?

1065
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:23,849
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1066
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,480
Yes, I'm back. Where have I been?

1067
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,819
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1068
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,065
Woody! So where are we now?

1069
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,612
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1070
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,874
Hold on, we're going in!

1071
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,891
You got all your pieces?

1072
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,567
The claw!

1073
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,154
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!

1074
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:14,611
No!

1075
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,497
Hang on!

1076
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,046
Woody! What do we do?

1077
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,847
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1078
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,759
- Woody!
- Slinky!

1079
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,304
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1080
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,190
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you clown.

1081
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,938
You might wanna take a look at this.

1082
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,526
Quick! Grab something metal!

1083
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,196
You heard the guy.

1084
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,868
It's not working!

1085
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,712
Help! Help me. I'm stuck!

1086
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,587
Help, please! Help!

1087
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,426
Woody!

1088
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,680
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

1089
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,642
Woody!

1090
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,524
Go, go!

1091
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,907
Thank you, Sheriff.

1092
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,207
We're all in this together.

1093
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,617
Right, guys?

1094
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,124
Guys?

1095
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,585
Woody! Down here!

1096
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,252
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.

1097
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,594
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1098
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,425
We're gonna be okay!

1099
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,351
Hey!

1100
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,679
I don't think that's daylight.

1101
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,152
Run!

1102
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:36,040
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1103
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,170
Come on!

1104
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,383
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1105
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,095
Hurry!

1106
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,898
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!

1107
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,355
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1108
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,023
No. No!

1109
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,278
Lotso!

1110
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,740
No!

1111
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,967
Rex!

1112
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,100
Buzz! What do we do?

1113
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,307
The claw.

1114
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,130
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1115
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,461
I take it all back.

1116
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,504
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

1117
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,729
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1118
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:42,602
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

1119
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,279
My boys!

1120
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,571
Daddy!

1121
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,108
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1122
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,193
Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

1123
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:54,034
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1124
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,915
- Hey!
- What you got?

1125
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,626
I had me one of these when I was a kid.

1126
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:09,886
Strawberries.

1127
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,144
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1128
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,736
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1129
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,234
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

1130
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,358
What about you guys? I mean,

1131
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,028
maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

1132
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:39,075
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

1133
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,165
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!

1134
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,963
Wait, I'll check!

1135
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:49,009
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost clone!

1136
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,884
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

1137
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,073
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?

1138
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,866
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1139
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:13,988
Okay. Come on.

1140
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,739
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1141
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,745
All right. Go. Go, go!

1142
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,463
Okay. All clear.

1143
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,761
There you are.

1144
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,690
- There you go.
- Buzz.

1145
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:56,110
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1146
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,070
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1147
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:02,287
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

1148
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,960
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1149
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:06,833
Sure thing.

1150
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,879
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1151
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,420
'Course I will. Besides, I know about

1152
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:17,097
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

1153
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,015
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

1154
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,684
I'll get something on the way.

1155
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,265
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1156
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:39,824
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1157
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:42,497
Mom, we've said goodbye like 10 times.

1158
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,498
Andy.

1159
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,671
Mom, it's okay.

1160
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,306
I know. It's just...

1161
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,770
I wish I could always be with you.

1162
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,687
You will be, Mom.

1163
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,208
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1164
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,457
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1165
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,415
Who's a good doggy? I'm gonna
miss you. I'm gonna miss you.

1166
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,176
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.

1167
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:46,388
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1168
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,642
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1169
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,233
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1170
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:58,823
Hey.

1171
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:09,752
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

1172
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,088
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1173
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,778
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1174
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,114
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."

1175
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:49,666
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

1176
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,165
Mom.

1177
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,542
- Andy?
- Hi.

1178
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,420
Wow. Look at you.

1179
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,376
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1180
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,336
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1181
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,547
So, what can we do for you?

1182
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,844
I have some toys here.

1183
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,934
You hear that, Bonnie?

1184
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,475
So, you're Bonnie?

1185
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:12,981
I'm Andy.

1186
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,814
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1187
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,694
These are mine,
but I'm going away now,

1188
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,776
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1189
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:35,170
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1190
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,667
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1191
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,841
Here.

1192
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:02,072
This is Rex, the meanest,
most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1193
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:12,078
The Potato Heads. Mr and Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1194
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,367
'cause they're madly in love.

1195
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:18,459
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1196
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,337
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1197
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:26,638
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr Pork Chop.

1198
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,849
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1199
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,604
Pizza Planet.

1200
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,561
And this

1201
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:43,321
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1202
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,483
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1203
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:50,245
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1204
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,582
To infinity and beyond!

1205
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,711
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1206
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:04,502
They mean a lot to me.

1207
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,766
My cowboy!

1208
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,772
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1209
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,560
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha...?

1210
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,731
There 3 a snake in my boot.

1211
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:44,124
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1212
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,924
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1213
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:49,971
And kind. And smart.

1214
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:55,890
But the thing that makes Woody special
is he'll never give up on you.

1215
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,388
Ever.

1216
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,979
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1217
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,656
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1218
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:10,741
Okay then.

1219
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:25,545
Oh, no! Dr Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1220
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:28,342
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!

1221
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,965
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1222
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,839
And we'll actually need the rocket.

1223
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,805
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1224
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:41,894
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

1225
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,817
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1226
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,270
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1227
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,525
Mr and Mrs Potato Head
are in trouble.

1228
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,107
Get on, Woody.

1229
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,614
It's my friend Woody.

1230
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:57,288
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1231
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,226
Thanks, guys.

1232
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,820
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1233
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,367
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1234
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:50,254
So long, partner.

1235
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:58,592
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1236
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:01,394
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.

1237
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,259
New toys!

1238
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,852
Noses.

1239
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:10,270
"So I guess you could say
Sunnyside is sunny once again!

1240
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:13,860
"Hope to hear from you soon. We're all
super excited about your new home.

1241
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,529
"Hugs and kisses to everyone."

1242
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,692
That Barbie has some nice handwriting.

1243
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,158
Buzz, Barbie didn't write this.

1244
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:27,870
- Grab the sword!
- I got it!

1245
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,121
- Okay, go for the...
- Triple bonus!

1246
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,326
- Watch out!
- We got the cloak of darkness!

1247
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,129
- Run, run!
- My arms are never long enough!

1248
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:35,582
I'll do it! This is it! This is it!

1249
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,800
- Yes!
- We did it!

1250
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,843
High-five! Hold on.

1251
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:45,342
Well, it's official.
You guys made the wall.

1252
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:48,474
- Look at this!
- Golly bob howdy! That's me!

1253
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:51,898
We're all up here!
Hey, Chuckles, lookin' good.

1254
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,271
Yeah, she really got your smile.

1255
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:03,029
What the...

1256
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:07,746
I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

1257
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:12,251
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

1258
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:15,922
Romeo, o Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

1259
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:18,591
Next season, we're doing Cats.

1260
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,294
Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1261
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:25,261
Yeah. Detached wing.
Cosmetic damage.

1262
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,934
Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1263
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,814
I don't know what came over me.

1264
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,824
Just go with it, Buzz.

1266
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,087
