1
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,046
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,070
Maybe if I were happier,
my hair wouldn't be falling out.

3
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:31,720
Life is short. I need
to make the most of it.

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,369
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

5
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,767
I'm a walking cliche.

6
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,583
I really need to go to the doctor
and have my leg checked.

7
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,355
There's something wrong.
A bump.

8
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,962
The dentist called again.
I'm way overdue.

9
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,361
If I stopped putting things off,
I'd be happier.

10
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,157
All I do is sit on my fat ass.
If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

11
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:55,494
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts
with the tails out all the time.

12
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:57,162
Like that's fooling anyone.

13
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,229
Fat ass. I should start jogging again.
Five miles a day.

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,357
Really do it this time.
Maybe rock climbing.

15
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,234
I need to turn my life around.

16
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,049
What do I need to do?
I need to fall in love.

17
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,613
I need to have a girlfriend.

18
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:13,012
I need to read more,
improve myself.

19
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,993
What if I learned Russian
or something?

20
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:18,121
Or took up an instrument?
I could speak Chinese.

21
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:21,771
I would be the screenwriter who
speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

22
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,586
That would be cool.
I should get my hair cut short.

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,923
Stop trying to fool everyone
into thinking I have a full head of hair.

24
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:31,155
How pathetic is that?
Just be real. Confident.

25
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,449
Isn't that what women
are attracted to?

26
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,222
Men don't have to be attractive.

27
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,829
But that's not true,
especially these days.

28
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,061
Almost as much pressure on men
as there is on women these days.

29
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,294
Why should I be made to feel I have
to apologize for my existence?

30
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:46,066
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,569
Maybe that's what's wrong with me:
bad chemistry.

32
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,697
All my problems and anxiety can be
reduced to a chemical imbalance...

33
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,782
...or some kind of
misfiring synapses.

34
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,764
I need to get help for that.

35
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:58,058
But I'll still be ugly, though.

36
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,934
Nothing's gonna change that.

37
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,081
Shut up!

38
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,338
Let's really try today
to solve our camera problems.

39
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,883
Keep between-take time
at an absolute minimum.

40
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:13,281
These masks are really hot. Okay?

41
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:16,097
I wanna be very well-heard
on that from everybody.

42
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:21,206
Don't futz unless it's absolutely
important to the shot, okay?

43
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:24,543
I don't say that for me.
I say that for the people sitting here...

44
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,316
- Thank you, John.
- ...in the rubber.

45
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,027
- I like my dress. Okay?
- Very good.

46
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:32,676
So now, folks, you better
heed that advice.

47
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:36,013
Stand by for picture.

48
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:40,392
Have her rotate around the table
a little bit further.

49
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,668
Hold on until we're clear.

50
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:47,900
You. You're in the eyeline.
Can you please get off the stage?

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,298
Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,223
What am I doing here?
Why did I bother to come here today?

53
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,413
Nobody even seems to know
my name.

54
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:05,731
I've been on this planet for 40 years,
and I don't understand a single thing.

55
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:08,755
Why am I here?
How did I get here?

56
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,982
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

57
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,588
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat.
Stop sweating.

58
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,882
I've got to stop sweating.

59
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,802
Can she see it dripping
down my forehead?

60
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:18,722
She looked at my hairline.
She thinks I'm bald. She--

61
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,329
We think you're great.

62
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,205
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,229
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

64
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,732
- Thanks. Thanks....
- Such a unique voice.

65
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,547
Boy, I'd love to find
a portal into your brain.

66
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,529
Trust me, it's no fun.

67
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:38,742
So tell me your thoughts
on this crazy little project of ours.

68
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,496
First, I think it's a great book.

69
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,146
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
- Absolutely.

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,587
And Orlean makes orchids
so fascinating.

71
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:53,340
Plus, her musings on Florida
and orchid poaching...

72
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,781
...Indians. It's just-- It's great,
sprawling New Yorker stuff.

73
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,450
I'd want to remain true to that.

74
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:02,725
I'd wanna let the movie exist,
rather than be...

75
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:06,270
- ...artificially plot-driven.
- Great.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,190
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what that means.

77
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:14,925
I'm not sure I know
what that means either.

78
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:18,053
I just don't wanna ruin it by making
it a Hollywood thing. You know?

79
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:23,058
Like...an orchid heist movie
or something, you know?

80
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,665
Or changing the orchids
into poppies...

81
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:27,750
...and making it about drug running,
you know?

82
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,836
- Definitely.
- Why can't there be a movie...

83
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,921
...simply about flowers?

84
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:34,424
I guess we thought that maybe...

85
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:37,969
...Susan Orlean and Laroche
could fall in love, and--

86
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:41,932
Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,
I don't wanna cram in sex...

87
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:45,164
...or guns or car chases...

88
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,918
...you know,
or characters, you know...

89
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,629
...learning profound life lessons.

90
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,714
Or growing,
or coming to like each other...

91
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,260
...or overcoming obstacles to succeed
in the end, you know? I mean--

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,866
The book isn't like that...

93
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:03,933
...and life isn't like that.
You know, it just isn't. And....

94
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,355
I feel very strongly about this.

95
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,569
John Laroche is a tall guy,
skinny as a stick...

96
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,489
...pale-eyed,
slouch-shouldered...

97
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:22,389
...sharply handsome, despite the fact
he's missing all his front teeth.

98
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:26,143
I went to Florida two years ago
to write a piece for The New Yorker.

99
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:30,418
It was after reading a small article about
a white man and three Seminole men...

100
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,234
...arrested with rare orchids
they'd stolen out of a place...

101
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:36,779
...called the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

102
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,495
As natural selection works solely by
and for the good of each being...

103
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:50,960
...all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.

104
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,131
It's interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank....

105
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:15,152
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

106
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,280
A ghost.

107
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,702
Cut her down, Russell.

108
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,748
- Morning.
- Hey.

109
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,876
May I ask you gentlemen what you
have in those pillowcases?

110
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,587
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

111
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,028
- Okay, then, I'm asking.
- Well, okay, then.

112
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,592
Let's see.

113
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,763
We've got five kinds of bromeliad...

114
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:27,413
...one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties.

115
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:32,522
You know,
about 130 plants all told.

116
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,025
Which my colleagues here
removed from the swamp.

117
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:39,821
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants
or animals from state-owned land?

118
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,802
Yeah, and don't forget...

119
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:45,452
...these plants are all endangered, sir.
Every one of them.

120
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:49,727
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.

121
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,917
Yes, sir. It is.

122
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,462
- But--
- My colleagues are all Seminole Indians.

123
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,860
Did I mention that?
You're familiar, I'm sure...

124
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,467
...with the State of Florida
v. James E. Billie?

125
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:05,889
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

126
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:08,079
...one of what, 40 in the entire world?

127
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,539
- Forty.
- Forty.

128
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:12,250
The state couldn't successfully
prosecute him...

129
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,274
...because, you know, he's an Indian,
and it's his right.

130
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:20,592
As repugnant as you and I, as white
conservationists, might find his actions.

131
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:23,407
- But--
- Not to mention the failed attempts...

132
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:28,100
...on three occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

133
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:33,522
Which I believe they use to thatch
the roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

134
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,441
How about that?
With the chickee huts, right?

135
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:40,717
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what
we use them for. Chickee huts.

136
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,181
Yeah, but I don't--

137
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,727
I can't let you fellas leave yet.

138
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,106
- Just hold on there a minute.
- Okay.

139
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,277
Charles, is that you?

140
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:03,135
Did you eat lunch?

141
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,619
I had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.
Was it yours?

142
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,060
I hope not. I couldn't remember,
so I ate it.

143
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,292
Maybe we should write our names
on our food items from now on.

144
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,108
- What's with you?
- My back.

145
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:21,696
Charles, you'll be glad. I have a plan
to get me out of your house, pronto.

146
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:26,701
- A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?
- Drum roll, please.

147
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:31,185
I'm gonna be a screenwriter.
Like you.

148
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:34,209
I know you think this is just
one of my "get rich quick" schemes...

149
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,981
...but I'm doing it right this time.

150
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:39,944
I'm taking a three-day seminar,
and it's only 500 bucks.

151
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:42,759
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

152
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,783
In theory, I agree with you.
But this one's different.

153
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,868
This one's highly regarded
in the industry.

154
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,371
Donald, don't say "industry."

155
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,456
I'm sorry. I forgot.

156
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,167
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

157
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,774
People come from all over
to study with him.

158
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,590
- I'll pay you back as soon as I--
- Let me explain something.

159
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:04,552
Anybody who says he's got "the answer"
is going to attract desperate people...

160
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,116
...be it in the world of religion--

161
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:08,827
I just need to lie down
while you explain this to me.

162
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,121
Sorry. I apologize.

163
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,728
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:16,335
- So--
- Sorry. Okay. Go.

165
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,795
There are no rules, Donald.

166
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:20,401
And anybody who says there are
is just, you know--

167
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:23,738
Not rules. Principles.

168
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:28,118
McKee writes that a rule says,
"You must do it this way."

169
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:33,019
A principle says, "This works
and has through all remembered time."

170
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,147
The script I'm starting,
it's about flowers.

171
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:39,275
Nobody's ever done a movie
about flowers before.

172
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,342
- So there are no guidelines.
- What about Flowers for Algernon?

173
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:46,261
Well, that's not about flowers.
And it's not a movie.

174
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,242
I'm sorry. I never saw it.

175
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,911
How--? Okay, keep going.

176
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:52,622
Look, my point is
that those teachers are dangerous...

177
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,812
...if your goal is to try
to do something new.

178
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:58,774
A writer should always have that goal.
Writing is a journey into the unknown.

179
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:02,215
It's not building, you know,
one of your model airplanes.

180
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:09,201
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar,
Charles.

181
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:12,538
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

182
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:18,899
Say something. I dragged her here,
and now I'm not saying anything.

183
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,880
Make her laugh.
Say something funny.

184
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,738
I hate parties, Amelia.
Why did we come here?

185
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,658
Because we're hip, young trendsetters
on the make, aren't we?

186
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:30,473
More like old losers
sitting on the floor, maybe.

187
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:35,582
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself.
Okay....

188
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,710
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

189
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:43,403
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie
Kaufman mess for once and for all.

190
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:45,175
- Okay.
- Okay, let me see.

191
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,721
What do you need?
What, what, what?

192
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:51,849
Well, I'm glad you took
the orchid script.

193
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:55,290
I think it will be good for you
to get out of your head.

194
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:59,878
I think it'll ground you to think about the
bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

195
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,902
I still can't believe they gave me
that job.

196
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:07,073
I mean, after that lunch.
I was sweating insanely.

197
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,992
I was ranting. I was a mess.

198
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:12,182
You were just nervous
because she was pretty.

199
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,059
How do you know she was pretty?

200
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:18,230
After eight months of knowing you,
I think I get what makes you sweat.

201
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,088
Well, whatever.
Well, moving on, what next?

202
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,842
You need a new getup.
This whole flannel shirt thing...

203
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:29,596
...it's not really doing anything
for you anymore.

204
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,435
Thanks for coming out
with me tonight, Amelia.

205
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,266
To begin.

206
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,725
To begin.

207
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,124
How to start?

208
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,252
I'm hungry.

209
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:01,816
I should get coffee.

210
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,901
Coffee would help me think.

211
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:07,760
But I should write something first,
then reward myself with coffee.

212
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,599
Coffee and a muffin. Okay,
so I need to establish the themes.

213
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,831
Maybe banana-nut.

214
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,230
That's a good muffin.

215
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,860
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

216
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,344
Victorian-era orchid hunter
William Arnold...

217
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:32,264
...drowned on a collecting expedition.

218
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,435
Osmers vanished without a trace
in Asia.

219
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:45,298
Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

220
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,677
...only to be murdered when
he completed his mission...

221
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:52,805
...and traveled beyond Bhamo.

222
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,645
Laroche loved orchids, but I....

223
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:02,607
I came to believe he loved the
difficulty and fatality of getting them...

224
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:06,465
...almost as much as he loved
the orchids themselves.

225
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:10,323
I've been a professional horticulturist
for, like, 12 years.

226
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:15,433
I owned my own plant nursery,
which was destroyed by the hurricane.

227
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,622
I'm a professional plant lecturer.

228
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:21,168
I've given over, like, 60 lectures
on the cultivation of plants.

229
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:25,130
I'm a published author,
both in magazine and book form.

230
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,633
And I have extensive experience
with orchids...

231
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:33,368
...and the asexual micropropagation
of orchids under aseptic cultures.

232
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,268
That's laboratory work.
It's not at all like your nursery work.

233
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:41,605
I'm probably the smartest person
I know.

234
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,421
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

235
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,615
Mr.Laroche?
I'm Susan Orlean.

236
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,327
I'm a writer for The New Yorker.
It's a magazine that--

237
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,516
I'm familiar with The New Yorker.

238
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,957
"The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker." Right?

239
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,626
That's right.

240
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:05,588
I'm very interested in doing a piece
on your situation here, and--

241
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,361
Yeah? Yeah.

242
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,446
You wanna put this in?

243
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,636
I don't care what goes on here.

244
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,868
I'm right, and I'll take it all the way
to Supreme Court.

245
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:18,205
Because that judge can screw herself.

246
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,424
- That for real would go in?
- Absolutely.

247
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:39,581
We open on State Road 29.

248
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,126
A battered white van speeds along,
making a sharp, skidding right...

249
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,046
...into the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

250
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:49,800
The driver of the van is a skinny man
with no front teeth.

251
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:53,241
This is John Laroche.

252
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,369
I need a break.

253
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:02,104
- I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

254
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,649
- The end was a little weird, but--
- Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

255
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,213
It was exultant.

256
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:12,114
The soloist was amazing.
Such beautiful tones. So precise.

257
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,782
God, it blows my mind.

258
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,911
- I wish I could play like that.
- You do.

259
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,082
Charlie. I don't.
I'm mediocre at best.

260
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,480
Well, I love listening to you play.

261
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,253
Thanks, Charlie.

262
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,841
Here we are.

263
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,723
What are you up to now, then?

264
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:41,832
I should probably get to bed.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

265
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:44,334
Well, good night, then.

266
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,136
I would stay out.

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,473
It's just that I've really been struggling
on the script right now.

268
00:17:57,473 --> 00:18:01,122
I've been thinking about it too small,
just writing it like a story about Laroche.

269
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:04,459
That's not enough. I mean,
I wanted to write about flowers.

270
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,734
Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I
haven't been sleeping very well lately...

271
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,507
...so I thought I should get home...

272
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:14,886
...and try to get a good night's sleep,
you know. Start fresh in the morning.

273
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,972
Otherwise, I'd stay out.

274
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:21,351
I understand. I hope you figure it out,
Charlie. I really do.

275
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,480
Thanks. Thanks for coming out
with me and everything.

276
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,461
Sure, it was fun.

277
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:31,362
So I have to go to Santa Barbara next
weekend for this orchid show up there.

278
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:34,281
I thought maybe you could come.

279
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:36,367
No, I....

280
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,120
I don't think I can make it
next weekend.

281
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,519
I don't think I can.

282
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,230
I've got something. Sorry.

283
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,002
Okay.

284
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,131
So, well, okay, then.
So good night, then.

285
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,425
Good night, Charlie.

286
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,178
Why didn't I go in?
I'm such a chicken.

287
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:59,202
I'm such an idiot. I should have
kissed her. I've blown it.

288
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,122
I should just go and knock
on her door right now and kiss her.

289
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:06,814
It would be romantic. Something
we could someday tell our kids.

290
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,734
I'm gonna do that right now.

291
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:27,877
- Thanks for picking me up.
- This van's a piece of shit.

292
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:31,214
But when I hit the jackpot,
I'll buy myself an awesome car.

293
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,925
Hey, what are you driving?

294
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,802
It's-- Well, it's a rental.

295
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:39,035
- It's a Lumina.
- Awesome.

296
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,954
I think I'll get one of those too.

297
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,524
Here we go.

298
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:54,050
Where do these people learn
to drive, huh?

299
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,927
The world's insane.

300
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,638
So I was impressed to hear...

301
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:01,349
...how accomplished you are
in the world of horticulture.

302
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,435
The thing you gotta know is...

303
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,563
...my whole life is looking for
a goddamn profitable plant, see?

304
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,023
And that's the ghost.

305
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,274
Why the ghost orchid?

306
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:13,862
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

307
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:18,241
And I'm the only one in the world
who knows how to cultivate it.

308
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,578
See, the idea was, get the Indians
to pull it from the swamp.

309
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:25,853
I researched it. Long as I don't touch
the plant, Florida can't touch us.

310
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,380
And I stop future poaching by making
the flowers readily available in stores.

311
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,299
I'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

312
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,802
...Laroche and nature win.

313
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,617
Great.

314
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,016
Did you get that last part?

315
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,997
Yeah, I sure did.

316
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,333
Orchids are the sexiest flowers
on Earth.

317
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:52,964
The name orchid derives from the
Latin orchis, which means testicle.

318
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,424
Hey, Charles.

319
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:56,405
I pitched my screenplay to Mom.

320
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:58,386
Don't say "pitch."

321
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:00,889
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

322
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,183
...Silence of the Lambs
meets Psycho.

323
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:07,562
Maybe you guys could collaborate.
I hear Mom's really good with structure.

324
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,942
So how come Amelia
doesn't come around anymore?

325
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:15,279
Did you put the moves on her
or something?

326
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,807
I'm looking for John Laroche.

327
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:48,333
I'm writing an article on John,
and I stopped by.

328
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,210
- I hoped I could see him.
- John's not here.

329
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,049
Well, you were at the swamp
with him, weren't you?

330
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,926
I saw you at the courthouse,
that's how I know.

331
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,116
I'm Matthew Osceola.

332
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,201
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

333
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:05,121
Maybe I could talk to you
for a second.

334
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,936
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the whole operation....

335
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:10,856
You have very beautiful hair.

336
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:17,425
Thank you very much.

337
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,198
Thank you. I just....

338
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:23,682
I just washed it this morning.

339
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:27,227
I just used a new conditioner.

340
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:34,109
I can see your sadness.

341
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,090
It's lovely.

342
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:42,451
Well, I'm just tired, that's all.
That's my problem.

343
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:44,849
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

344
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:49,124
- ...and I could get some background--
- I'm not going to talk to you much.

345
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,001
It's not personal.

346
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:54,234
It's the Indian way.

347
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:09,145
Angraecum sesquipedale.

348
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,377
Beauty! God!

349
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:14,671
Darwin wrote about this one.

350
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:19,468
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy?
Hello?

351
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,553
You see that nectary
all the way down there?

352
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,951
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

353
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,809
...with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

354
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:30,104
Everyone thought he was a loon.

355
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,796
Then, sure enough, they found
this moth with a 12-inch proboscis.

356
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:37,924
- "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
- I know what "proboscis" means.

357
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:42,199
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

358
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,910
The point is,
what's so wonderful...

359
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,247
...is that every one of these flowers
has a specific relationship...

360
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:50,124
...with the insect that pollinates it.

361
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:53,044
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

362
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,963
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

363
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:59,300
...its double, its soul mate...

364
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,949
...and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

365
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,556
After the insect flies off...

366
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:10,561
...it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

367
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:14,107
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand...

368
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,235
...the significance
of their lovemaking.

369
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,093
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

370
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:23,074
But it does.

371
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,368
By simply doing
what they're designed to do...

372
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:28,392
...something large
and magnificent happens.

373
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,790
In this sense, they show us
how to live.

374
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:34,753
How the only barometer
you have is your heart.

375
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:40,383
How when you spot your flower,
you can't let anything get in your way.

376
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:50,602
He's really quite a character.
No front teeth.

377
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:54,043
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all.
- Why doesn't he get them fixed?

378
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,588
It seems almost sociopathic
to make everybody look at that.

379
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,612
Yeah, but he gives
a great blowjob, honey.

380
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:04,888
He is a fascinating character, though.

381
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:07,390
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

382
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,040
It could be. I don't know, you know?
He's....

383
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,315
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed
with his dead mother, and....

384
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:19,799
He wears his sunglasses on
a little dingle-dangle around his neck.

385
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,571
Loving it.

386
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:25,742
- Tell them about the van.
- Okay, the van. The van.

387
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,975
- I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.
- No, tell us about the van.

388
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,311
- It's amazing. It's....
- What's in it?

389
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,857
- You did it in the van.
- Shut up.

390
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:38,463
David, you tell--
Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

391
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,132
Okay, the van.

392
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,322
David!

393
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,493
This van was filled with junk--

394
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:47,640
Shut up!

395
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:52,123
Potting soil. Shovels.
Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

396
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:55,564
Susie said she hoped
it was fertilizer, anyway.

397
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,422
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche
had a certain aromatic look about him.

398
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:00,465
And she said--

399
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:04,219
She said perhaps his obsessiveness
didn't leave room in his schedule...

400
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:06,513
...for personal hygiene.

401
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:10,788
Maybe the orchids got
all the available water.

402
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:17,149
I wanted to want something as much
as people wanted these plants.

403
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,234
But...

404
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,092
...it isn't part of my constitution.

405
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:28,619
I suppose I do have
one unembarrassed passion.

406
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:35,814
I wanna know what it feels like
to care about something passionately.

407
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:50,620
"Should one be lucky enough
to see a ghost orchid...

408
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,061
...all else will seem eclipsed."

409
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:59,796
If the ghost orchid
was really a phantom...

410
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:04,384
...it was still such a bewitching one that
it could seduce people to pursue it...

411
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,825
...year after year
and mile after miserable mile.

412
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:11,371
If it was a real flower,
I wanted to see one.

413
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:15,229
The reason was not that I love orchids.
I don't even especially like orchids.

414
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:18,878
What I wanted
was to see this thing...

415
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:25,552
...that people were drawn to
in such a singular and powerful way.

416
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:31,704
So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?

417
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,519
I lost interest right after that.

418
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,359
I dropped turtles when I fell
in love with Ice Age fossils.

419
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:43,070
Collected the shit out of them.

420
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,241
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

421
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:51,203
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

422
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:53,393
My mom and I
had the largest collection...

423
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:56,625
...of 19th-century Dutch mirrors
on the planet.

424
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,649
Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World, October '88?

425
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,360
I got a copy here somewhere.

426
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:07,157
I guess I'd just like to know
how you can detach from something...

427
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,764
...that you've invested
so much of your soul in.

428
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:14,560
I mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

429
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,940
The only thing that made
your 10-year-old life worth living?

430
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:22,798
Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?

431
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:28,845
I once fell deeply, you know,
profoundly in love with tropical fish.

432
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,931
I had 60 goddamn fish-tanks
in my house.

433
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:33,851
I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones.

434
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:39,481
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus
ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

435
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,358
You name it.

436
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,799
Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

437
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:49,387
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

438
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:52,203
That's how much "fuck fish."

439
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:57,833
That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

440
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:00,023
And I love the ocean.

441
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:03,151
But why?

442
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:07,218
Done with fish.

443
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:12,640
If you'd really loved something,
wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

444
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,873
Evidently Laroche's finishes
were downright and absolute.

445
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:17,437
He just moved on.

446
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,608
I sometimes wished
I could do the same.

447
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:29,845
Good afternoon.
So, what looks good today?

448
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:31,826
The key lime pie, please.

449
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:33,703
A small slice.

450
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:36,727
And a coffee, please.
Skim milk, please.

451
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:41,107
Orchids. I love orchids.

452
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:42,879
Cool. That's....

453
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:49,970
Well, I'll be right back with your pie.

454
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:03,838
I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to come to an orchid show.

455
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:06,445
I think these flowers are so sexy.

456
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:10,199
Let's see what's around back.

457
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,494
What?

458
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,518
- You wanna hear my pitch?
- Go away, goddamn it.

459
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,211
You know, I'm just trying
to do something.

460
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:49,614
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

461
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,804
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

462
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,723
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

463
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:58,998
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

464
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:01,710
He's already holding her hostage
in his creepy basement.

465
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,421
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity...

466
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,923
...and in the process
falls in love with her.

467
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:10,051
Even though he's never even met her.
She becomes like....

468
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:13,492
Like the unattainable.
Like the Holy Grail.

469
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:17,246
- It's a little obvious, don't you think?
- Okay, but here's the twist.

470
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:19,540
We find out that the killer...

471
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:22,773
...really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

472
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:26,527
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

473
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:29,863
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

474
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:36,120
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

475
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:38,518
On top of that, you explore
the notion...

476
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:41,855
...that cop and criminal are
really two aspects of the same person.

477
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:44,983
See every cop movie ever made
for other examples of this.

478
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,798
Mom called it psychologically taut.

479
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:51,865
The other thing is, there's no way
to write this. Did you consider that?

480
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:56,557
I mean, how could you have somebody
held prisoner in a basement...

481
00:31:56,453 --> 00:32:00,728
...and working in a police station
at the same time?

482
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:04,690
- Trick photography.
- Okay, that's not what I'm asking.

483
00:32:04,795 --> 00:32:07,714
Listen closely.
What I'm asking is:

484
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,719
In the reality of this movie, where
there's only one character, right?

485
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:14,284
Okay?

486
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:16,473
How could you...?

487
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,227
What exactly would...?

488
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,085
I agree with Mom. Very taut.

489
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,213
Sybil meets, I don't know....
Dressed to Kill.

490
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,612
Cool. I really liked Dressed to Kill.

491
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:34,095
- Until the third act denouement.
- That's not how it's pronounced.

492
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,745
Sorry. I--
Okay, sorry.

493
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,547
- Some key lime pie for you today?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

494
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:50,362
I'll cut you an extra-large slice.
Preferred customer.

495
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:54,220
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
- Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?

496
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:57,870
- Still reading about orchids, I hope?
- Yes, I am.

497
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,894
This friend of mine
has this little, tiny pink one...

498
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:04,230
...that grows on a tree branch
just like that.

499
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,420
- I can't remember--
- That's called an epiphyte.

500
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:08,714
Right. Right!

501
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:10,382
Boy, you know your stuff.

502
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:13,928
No, not really. I'm just learning.

503
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,952
Epiphytes grow on trees,
but they're not parasites.

504
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:19,663
They get all their nourishment
from the air and the rain.

505
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:23,938
Well, I'm impressed. That's great.

506
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:27,170
There are more than 30,000 kinds
of orchids in the world.

507
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:30,924
- Wow, that's a lot, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,175
Yeah.

509
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:37,702
So I'll be right back with an extra-large
slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

510
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:41,143
But-- So anyway,
I was also wondering....

511
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:47,295
I'm going up to Santa Barbara this
Saturday for an orchid show, and I....

512
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,362
- I'm sorry.
- Well....

513
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,428
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- So I'll just be right back with your pie.

514
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,922
There are more than 30,000
known orchid species.

515
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,321
One looks like a turtle.

516
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,344
One looks like a monkey.

517
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:18,368
One looks like an onion.

518
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:20,454
One looks like a schoolteacher.

519
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,435
One looks like a gymnast.

520
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,563
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin.

521
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:28,066
One looks like a New York
intellectual...

522
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,298
...with whom you do the Sunday
Times crossword puzzle in bed.

523
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,114
One looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen.

524
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:36,512
One looks like Amelia.

525
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,389
One has eyes that dance.

526
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,351
One has eyes that contain
the sadness of the world.

527
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,589
So I got married,
and me and my beautiful new wife...

528
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:53,717
...my now ex-wife, the bitch...

529
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,741
...opened up a nursery.

530
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:59,973
People started coming out
of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

531
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:03,727
...and admire my plants
and admire me.

532
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:10,296
I think some people were really spending
time with me because they were lonely.

533
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,159
And you know why I like plants?

534
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:24,373
Because they're so mutable.

535
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,482
Adaptation's a profound process.

536
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,359
It means you...

537
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:35,009
...figure out how to thrive in the world.

538
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:42,517
Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
I mean...

539
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,394
...they have no memory.

540
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:49,711
You know, they just move on to
whatever's next. But a person, now...

541
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:54,508
...adapting's almost shameful.
I mean, it's like...

542
00:35:54,508 --> 00:35:57,011
...running away.

543
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,819
Keener!

544
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,000
Hey, man.

545
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,503
Please don't hit
on crew members, Donald.

546
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:54,569
What, the makeup girl?
She was hitting on me, bro.

547
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:58,010
Don't embarrass me.
I have to work with these people.

548
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,451
I won't. Anyway, listen...

549
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:05,518
...I meant to ask you,
I need a cool way to kill people.

550
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:10,314
Don't worry. For my script.

551
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,504
I don't write that kind of stuff.

552
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,467
Come on, man, please?
You're the genius.

553
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,220
Here you go: The killer's
a literature professor.

554
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:24,287
He cuts off little chunks from his
victim's bodies until they die.

555
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,728
He calls himself
"The Deconstructionist."

556
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:33,359
- That's kind of good. I like that.
- See, I was kidding, Donald.

557
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,008
Okay. Sorry.

558
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:39,302
You got me.

559
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:43,682
Do you mind if I use it, though?

560
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:55,048
- It's really good.
- I tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

561
00:37:54,943 --> 00:37:58,384
- ...from the beginning to the end.
- I saw that. Why did you do that?

562
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:02,451
Because I wanted there to be more
tension. And then you pick it up later....

563
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:05,058
- But are you changing...?
- Keeps more tension.

564
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:08,812
That way the audience
gets stuck early on.

565
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,001
- You like it?
- I really like it.

566
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:22,993
You look hot tonight, baby.

567
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:27,268
Thanks, Donald.
That's swell of you to say.

568
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:31,439
- Don't you think she's hot, bro?
- I'm heading home, Donald.

569
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:33,524
Really? Come on.

570
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:36,444
Hey, it's Amelia.

571
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,425
Hey, Amelia!

572
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:42,179
Hey, Donald.
Hey, Charlie.

573
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,393
- Hey. Hi there.
- God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

574
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:51,355
- It's good to see you.
- This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

575
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,066
- She's a makeup artist for the movies.
- Hi.

576
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:57,090
Hi.

577
00:38:57,194 --> 00:38:58,863
This is David, my friend.

578
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,991
- Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

579
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,806
- Amelia's talked a lot about you.
- Hi, I'm Donald.

580
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,517
- Hey.
- Caroline.

581
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:09,186
- Cool camera.
- So how are you?

582
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:13,148
- You know me, a mess.
- Charlie...

583
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,755
...it's really good to see you.
Is the work good?

584
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,049
It's a disaster.
I don't know what I'm doing.

585
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:20,864
But, anyway, it's my problem.
I don't want to bore you.

586
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:24,826
You have your own stuff, right? I mean,
we both have our own separate stuff.

587
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:27,746
Anyway, I should go. I was just
heading home to do some work.

588
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,291
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

589
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,211
A little push, push in the bush.

590
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:37,756
Donald, you're such a tard!

591
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,633
See you, Charlie.

592
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:47,037
To write about a flower,
to dramatize a flower...

593
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:49,122
...I have to show the flower's arc.

594
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:52,459
And the flower's arc stretches back
to the beginning of life.

595
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:55,796
How did this flower get here?
What was its journey?

596
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:59,445
Therefore, I should infer
from analogy...

597
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:05,701
...that probably all the organic beings
which have ever lived on this Earth...

598
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:11,124
...have descended
from some one primordial form...

599
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:14,148
...into which life was first breathed.

600
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:17,172
It is a journey of evolution.
Adaptation.

601
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:21,551
The journey we all take. A journey
that unites each and every one of us.

602
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:25,096
Darwin writes that we all come
from the very first single-cell organism.

603
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:26,869
Yet here I am.

604
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:29,789
And there's Laroche.
There's Orlean.

605
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:33,542
And there's the ghost orchid.
All trapped in our own bodies...

606
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:36,879
...in moments in history.
That's it.

607
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:41,154
That's what I need to do.
Tie all of history together.

608
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:45,638
Start right before
life begins on the planet.

609
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,098
All is...

610
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:50,122
...lifeless.
And then, like, life begins...

611
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:52,416
...with organisms.
Those little single-cell ones.

612
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,544
And it's before sex, because,
like, everything was asexual.

613
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:58,151
From there we go to bigger things.
Jellyfish.

614
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,966
Then that fish that got legs
and crawled out on the land.

615
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,511
And then we see,
you know, like, dinosaurs.

616
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:09,412
And then they're around for a long time.
Then an asteroid comes and:

617
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:12,645
--the insects, the mammals,
the primates, monkeys.

618
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:16,399
The simple monkeys. Old-fashioned
monkeys giving way to the new ones.

619
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:18,901
Whatever. And then apes.
Whatever. And man.

620
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:23,698
Then we see the whole history of
human civilization: hunting, war, love...

621
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,887
...heartache, disease,
loneliness, technology.

622
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:30,058
And we end with Susan Orlean
in her office at The New Yorker...

623
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:32,665
...writing about flowers, and bang!
The movie begins.

624
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:36,523
This is the breakthrough I've been
hoping for. It's never been done.

625
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:39,651
McKee is a genius!

626
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:44,969
And hilarious. He just comes up with all
these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

627
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:48,098
But he's serious too, Charles.
You'd love him.

628
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:51,121
He's all for originality, just like you.

629
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:55,292
But he says we have to realize
that we all write in a genre...

630
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:58,525
...and we must find our originality
within that genre.

631
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:04,156
There hasn't been a new genre since
Fellini invented the mockumentary.

632
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,075
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

633
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:11,350
You and I share the same DNA.

634
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:14,896
Is there anything more lonely than that?

635
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:16,251
What'd you say, bro?

636
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,697
- Yeah?
- Hey.

637
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:27,617
Hey, Susie-Q.

638
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:28,764
What you up to?

639
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:33,352
I don't wanna bother you. Just thought
I'd call and get some more info.

640
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:38,670
I think you say some
pretty smart things, John.

641
00:42:38,774 --> 00:42:40,755
Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh?

642
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:45,865
So...

643
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:48,889
...whatever happened
to your nursery?

644
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,728
It was going pretty well.

645
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:59,837
But, you know, sometimes bad
things happen, darkness descends.

646
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,890
Nursery business good, Johnny?

647
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,289
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

648
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,895
This last year's been a dream.

649
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,919
I'm telling you.
Finally pulling out of debt.

650
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:22,152
Amen, honey.
I'm so proud of you two, and--

651
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:41,129
No, ma'am. I'm sorry,
I can't answer that.

652
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,902
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

653
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,281
- Hold it. Which ones are dead?
- Sir, please, don't move.

654
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:51,452
- Which ones are dead?
- Let's move it!

655
00:43:54,998 --> 00:44:00,003
I killed my mom, you know,
and my uncle.

656
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:03,965
That's how I lost my front teeth.

657
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:11,056
And my wife was in a coma
for, like, three weeks.

658
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:15,539
And she divorced me soon after
she regained consciousness.

659
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:34,726
Well, I think if I almost died,
I would leave my marriage too.

660
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:38,479
Why?

661
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:41,295
Because I could.

662
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:45,466
Because it's like a free pass.
Nobody can judge you...

663
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,115
...if you almost died.

664
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:51,931
Well, I judged her.

665
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:55,267
Maybe I was being judged too.

666
00:44:57,144 --> 00:45:01,941
It was like a month after that, Hurricane
Andrew came along and just...

667
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:04,443
...swooped down
like an angel of God...

668
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:10,387
...and just wiped out everything
I had left.

669
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:13,828
Everything.

670
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:17,582
I knew it'd break my heart
to start another nursery...

671
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:20,606
...so, you know,
when the Seminoles called...

672
00:45:20,606 --> 00:45:26,341
...they wanted a white guy or an expert
to get their nursery going, I took the job.

673
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:31,450
I wasn't gonna give them a
conventional little potted-plant place.

674
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:34,266
I was gonna give them something...

675
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,185
...amazing, you know?

676
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:40,522
Yeah, I know, John.

677
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,024
I know.

678
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,944
"I was going to give them
something amazing."

679
00:45:48,238 --> 00:45:51,471
It's beautifully written.
You have such a unique voice.

680
00:45:51,471 --> 00:45:54,286
Thank you very much.

681
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:57,518
- We're big fans.
- Thank you.

682
00:45:57,623 --> 00:46:00,334
Laroche is such a fun character.

683
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,775
- Yeah.
- It's funny and fresh.

684
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:06,486
And sad in a way.

685
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,676
So we were wondering what's next.

686
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,908
Well, Random House has asked me...

687
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:14,723
...to expand it into a book,
so I'm gonna be doing that.

688
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:17,956
- And--
- Susan, we would like to option this.

689
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:23,587
- You wanna make it into a movie?
- Into a movie.

690
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:25,359
Oh, God!

691
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:29,426
- That's really....
- How does that sound?

692
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:31,407
- That's very exciting.
- Good.

693
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:35,682
It's just comical. I hadn't thought of it.
I've never written a screenplay before.

694
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:39,749
Don't worry about that. We have
screenwriters to write the screenplay.

695
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:46,527
Hey, superstar.
It's Marty, super agent.

696
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:49,655
I just wanna remind you
it's been 13 weeks...

697
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:51,636
...and Valerie's anxious
to see a draft.

698
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,973
So if you could wrap things up and
get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

699
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:58,622
Call me when you get this.
Adios, amigo.

700
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,651
What? What'd you laugh at?

701
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,780
- You're a genius.
- Which line?

702
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:11,552
You're a genius.
You're a genius.

703
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,436
"We see orchid hunter
Augustus Margary.

704
00:47:40,436 --> 00:47:45,128
He wears a filthy, spittle-soaked
rag around his head to quell the pain.

705
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:48,986
The back of his trousers are stained
greasy black from an anal leakage...

706
00:47:48,986 --> 00:47:50,655
...due to dysentery.

707
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:56,702
He moans with each tentative step
through the overgrown jungle."

708
00:47:56,598 --> 00:47:58,162
I'm fucked.

709
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:02,542
We open with Laroche. He's funny.
He says, "I love to mutate plants."

710
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:05,566
He says, "Mutation is fun."
Okay, we show flowers and.... Okay.

711
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,547
We have to have the court case.
We show Laroche.

712
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,466
He says, "I was mutated as a baby.
That's why I'm so smart."

713
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:13,490
That's funny. Okay, we open
at the beginning of time. No!

714
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:15,993
- Laroche is driving into the swamp.
- Crazy white man!

715
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,212
I don't know how to adapt this.
I should have stuck with my own stuff.

716
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,506
I don't know why I thought
I could write this.

717
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,757
See her?

718
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,198
I fucked her up the ass.

719
00:48:33,198 --> 00:48:35,388
No. I'm kidding.

720
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:40,080
Maybe I can help.

721
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:48,839
It's about flowers.

722
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,550
Okay.

723
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:56,346
But it's not only about flowers, right?
You have the crazy plant-nut guy, right?

724
00:48:56,346 --> 00:48:58,745
He's funny. Right?

725
00:49:02,394 --> 00:49:05,940
"There's not nearly enough of him
to fill a book."

726
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:11,049
So Orlean "digresses in long
passages." Blah, blah, blah.

727
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,760
"No narrative unites these passages."
New York Times Book Review.

728
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,618
I can't structure this. It's that
sprawling New Yorker shit.

729
00:49:17,618 --> 00:49:19,808
Man, I'd fuck her up the ass.

730
00:49:22,206 --> 00:49:25,230
- Sorry.
- The book has no story. There's no story.

731
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:27,316
All right. Make one up.

732
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,382
I mean, nobody in this town
can make up a crazy story like you.

733
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:35,553
- You're the king of that.
- No, I didn't want to do that this time.

734
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:40,245
It's someone else's material.
I have a responsibility to Susan--

735
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:44,521
Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.
I wanted to do something simple.

736
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:47,857
Show people how amazing
flowers are.

737
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,151
Are they amazing?

738
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,199
I don't know. I think they are.

739
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:02,664
- I need you to get me out of this.
- All right.

740
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,835
Charlie, you've been stringing
them along for months now.

741
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:11,736
Not to give them anything at this
point would be a terrible career move.

742
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:22,059
Hey, my script's going amazing.

743
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:24,561
Right now, I'm working out
an image system.

744
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:27,898
Because of my multiple personality
theme, I've chosen a motif...

745
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:32,069
...of broken mirrors to show my
protagonist's fragmented self.

746
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:36,553
Bob says an image system increases
the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

747
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,847
- Bob says--
- You sound like you're in a cult.

748
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:42,183
No, it's just good writing technique.

749
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:45,520
I made you a copy
of McKee's 10 Commandments.

750
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:48,231
I posted one over
both our work areas.

751
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,014
You shouldn't have done that.

752
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,375
Because it's extremely helpful.
Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.

753
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,730
"Happy Together."

754
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:10,963
Like when characters sing songs
in their pajamas and dance around.

755
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,840
I thought it'd break the tension.

756
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,385
At first I was nervous
about putting a song in a thriller...

757
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:21,182
...but Bob says that Casablanca, one of
the greatest screenplays ever written...

758
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,414
...did exactly that.
Mixed genres.

759
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,708
I haven't slept in a week, Donald.

760
00:51:26,812 --> 00:51:29,836
- I need to go to bed.
- Okay.

761
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:32,234
Good night.

762
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,889
- Yeah?
- Hi.

763
00:51:40,993 --> 00:51:43,079
John, it's Susan again.

764
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,311
Hey, Susie-Q.

765
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,127
How's it going?

766
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:52,568
Great. I'm training myself
on the Internet.

767
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,383
It's fascinating.
I'm doing pornography.

768
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:59,658
It's amazing how much these suckers
will pay for photographs of chicks.

769
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,725
It doesn't matter if they're fat
or ugly or what.

770
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,393
Well, that sounds good.

771
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,313
It's great, is what it is.

772
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:13,005
Listen, John, I hate feeling like
I'm being a pain to you, but I....

773
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:14,882
I still haven't seen a ghost.

774
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:19,887
- Yeah?
- And I was hoping maybe you'd....

775
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:21,139
Yeah.

776
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,120
Yeah, I'll take you in.

777
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:26,144
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

778
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:30,419
Thank you so much.

779
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,087
Oh, John.

780
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,798
Damn it.

781
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:50,126
There are too many ideas
and things and people.

782
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:52,212
Too many directions to go.

783
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:57,217
I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care about something...

784
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:59,511
...is that it whittles the world down...

785
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:03,369
...to a more manageable size.

786
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:07,331
Such sweet, sad insights.

787
00:53:08,374 --> 00:53:10,877
So true.

788
00:53:23,807 --> 00:53:26,830
I like looking at you.

789
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:31,106
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

790
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,729
I don't know how to do this.

791
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:14,275
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

792
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:17,611
You've written a beautiful book.

793
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:20,427
I can't sleep.

794
00:54:21,782 --> 00:54:25,015
I'm losing my hair.
I'm fat and repulsive.

795
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,769
Shh. You're not. You're not.

796
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:34,504
Just whittle it down, you know?

797
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,006
Focus on one thing in the story.

798
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:40,239
Find that one thing...

799
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,784
...that you care passionately about...

800
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,974
...and then write about that.

801
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:49,415
We see Susan Orlean:
delicate, haunted by loneliness...

802
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,083
...fragile, beautiful.

803
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:55,150
She lies awake next to her sleeping,
insensitive husband.

804
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:56,505
Her voice-over begins:

805
00:54:56,922 --> 00:55:00,885
"I suppose I do
have one unembarrassed passion.

806
00:55:01,302 --> 00:55:05,577
I want to know how it feels to care
about something passionately."

807
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,416
- Hey.
- Morning.

808
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,213
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

809
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:21,009
- You seem chipper.
- I'm good. I have some new ideas.

810
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:26,119
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

811
00:55:26,014 --> 00:55:30,915
- I got some ideas too this morning.
- He got really, really good ones.

812
00:55:30,915 --> 00:55:33,314
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

813
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:36,129
I'm putting--
Hey! What?

814
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:41,343
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

815
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:44,888
...flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

816
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,703
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

817
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:50,623
Like technology versus horse.

818
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:53,125
And they're still all one person, right?

819
00:55:53,647 --> 00:55:55,836
Well, that's the big payoff.

820
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:58,756
- It sounds exciting.
- Thanks, man.

821
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:01,884
- Thanks.
- See, I told you he was gonna like it.

822
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:07,411
- You're my muse. You are.
- I love being your muse.

823
00:56:07,724 --> 00:56:10,330
I'm so happy about that.

824
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:14,189
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

825
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:34,417
- Valerie.
- Hi, Charlie.

826
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:36,503
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

827
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:39,318
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

828
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,404
- That's okay.
- I meant to because...

829
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:44,011
...things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

830
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:46,409
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.

831
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:49,120
You should sit down because
I'm here with Susan right now.

832
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,935
And she's dying to meet you,
so it's funny bumping into you.

833
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,395
- Have a seat.
- Susan Orlean is here?

834
00:56:53,499 --> 00:56:58,609
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading
or something. She's just on the phone.

835
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:02,258
Sit down. Have a seat.
She's dying to meet you.

836
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:07,681
Well, I should probably go, because....

837
00:57:07,681 --> 00:57:09,557
Well, I'd love to meet her too...

838
00:57:09,662 --> 00:57:12,790
...but I don't want to be beholden.
And, well--

839
00:57:12,894 --> 00:57:15,918
Because once you meet somebody
that you've been writing about...

840
00:57:15,918 --> 00:57:18,421
...it becomes very hard to separate.
So....

841
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:21,236
Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.
And I'm almost done.

842
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,383
I'm almost done.

843
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:25,615
And tell Susan that I would
love to meet with her at a future date.

844
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:27,388
- As she sees fit.
- Okay.

845
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:32,915
Who am I kidding?
This is not Susan Orlean's story.

846
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:35,626
I have no connection with her.
I can't even meet her.

847
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:38,858
I have no understanding of anything
but my own panic and self-loathing...

848
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,422
...and pathetic, little existence.

849
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:44,802
The only thing I'm actually qualified to
write about is myself and my own self--

850
00:57:44,697 --> 00:57:46,366
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

851
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,537
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in
a Hollywood restaurant...

852
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:55,855
...across from Valerie Thomas,
a lovely, statuesque film executive.

853
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,670
Kaufman, trying to get
a writing assignment...

854
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:01,902
...wanting to impress her,
sweats profusely.

855
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:10,661
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously
in his bedroom.

856
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:14,207
He speaks into his hand-held
tape recorder, and he says:

857
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:19,003
"Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,
repulsive, old...

858
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:21,714
...sits at a Hollywood restaurant
with Valerie Thomas."

859
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:23,591
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

860
00:58:23,696 --> 00:58:26,094
...jerks off to the book jacket photo
of Susan Or--

861
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:27,971
What do you want?

862
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,743
I've finished my script.

863
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,933
I'm done.

864
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,834
So would you show it to your agent?

865
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,275
It's called The Three.

866
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,157
Thanks. I also want to
thank you for your idea.

867
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:49,451
It was very helpful.
I changed it a little.

868
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:53,309
Now the killer cuts off body pieces
and makes his victims eat them.

869
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:56,750
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake
swallowing its own tail, and--

870
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,982
- Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that means.

871
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:02,276
The snake. It's called Ourobouros.

872
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:05,822
I don't think so. But it's cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi...

873
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:08,846
...because when he forces the woman
who's really him to eat herself...

874
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,723
...he's also eating himself to death.

875
00:59:10,723 --> 00:59:12,182
I'm insane.

876
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,519
- I'm Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that word means.

877
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,482
- I've written myself into my screenplay.
- That's kind of weird, huh?

878
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:22,505
It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

879
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,112
It's solipsistic. It's pathetic.

880
00:59:25,217 --> 00:59:27,302
I'm pathetic.
I'm fat and pathetic.

881
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:31,056
I'm sure you had good reasons, Charles.
You're an artist.

882
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:34,393
It's because I'm too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book.

883
00:59:34,393 --> 00:59:36,374
Because I'm pathetic.

884
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:40,649
Because I have no idea how to write.
Because I can't make flowers fascinating.

885
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,630
Because I suck.

886
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,967
- Hey, am I in the script?
- I'm going to New York.

887
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:49,512
I'll meet her. That's it.
That's what I have to do.

888
00:59:49,616 --> 00:59:51,389
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

889
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:53,787
...but Bob's having a seminar
in New York this weekend.

890
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:55,769
So if you're stuck....

891
00:59:56,498 --> 01:00:00,669
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

892
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:03,068
No shit, I'm a fun character.

893
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:04,423
Who's gonna play me?

894
01:00:04,527 --> 01:00:06,821
Well, I've gotta write
the book first, John.

895
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:09,845
Then, you know, they get somebody
to write the screenplay.

896
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:12,139
Hey, I think I should play me.

897
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:17,979
Most people yearn for something
exceptional, something so inspiring...

898
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:23,297
...that they'd want to risk everything
for that passion, but few would act on it.

899
01:00:23,297 --> 01:00:26,529
It was very powerful...

900
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:31,117
...and it's intoxicating to be
around someone so alive.

901
01:00:31,117 --> 01:00:34,141
Come on, just follow me.
They're right nearby.

902
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:35,914
Okay.

903
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:49,365
Can I ask you a personal question?

904
01:00:49,469 --> 01:00:52,284
Look, we're not lost.

905
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:15,224
I've done this a million times.

906
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:19,708
When everything is killing me, I just say,
"Screw it," and go straight ahead.

907
01:01:28,571 --> 01:01:30,240
Oh, fuck....

908
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:37,226
Sundial.

909
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:41,397
I'll just set this up,
we'll wait a few minutes...

910
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:44,734
...and then we'll be able to tell
which way the sun's moving.

911
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,445
We should be headed southeast.

912
01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:55,265
So, you collect anything?

913
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:57,142
Not really, no.

914
01:01:57,872 --> 01:02:00,270
Yeah, well, you know...

915
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,190
...it's not really about
collecting the thing.

916
01:02:03,294 --> 01:02:06,840
It's about being able....

917
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:11,636
The thing about computers,
the thing I like...

918
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,305
...is that I'm immersed in them...

919
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:18,310
...but it's not like a living thing
that's gonna leave or die or something.

920
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:27,903
- John, I'm sorry. I just--
- Okay.

921
01:02:28,633 --> 01:02:30,718
- I don't--
- Hey. Okay.

922
01:02:30,718 --> 01:02:32,491
Fuck the sundial.

923
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:35,619
I know how to get out of here.
I know how to get out of here.

924
01:02:35,723 --> 01:02:38,747
I know this swamp like
the back of my goddamn hand.

925
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:41,458
You're just like everybody else.
Fucking leeches.

926
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:45,629
You just attach yourself to me
and suck me dry, spit me out.

927
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:49,174
Why don't you get your own fucking life?
Your own fucking interests?

928
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,677
Fucking spoiled bitch.

929
01:02:56,891 --> 01:03:02,730
Life seemed to be filled with things
that were just like the ghost orchid.

930
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:07,318
Wonderful to imagine
and easy to fall in love with...

931
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,238
...but a little fantastic...

932
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:12,323
...and fleeting...

933
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,721
...and out of reach.

934
01:03:26,921 --> 01:03:31,405
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

935
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,863
Hello?

936
01:05:12,863 --> 01:05:14,948
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

937
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,972
Has it been helpful talking to the writer?
What's her name?

938
01:05:18,076 --> 01:05:20,474
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

939
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:24,124
Well, I mean, are you making headway?

940
01:05:24,228 --> 01:05:26,314
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

941
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:31,215
- You can't rush inspiration.
- Okay. All right. Fair enough.

942
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:34,864
Listen, the other reason
I called was The Three.

943
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:36,950
It's just amazing.

944
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:40,182
- I don't know what that is.
- Donald's script.

945
01:05:40,286 --> 01:05:44,144
A smart, edgy thriller.
It's the best script I've read all year.

946
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:53,112
- Good.
- Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

947
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:56,031
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

948
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:59,890
In fact, maybe you could get your
brother to help you with the orchid thing.

949
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:04,790
- Marty, don't say that. I mean--
- All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

950
01:06:04,686 --> 01:06:08,440
I mean, he's really
goddamn amazing at structure.

951
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,838
- I have to go.
- All right. Adios, amigo.

952
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:12,194
Finish that--

953
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,033
Fuck!

954
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:29,816
Okay, thank you, thank you.

955
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,736
We have a long three days ahead.

956
01:06:32,736 --> 01:06:37,428
Years from now, you'll be at a posh
cocktail party congratulating yourself...

957
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:43,476
...on how you spent a weekend with
an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

958
01:06:43,684 --> 01:06:46,812
- I am pathetic. I am a loser.
- So...

959
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,315
...what is the substance of writing?

960
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:52,860
I have failed. I am panicked.
I have sold out. I am worthless.

961
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,676
l-- What the fuck am I doing here?

962
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,865
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

963
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:02,349
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack
of conviction that brings me here.

964
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:05,373
Easy answers,
rules to shortcut yourself to success.

965
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:08,814
And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing.

966
01:07:08,814 --> 01:07:12,046
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes
for attempting something new?

967
01:07:12,046 --> 01:07:16,009
I should leave right now. I'll start over.
I need to face this project head-on--

968
01:07:16,113 --> 01:07:19,763
And God help you if you use
voice-over in your work, my friends.

969
01:07:19,658 --> 01:07:23,412
God help you.
It's flaccid, sloppy writing.

970
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:28,522
Any idiot can write voice-over narration
to explain the thoughts of the character.

971
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:30,399
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

972
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:37,489
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

973
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:41,451
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

974
01:07:42,286 --> 01:07:45,101
You follow? Good.

975
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,812
Anyone else?

976
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:56,884
What if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens?

977
01:07:56,884 --> 01:08:00,325
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

978
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:04,391
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

979
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:06,581
More a reflection of the real world.

980
01:08:07,103 --> 01:08:08,875
The real world?

981
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:10,648
Yes, sir.

982
01:08:10,648 --> 01:08:12,942
The real fucking world.

983
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:16,800
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis...

984
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:19,198
...you'll bore your audience to tears.

985
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,161
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

986
01:08:23,995 --> 01:08:26,914
Are you out of your fucking mind?

987
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:29,834
People are murdered every day.

988
01:08:30,251 --> 01:08:33,275
There's genocide, war, corruption.

989
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,090
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world...

990
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:38,593
...somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody else.

991
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:42,243
Every fucking day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision...

992
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,745
...to destroy someone else.

993
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:47,248
People find love. People lose it.

994
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:52,044
Christ, a child watches a mother
beaten to death on the steps of a church.

995
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,608
Someone goes hungry.

996
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:57,154
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

997
01:08:57,571 --> 01:09:00,073
If you can't find that stuff in life...

998
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:03,514
...then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

999
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:09,562
And why the fuck are you wasting
my two precious hours with your movie?

1000
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:12,273
I don't have any use for it!

1001
01:09:12,377 --> 01:09:16,236
I don't have any bloody use for it!

1002
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,259
Okay, thanks.

1003
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,473
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1004
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:25,933
No. Thank you.

1005
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,123
Thank you so much, Mr.McKee.

1006
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,336
This course makes you look at writing
in a whole different way.

1007
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,777
- Mr.McKee.
- Yes?

1008
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:40,323
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

1009
01:09:41,782 --> 01:09:43,138
I need more.

1010
01:09:43,242 --> 01:09:46,892
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

1011
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:49,603
Right. Okay.

1012
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:52,001
- Nice to see you.
- I need to talk.

1013
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:56,381
Mr.McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

1014
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:57,840
I don't meet people well.

1015
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,552
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

1016
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:02,950
What you said was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

1017
01:10:03,054 --> 01:10:06,495
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

1018
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:10,979
Yeah.

1019
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:13,481
Well, you know...

1020
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:16,401
...I could sure use a drink, my friend.

1021
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:22,449
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

1022
01:10:22,449 --> 01:10:24,430
Then what happens?

1023
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:28,288
Well, that's the end of the book.

1024
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,061
I wanted to present it simply...

1025
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:33,189
...without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

1026
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:35,483
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

1027
01:10:35,587 --> 01:10:39,654
I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

1028
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,322
It was about disappointment.

1029
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:44,972
I see.

1030
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:47,996
That's not a movie.

1031
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:51,750
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

1032
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:58,214
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

1033
01:10:58,214 --> 01:11:01,447
- I'm way past my deadline.
- I'll tell you a secret.

1034
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:05,931
A last act makes a film.

1035
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,997
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

1036
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:13,960
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end...

1037
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:16,358
...and you've got a hit.

1038
01:11:17,192 --> 01:11:20,946
Find an ending.
But don't cheat.

1039
01:11:20,842 --> 01:11:24,387
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

1040
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:29,184
Your characters must change...

1041
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:33,042
...and the change must come from them.

1042
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:38,568
Do that and you'll be fine.

1043
01:11:40,341 --> 01:11:42,009
You promise?

1044
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:46,910
Mr.McKee.

1045
01:11:49,725 --> 01:11:52,645
- Have you taken my course before?
- My brother did.

1046
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:56,294
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

1047
01:11:56,294 --> 01:11:58,693
- Twin screenwriters?
- Yeah.

1048
01:11:58,797 --> 01:12:02,864
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

1049
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:05,783
...who wrote Casablanca...

1050
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,912
- ...they were twins
- You mentioned that in class.

1051
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,727
Finest screenplay ever written.

1052
01:12:12,248 --> 01:12:13,917
Great writers' residence.

1053
01:12:14,021 --> 01:12:16,628
- Donald.
- Hey, how's your trip going?

1054
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:19,443
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog you?

1055
01:12:19,547 --> 01:12:20,694
Yeah.

1056
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:24,344
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

1057
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:29,349
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

1058
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:32,894
That's great, Donald.

1059
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:35,710
I want to thank you for all your help.

1060
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,482
I wasn't any help.

1061
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,881
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

1062
01:12:39,881 --> 01:12:43,113
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

1063
01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:45,928
It's been a wild ride.

1064
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,118
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

1065
01:12:48,222 --> 01:12:50,099
Oh, please!

1066
01:12:50,725 --> 01:12:52,289
Please, Donald?

1067
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:53,957
Catherine Keener?

1068
01:12:54,896 --> 01:12:58,024
- Catherine Keener's in my house?
- Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

1069
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:00,944
She's so great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

1070
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:03,655
Yeah. Look....

1071
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:06,679
I've been thinking.

1072
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:14,186
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging
out with me for a few days in New York.

1073
01:13:14,082 --> 01:13:16,272
Oh, my God, yes.

1074
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,523
Yeah?

1075
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:20,026
I was gonna show my script
to some people...

1076
01:13:20,026 --> 01:13:24,092
...and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

1077
01:13:24,092 --> 01:13:26,699
Of course. I'd be flattered.

1078
01:13:28,472 --> 01:13:29,932
Okay.

1079
01:13:30,036 --> 01:13:31,913
Thanks, Charles.

1080
01:13:32,017 --> 01:13:33,373
Okay, bye.

1081
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,326
So, like, what would you do?

1082
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:51,620
The script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

1083
01:13:51,725 --> 01:13:55,166
- I'm sorry. I was trying something--
- Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

1084
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,521
Good. Okay.

1085
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:59,232
So, what would you do?

1086
01:14:00,796 --> 01:14:04,342
You and me are so different, Charles.
We're different talents.

1087
01:14:04,237 --> 01:14:05,801
I know. Just for fun...

1088
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,304
...how would the great Donald
end this script?

1089
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:11,432
Shut up. "The great Donald."

1090
01:14:13,413 --> 01:14:15,395
I feel like you're missing something.

1091
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:19,044
- All right. Like what?
- Look.

1092
01:14:22,694 --> 01:14:25,092
I did a little research on the airplane.

1093
01:14:27,073 --> 01:14:30,514
"Sometimes this kind of story turns out
to be something more...

1094
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:33,017
...some glimpse of life that expands...

1095
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:36,041
...like those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water...

1096
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:39,794
...and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous...

1097
01:14:39,794 --> 01:14:43,027
...you can't believe there was a time
all you saw in front of you...

1098
01:14:43,027 --> 01:14:45,008
...was a paper ball and a glass of water."

1099
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:49,075
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care about flowers.

1100
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:52,516
- For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
- Well, but for what?

1101
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:56,687
What turned that paper ball into
a flower? It's not in the book, Charles.

1102
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:59,189
- I don't know. You're reaching.
- Maybe.

1103
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:03,777
But I think you actually need to speak
to this woman. To know her.

1104
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,801
I can't.

1105
01:15:08,365 --> 01:15:10,451
- Really.
- I'll go.

1106
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:12,432
I'll pretend I'm you.

1107
01:15:12,849 --> 01:15:14,309
I want to do it, Charles.

1108
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:18,271
We'll get to the bottom of this.
We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

1109
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:23,485
But you've gotta be exactly me.

1110
01:15:24,006 --> 01:15:26,196
I have a reputation to maintain.

1111
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,011
You can't be a goofball.
You can't be an asshole.

1112
01:15:29,116 --> 01:15:31,097
- I'm not an asshole.
- You know what I mean.

1113
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:34,746
No flirting. No bad jokes.

1114
01:15:34,642 --> 01:15:37,040
Don't laugh how you laugh.

1115
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,315
I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people think I'm you.

1116
01:15:41,315 --> 01:15:42,880
It's an honor.

1117
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:49,449
So I guess I'll bring out
the big guns now.

1118
01:15:50,596 --> 01:15:52,368
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

1119
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:59,876
I felt I detected an attraction to him
in the subtext. Care to comment?

1120
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:06,028
Well, our relationship
was strictly reporter-subject.

1121
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:12,493
I mean, certainly an intimacy does
evolve in this kind of relationship.

1122
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:17,081
By definition, I was so interested
in everything he had to say.

1123
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:21,356
But the relationship ends
when the book ends.

1124
01:16:25,736 --> 01:16:28,030
- Mendacious deceit.
- What?

1125
01:16:28,134 --> 01:16:29,490
Nothing.

1126
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:31,784
I just have one more question.

1127
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:39,083
If you could have dinner with one
historical personage, living or dead...

1128
01:16:39,187 --> 01:16:40,751
...who would it be?

1129
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:44,192
Well, I would have to say...

1130
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:47,425
...Einstein.

1131
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:49,823
Or Jesus.

1132
01:16:51,283 --> 01:16:53,160
Very good.

1133
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,724
Interesting answer.

1134
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,563
- She's lying.
- What do you mean?

1135
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,587
- What happened?
- Nothing. She said everything right.

1136
01:17:04,838 --> 01:17:08,488
- Too right.
- Well, maybe because they're true.

1137
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,052
Did you embarrass me?

1138
01:17:10,156 --> 01:17:12,346
People who answer questions
too right are liars.

1139
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,891
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein.
That's a prepackaged answer.

1140
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:19,332
- "Jesus and Einstein"?
- Listen, Charles, I have an idea.

1141
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:21,522
You'll need to buy me
a pair of binoculars.

1142
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:23,190
What's "Jesus and Einstein"?

1143
01:17:25,588 --> 01:17:26,944
Come on.

1144
01:17:29,655 --> 01:17:30,906
Sing with me.

1145
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:38,101
What the hell
do you need binoculars for?

1146
01:17:39,978 --> 01:17:41,959
Let's go, let's go.

1147
01:17:43,002 --> 01:17:45,713
She hung up the phone.
She's upset.

1148
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:47,799
Stop watching her.
Leave her alone.

1149
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,780
She's crying.

1150
01:17:51,135 --> 01:17:53,534
She's at her computer.

1151
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:55,619
This is morally reprehensible.

1152
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,496
United...

1153
01:17:58,017 --> 01:17:59,581
...to Miami.

1154
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:02,501
Eleven...

1155
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,421
...fifty-five a.m. tomorrow.

1156
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:09,279
- I thought she was done with Laroche.
- Her parents live in Florida.

1157
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:11,990
That was no parent phone call,
my friend.

1158
01:18:12,094 --> 01:18:13,450
Don't say "my friend."

1159
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:15,327
A guy entering.

1160
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:17,099
Handsome.

1161
01:18:20,227 --> 01:18:21,583
Must be her husband.

1162
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:24,920
She's acting weird
with him, though, right?

1163
01:18:25,441 --> 01:18:26,901
Don't you think?

1164
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:33,262
What's she hiding from him?

1165
01:18:35,868 --> 01:18:38,371
Maybe she's a lesbian
and doesn't know how to tell him.

1166
01:18:38,475 --> 01:18:39,831
What do you think?

1167
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:43,272
Have you checked out
Laroche's porn site?

1168
01:18:43,272 --> 01:18:45,357
No. I'm trying to read.

1169
01:18:45,357 --> 01:18:47,547
Anyway, I'm gonna look
at the porn site.

1170
01:18:47,547 --> 01:18:49,424
Research.

1171
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,135
- Don't tell my old lady.
- You mean Mom?

1172
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,908
No, I don't mean Mom.

1173
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:58,287
I still say we should go
to Miami tomorrow.

1174
01:18:58,287 --> 01:18:59,434
Forget it.

1175
01:18:59,538 --> 01:19:01,832
Some of these chicks look okay.

1176
01:19:01,832 --> 01:19:04,126
Hey, guess what.
We're going to Miami tomorrow.

1177
01:19:04,231 --> 01:19:08,193
- I said, no.
- I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

1178
01:19:27,275 --> 01:19:32,697
What I came to understand
is that change is not a choice.

1179
01:19:32,697 --> 01:19:36,868
Not for a species of plant,
and not for me.

1180
01:19:36,764 --> 01:19:40,935
It happens, and you are different.

1181
01:19:42,395 --> 01:19:45,314
Maybe the only distinction
between the plant and me...

1182
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:47,921
...is that afterward,
I lied about my change.

1183
01:19:48,025 --> 01:19:51,675
I lied in my book.
I pretended with my husband...

1184
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:54,594
...that everything was the same.

1185
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:58,348
But something happened
in the swamp that day.

1186
01:20:01,372 --> 01:20:02,728
Hey, look.

1187
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:06,273
I told you I'd find
the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

1188
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:13,885
It's a flower.

1189
01:20:15,345 --> 01:20:17,222
Just a flower.

1190
01:20:18,577 --> 01:20:20,663
Well, might as well grab it.

1191
01:20:20,767 --> 01:20:22,644
Long as I'm here.

1192
01:20:31,507 --> 01:20:32,654
Oh, man.

1193
01:20:41,726 --> 01:20:44,228
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

1194
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,717
Look, something I didn't tell you...

1195
01:20:53,717 --> 01:20:57,367
...that I want to tell you about the ghost.
Okay?

1196
01:20:58,931 --> 01:21:00,808
I think it might help you.

1197
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:05,291
I'd just started at the nursery.

1198
01:21:06,438 --> 01:21:09,254
And I went back one night
to pick up something.

1199
01:21:28,544 --> 01:21:31,673
They wanted the ghost
just to extract the drug.

1200
01:21:32,298 --> 01:21:34,175
It had been a ceremonial thing...

1201
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:37,199
...but the young guys, you know,
they liked to get stoned.

1202
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:38,763
So Matthew...?

1203
01:21:39,284 --> 01:21:41,057
- He was one of the guys who--?
- Sure.

1204
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:44,081
Matthew lived on that shit
till they ran out.

1205
01:21:44,081 --> 01:21:48,252
Because there was this one day
he was fascinated by me.

1206
01:21:48,252 --> 01:21:52,840
By my hair and my sadness.

1207
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,864
Yeah, well, it does that.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1208
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:01,807
I mean, I think you'd like it, Susie.
It seems to help people be fascinated.

1209
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,831
You know, I can extract it for you.
I know how. I watched.

1210
01:22:04,936 --> 01:22:07,751
I'm probably the only white guy
who knows.

1211
01:22:09,002 --> 01:22:10,566
I want to do this, Susie.

1212
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:16,301
I'm done with orchids, Laroche.

1213
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,137
- Hello?
- Hi.

1214
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:41,805
It's John.

1215
01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:44,308
Did you get my package?

1216
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:45,976
John?

1217
01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:48,583
John!

1218
01:23:50,043 --> 01:23:51,294
Johnny.

1219
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:55,465
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

1220
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,285
Very happy now.

1221
01:24:03,807 --> 01:24:05,371
Well, I'm glad.

1222
01:24:08,395 --> 01:24:09,750
Very happy.

1223
01:24:14,964 --> 01:24:16,632
Will you go like this--?

1224
01:24:26,955 --> 01:24:29,041
No. Keep going.

1225
01:24:35,506 --> 01:24:36,966
No. No.

1226
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:43,743
I'm trying to make a dial tone.
And you have to sustain.

1227
01:24:43,848 --> 01:24:46,454
And then I will join you, and together--

1228
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:49,895
- See, I can't do it by myself.
- Which one do you want me to do?

1229
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:54,379
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

1230
01:25:03,347 --> 01:25:05,224
- That's it.
- We got it.

1231
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:08,873
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

1232
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:14,295
Do you ever get
lonely sometimes, Johnny?

1233
01:25:15,547 --> 01:25:17,736
Well, I was a weird kid.

1234
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,073
Nobody liked me.

1235
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:24,827
But I had this idea...

1236
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,415
...if I waited long
enough, someone would...

1237
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,752
...come around and just...

1238
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,131
...you know, understand me.

1239
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:44,743
Like my mom.

1240
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,374
Except someone else.

1241
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:58,194
She'd look at me and quietly say:

1242
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:00,280
"Yes."

1243
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:04,451
Just like that.

1244
01:26:05,806 --> 01:26:09,560
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

1245
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,869
I wish I were an ant.

1246
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,832
They're so shiny.

1247
01:26:33,751 --> 01:26:35,941
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

1248
01:26:37,714 --> 01:26:41,676
That's the sweetest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

1249
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,032
Well...

1250
01:26:43,553 --> 01:26:45,534
...I like you, that's why.

1251
01:26:53,146 --> 01:26:54,397
Hey.

1252
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:37,253
I don't have time for that.

1253
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:53,103
I'll get a closer look. You wait here.

1254
01:28:00,402 --> 01:28:02,279
No, wait!

1255
01:28:04,573 --> 01:28:06,033
I should go.

1256
01:28:06,346 --> 01:28:09,161
I mean, it should be me, right?

1257
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:10,517
I mean...

1258
01:28:11,038 --> 01:28:12,393
...it's my....

1259
01:28:13,749 --> 01:28:15,417
- I was, you know--
- Go for it, bro.

1260
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:17,399
You're the man.

1261
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,048
Rip them.

1262
01:29:22,778 --> 01:29:24,237
Just rip them.

1263
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,472
Darling, I don't know
what's come over you.

1264
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:54,894
You came all over me last time
I was here, as I recall.

1265
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:23,465
Goddamn!

1266
01:30:23,569 --> 01:30:25,133
Hey! Fuck.

1267
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:27,740
Get in here!

1268
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,868
Shut the fuck up, now!
Sit the fuck down!

1269
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:33,475
- Who is that, Johnny?
- Who the fuck are you?

1270
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:35,352
I just--
Nobody.

1271
01:30:35,456 --> 01:30:39,314
- I just-- I'm just--
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1272
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:42,338
He's that screenwriter.

1273
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:47,134
- The guy that's adapting our book?
- Yeah.

1274
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:51,827
Well, that's wild.

1275
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:53,808
It's nice to meet you.

1276
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:57,770
Hey, dude...

1277
01:30:57,979 --> 01:31:02,150
- ...who's gonna play me?
- I don't know that. I should--

1278
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:04,340
Well, I thought I should play me.

1279
01:31:04,444 --> 01:31:05,695
Why--?

1280
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:08,615
- Did he follow me?
- No, of course not. I should go.

1281
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,056
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it was nice to meet you...

1282
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,350
...but let me give you my number.

1283
01:31:14,454 --> 01:31:17,791
I'm really freaking here, Johnny.
Why is he here?

1284
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:19,772
Why did he follow me?

1285
01:31:20,189 --> 01:31:23,421
- What does he know?
- I don't know anything about anything.

1286
01:31:23,526 --> 01:31:26,133
- He did see the greenhouse.
- Oh, shit.

1287
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:27,592
Oh, shit.

1288
01:31:28,009 --> 01:31:30,512
Are you gonna write about this
in your screenplay?

1289
01:31:30,512 --> 01:31:32,702
I really don't know what "this" is.

1290
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,873
He's lying.

1291
01:31:37,603 --> 01:31:39,584
- Hold him.
- Stay! Just--

1292
01:32:15,871 --> 01:32:17,435
We have to kill him.

1293
01:32:17,435 --> 01:32:19,416
- What?
- What are we supposed to do?

1294
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:21,084
- What can we do?
- Sit the fuck down!

1295
01:32:28,071 --> 01:32:29,635
Susie...

1296
01:32:29,948 --> 01:32:31,929
...you gotta calm down.

1297
01:32:31,929 --> 01:32:34,327
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

1298
01:32:34,431 --> 01:32:37,038
- You don't know--
- I can't have him writing about me.

1299
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:41,626
I can't have the whole world,
all the people knowing about us...

1300
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,607
...and about this.

1301
01:32:45,484 --> 01:32:47,048
Why?

1302
01:32:47,778 --> 01:32:50,072
- You ashamed of me, Susie?
- No, that's not it.

1303
01:32:50,177 --> 01:32:52,366
- No. How can you even think of that?
- Well--

1304
01:32:52,575 --> 01:32:55,912
I'm a professional journalist,
and the drugs and--

1305
01:32:58,518 --> 01:33:00,500
We can't kill anyone.

1306
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,585
Okay. Okay.

1307
01:33:02,689 --> 01:33:04,775
Then I'll do it.

1308
01:33:05,088 --> 01:33:06,652
By myself.

1309
01:33:06,756 --> 01:33:09,363
- Susan--
- Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

1310
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:12,074
- I wouldn't tell any--
- Put him in his fucking car!

1311
01:33:57,745 --> 01:34:00,665
Turn it off. Just get out.

1312
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:32,155
Run! Run! Go!

1313
01:34:33,824 --> 01:34:36,118
Susan! What the fuck was that?

1314
01:34:36,118 --> 01:34:41,749
- I don't know. I couldn't see.
- Shit. Fuck!

1315
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:44,355
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

1316
01:35:13,865 --> 01:35:16,471
So it was a guy?

1317
01:35:16,471 --> 01:35:20,121
Yeah. Fat.

1318
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:22,728
That's all I could tell.

1319
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:31,070
This is ridiculous.
We're gonna have to split up.

1320
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:36,596
I can't. I can't be by myself out here.
I'm not gonna do that.

1321
01:35:38,577 --> 01:35:41,706
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't think so.

1322
01:35:42,018 --> 01:35:45,876
I don't want to die, Donald.
I've wasted my life. God, I've wasted it.

1323
01:35:45,876 --> 01:35:49,839
- You did not. And you're not gonna die.
- I wasted it.

1324
01:35:49,943 --> 01:35:51,924
I admire you, Donald, you know?

1325
01:35:52,029 --> 01:35:55,782
I spent my whole life paralyzed,
worrying about what people think of me...

1326
01:35:55,678 --> 01:36:00,058
- ...and you, you're just oblivious.
- I'm not oblivious.

1327
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:04,333
No, you don't understand.
I mean that as a compliment.

1328
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,338
There was this time in high school.

1329
01:36:09,442 --> 01:36:12,570
I was watching you out
the library window...

1330
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:16,428
- ...you were talking to Sarah Marsh.
- Oh, God, I was so in love with her.

1331
01:36:16,533 --> 01:36:21,851
I know. And you were flirting with her,
and she was being really sweet to you.

1332
01:36:21,851 --> 01:36:25,813
- I remember that.
- And then, when you walked away...

1333
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,463
...she started making fun of you
with Kim Canetti.

1334
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:34,989
And it was like
they were laughing at me.

1335
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:38,951
You didn't know at all?

1336
01:36:40,307 --> 01:36:44,895
- You seemed so happy.
- I knew. I heard them.

1337
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,023
Well, how come you were so happy?

1338
01:36:49,796 --> 01:36:52,507
I loved Sarah, Charles.

1339
01:36:53,967 --> 01:36:59,076
It was mine, that love.

1340
01:37:00,536 --> 01:37:02,621
I owned it.

1341
01:37:05,332 --> 01:37:09,191
Even Sarah didn't have
the right to take it away.

1342
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:13,779
I can love whoever I want.

1343
01:37:16,073 --> 01:37:18,784
But she thought you were pathetic.

1344
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:25,770
That was her business, not mine.

1345
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:33,903
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1346
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:39,325
That's what I decided a long time ago.

1347
01:37:52,464 --> 01:37:54,445
What's up?

1348
01:37:56,322 --> 01:37:58,407
Thank you.

1349
01:37:59,554 --> 01:38:01,848
For what?

1350
01:38:11,129 --> 01:38:13,423
No, shh!

1351
01:38:13,631 --> 01:38:16,447
Listen. I hear them.

1352
01:38:16,551 --> 01:38:19,992
I hear them. I hear them breathing.

1353
01:38:25,518 --> 01:38:28,021
Charlie?

1354
01:38:29,064 --> 01:38:31,879
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

1355
01:38:31,775 --> 01:38:34,590
- Guys?
- Charlie!

1356
01:38:34,694 --> 01:38:36,467
Charlie!

1357
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,711
Where's the van?

1358
01:39:12,754 --> 01:39:17,759
- Are they gone?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1359
01:39:45,808 --> 01:39:47,998
John? John!

1360
01:39:56,549 --> 01:39:58,008
Shit!

1361
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:21,991
I can't believe I got shot.
Isn't that fucked up?

1362
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,285
Shut up. Stop laughing.

1363
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:56,818
Donald? You're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

1364
01:40:57,131 --> 01:41:01,615
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't
go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

1365
01:41:01,928 --> 01:41:04,430
Look at me, Donald.
Keep looking at me.

1366
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:07,663
Open your eyes.
Donald, please open your eyes.

1367
01:41:07,663 --> 01:41:11,417
Donald. Donald, please
open your eyes, Donald.

1368
01:41:11,521 --> 01:41:14,545
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

1369
01:41:36,233 --> 01:41:37,902
Look at me.

1370
01:41:51,874 --> 01:41:53,439
Help!

1371
01:42:02,823 --> 01:42:04,283
John!

1372
01:42:35,565 --> 01:42:37,129
Halt!

1373
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:09,454
I'm sorry.

1374
01:43:09,454 --> 01:43:12,165
Now I have to do this too.

1375
01:43:12,999 --> 01:43:15,397
I'm not a killer.

1376
01:43:17,378 --> 01:43:18,630
You put yourself in--

1377
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,407
Johnny!

1378
01:43:28,223 --> 01:43:30,204
- Help!
- No, no!

1379
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:37,607
Johnny! Johnny! John!

1380
01:43:50,954 --> 01:43:53,144
Oh, no, no, no.

1381
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:07,742
Oh, God. You fat piece of shit!

1382
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,809
- He's dead, you loser!
- Shut up!

1383
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:14,728
- You ruined my life, you fat fuck!
- Shut up! Shut up!

1384
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:20,985
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,
old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

1385
01:44:31,412 --> 01:44:34,644
Oh, my God.

1386
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:41,944
It's over. Everything's over.

1387
01:44:42,152 --> 01:44:44,550
I did everything wrong.

1388
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:50,598
I want my life back.

1389
01:44:50,703 --> 01:44:54,769
I want it back before it all got fucked up.

1390
01:44:54,665 --> 01:44:59,879
I want to be a baby again.
I want to be new.

1391
01:45:00,087 --> 01:45:03,215
I want to be new.

1392
01:45:35,227 --> 01:45:37,313
Hello?

1393
01:45:39,815 --> 01:45:42,422
- Hello?
- Mom.

1394
01:45:42,526 --> 01:45:47,427
Charles? Charles, is that you?

1395
01:45:51,911 --> 01:45:55,039
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

1396
01:46:16,415 --> 01:46:20,899
Donald says,
"That was her business, not mine.

1397
01:46:20,794 --> 01:46:24,757
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1398
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:28,198
I decided that a long time ago."

1399
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:31,222
Kaufman starts to cry.

1400
01:46:31,326 --> 01:46:36,227
He tries to thank his brother,
but he can't put it into words.

1401
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:42,066
- So how you getting on?
- I'm okay.

1402
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,758
I miss him, you know?

1403
01:46:49,157 --> 01:46:52,389
- How's the script coming?
- It's good. I'm almost finished.

1404
01:46:52,493 --> 01:46:55,100
I'll be really glad to move on
to something else.

1405
01:46:55,204 --> 01:46:56,873
I'll bet.

1406
01:46:58,437 --> 01:47:00,210
Things okay with you?

1407
01:47:00,314 --> 01:47:05,110
And then in January, David and I went
to Prague. That was a high point.

1408
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:08,343
- That sounds great.
- There's amazing puppet theater there.

1409
01:47:08,447 --> 01:47:10,324
Yeah, I've heard. I've gotta see that.

1410
01:47:10,428 --> 01:47:16,789
And there's this church decorated
with, like, human skulls and bones.

1411
01:47:16,685 --> 01:47:20,438
Forty thousand skulls and bones.

1412
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:23,567
I thought about you when I went there.

1413
01:47:45,881 --> 01:47:49,426
Charlie, I'm with someone.
Why are you doing this now?

1414
01:47:52,972 --> 01:47:55,057
I love you.

1415
01:48:01,313 --> 01:48:05,380
I should go. I have to....

1416
01:48:05,276 --> 01:48:09,447
Stuff I have to do.
I'm going away this weekend....

1417
01:48:09,447 --> 01:48:13,409
- Million things, okay?
- Yeah.

1418
01:48:27,382 --> 01:48:29,989
I love you too, you know.

1419
01:48:50,009 --> 01:48:53,658
I have to go right home.
I know how to finish the script now.

1420
01:48:53,554 --> 01:48:56,578
It ends with Kaufman driving home
after his lunch with Amelia...

1421
01:48:56,682 --> 01:48:59,393
...thinking he knows
how to finish the script.

1422
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:02,522
Shit, that's voice-over.
McKee would not approve.

1423
01:49:02,626 --> 01:49:05,858
How else can I show his thoughts?
I don't know.

1424
01:49:05,754 --> 01:49:09,091
Well, who cares what McKee says?
It feels right.

1425
01:49:09,195 --> 01:49:11,176
Conclusive.

1426
01:49:11,281 --> 01:49:15,034
I wonder who's gonna play me.
Someone not too fat.

1427
01:49:15,034 --> 01:49:18,580
I like that Gerard Depardieu,
but can he not do the accent?

1428
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:23,063
Anyway, it's done.
And that's something.

1429
01:49:23,063 --> 01:49:27,964
So: "Kaufman drives off from
his encounter with Amelia...

1430
01:49:27,964 --> 01:49:31,301
...filled for the first time with hope."

1431
01:49:32,135 --> 01:49:34,221
I like this.

1432
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:36,827
This is good.
