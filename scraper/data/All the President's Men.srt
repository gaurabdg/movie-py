00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,821
Holy shit.

158
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,824
BOB: Eugenio Martinez,
known as Gene Valdez.

159
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,160
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

160
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:28,039
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.
All five of the men had at least one alias.

161
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,917
Any proof they were trying
to bug the Democratic chairman?

162
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,627
CARL:
It's obvious they were trying to.

163
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,171
They wouldn't go to that trouble
to bug secretaries.

164
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,840
- There's no proof.
- I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

165
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,801
He said four of the guys that were arrested
were from Miami.

166
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,595
Gonzalez, Martinez, Sturgis and, uh...

167
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,804
- Barker.
- Yeah, Barker.

168
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,641
And all four of them were involved
in CIA activities and...

169
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,267
BOB: No, only one.
CARL: Yeah, and they...

170
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,729
No, only one of them was admitted CIA,
and the CIA won't confirm that.

171
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,856
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

172
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,692
But it's obvious
that with all that money and equipment...

173
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,946
...they weren't out to, you know,
work by themselves.

174
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,155
Somebody hired them.

175
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,699
I'm interested in what you know.

176
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,661
We don't know why they wanted
to bug Democratic headquarters.

177
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,331
Whether they were working for themselves,
other individuals, organizations.

178
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,249
Could be a story or just crazy Cubans.

179
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,418
Bachinski, when you get there,
take it easy.

180
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,253
The police are nervous.

[PHONE RINGING]

182
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,723
- Yeah? BACHINSKI: Calling
from police headquarters.

183
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,352
A friend just showed me what they found
in the hotel rooms of the burglars.

184
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,521
There's something
you might wanna look into.

185
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,064
Hang on.

186
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,232
Okay, go ahead.

187
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,276
There's a strange entry
in two of the burglars' address books.

188
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,197
- Yeah?
- One says "H.H. at W.H."

189
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,992
The other says
"Howard Hunt, W. House."

190
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,998
BOB: You can dial the White House direct,
can't you?

191
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,833
WOMAN 1: Yeah.
- What's the number?

192
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,920
WOMAN 1:

193
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,766
WOMAN 2: White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.

194
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,019
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.

195
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,772
He might be in Mr. Colson's office.
I'll connect you.

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,607
Thank you.

00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,612
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.

199
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,907
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- No, I don't.

200
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,117
Okay, thank you.

201
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,661
- Have you tried the Mullen firm?
- I beg your pardon?

202
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,831
He also works as a writer
at Mullen and Company Public Relations.

203
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,752
- You have a phone on that or an address?
- No, I don't. I'm sorry.

I'm glad you asked me that question.

211
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,938
The reason I'm glad is because
if you had asked Simons or Bradlee...

212
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,148
...they would've said:

213
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:03,319
"You know, we're gonna have to fire this
schmuck at once because he's so dumb."

Who is Charles Colson?

215
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,533
The most powerful man
in the United States is President Nixon.

216

You've heard of him?

Charles Colson is special counsel
to the president.

218
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,125
There's a cartoon on his wall.

219
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,088
Caption reads,
"When you've got them by the balls...

Yes. Yes, what is it?

00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,779
I was just wondering
why your name and phone number...

230
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,658
...were in the address books
of two of the men arrested at Watergate.

- The matter is under adjudication.

No, I don't believe so...

...and I can't imagine
why anyone would say that.

Yeah. Yeah, he's one of our authors.
He wrote spy novels, I think.

What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern or period...?

You say "wrote"?
You mean he's no longer with you?

No, not at this time.

And the CIA.

Well, if you're conducting
that kind of an investigation...

that Howard was with the CIA.

No, no surprise at all.

Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

279
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,509
From '49 to '70.
This is on deep background...

280

...but the FBI thinks he's involved
with the break-in.

What else you got?

282
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:21,100
According to White House personnel,
Hunt worked as a consultant for Colson.

283
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,770
That's Charles Colson,
the president's special counsel.

284
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,856
- Did you call the White House
Press Office? - I went over there.

285
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,484
They said Hunt hadn't worked there
for three months.

286
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,696
Then a PR guy
said this weird thing to me.

287
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,491
He said,
"I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson...

288
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,370
...nor anyone else at the White House
had any knowledge of or participation in...

00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,666
...this deplorable incident

Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?

Absolutely.

00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,046
So?

293
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,716
I never asked about Watergate.

294
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,386
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties
at the White House.

295
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,223
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

296
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,686
Be careful how you write it.

297
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,274
We got a White House consultant
linked to the bugging.

298
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,860
This isn't a police story anymore.
This is national.

299
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,405
- We need a top political writer on it.
- Well, they don't want it.

300
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,824
They're all over the map

- He's been on this paper for nine months.

00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,039
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper.

303
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,708
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

304
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,960
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few closed.

We'd like to speak to you.

1050
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,476
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Reelect.

1051
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:59,604
CARL: Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
BOB: Would you object to just...?

1052
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:01,064
MAN:
Forget it.

1053
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,107
- Yes? Hi.
CARL: Hi.

1054
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,650
BOB: Miss Milland? Betty Milland?
- Mm-hm.

1055
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,611
BOB: I'm Bob Woodward.
CARL: Carl Bernstein.

1056
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:08,237
We're from the Washington Post.

1057
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,990
I know you're trying to do your job.
I mean...

1058
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,826
You don't understand
the pressure we're under.

1059
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,996
- If we could come in for a couple
seconds... - No, I really don't...

1060
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,206
We don't wanna come in.

1061
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:22,376
We understand there was some documents
that were shredded at the committee.

1062
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,128
Well, there, uh...

1063
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,589
There's often shredding.
I mean, we do that a lot.

1064
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:28,466
Were you there during the shredding?

1065
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:29,884
- Yes, I was.
- I see.

1066
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:33,554
Were there any department heads
from the committee who were also present?

1067
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,599
Uh, yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

1068
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,809
BOB: John Mitchell?
- Yes.

1069
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,185
- The attorney general?
- Uh-huh.

1070
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:42,021
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.

1071
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,023
You know, because he was...
I thought he was gonna go:

1072
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,483
Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo.

1073
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,111
- But, uh, I...
- Did he supervise the shredding?

1074
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,363
Uh, I just...
Can I not answer any more questions?

1075
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:53,449
I'd just as soon not...
Okay? Maybe I could call you.

1076
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,369
CARL: It's...
- Are you being told not to talk?

1077
01:05:57,121 --> 01:06:00,623
CARL: Will you call us?
- I don't know.

1078
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,958
I'll try.

1079
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,460
What about that shredding
right after the break-in?

1080
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,629
We need to know the papers
in the shredding.

1081
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:10,383
You have some idea what's in the papers
when the attorney general comes in...

1082
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:13,511
...it's at the committee,
and he's got a raincoat over his head.

1083
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,347
It could be raining.
Let me go through the story again.

1084
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,766
You got a woman who's frightened.
Works for CREEP.

1085
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:21,894
She said there's shredding.
We don't know what's in the papers.

1086
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:25,565
We know the former attorney general
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

1087
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,318
Could be raining. There's a lawyer present.
We don't know what he asked them.

1088
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,320
Will you tell me where there's a story?

1089
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,490
In the fact that the interview
did not take place in her home...

1090
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,409
...but in the office of the committee.

1091
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:40,246
- How is there a story in that?
- Because there's a lawyer in the office.

1092
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,707
- You're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.

1093
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,376
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.

1094
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:48,754
CARL: Well, then let's just turn around
and go back and question her again.

1095
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:53,593
- This won't take long at all. We just...
- Please go away, okay?

1096
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,512
Will you please leave
before they see you?

1097
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,640
- Who did you mean by...?
- What do you mean, "they"?

1098
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,392
Could you give us their names?

1099
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,563
CARL: We haven't revealed the sources
of the people that have talked to us.

1100
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:10,443
- I really can't talk about this because...
- Would they be members of the committee?

1101
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,114
CARL:
Someone got to that woman.

1102
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,908
It's the key to the whole cover-up.

1103
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,119
BOB: How can you write there's a cover-up?
We don't know that there is.

1104
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,582
Then I don't know what the hell you need.
So you tell me what you need.

1105
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,294
BOB: I need more fact for a story,
and I think you should need the same.

1106
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,963
CARL: if you get in a car and
there's music... - I'm in a car.

1107
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,424
There's music playing in the car...
Hypothetically.

1108
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:36,469
There's music playing for 10 minutes
and there's no commercial.

1109
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,054
What can you deduce from that?

1110
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,388
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on.

1111
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,640
Is it AM or FM?

1112
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:44,852
A guy can come up to me on the street,
and he can ask me an address.

1113
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,813
Now, is the man interrogating me,
or is he lost?

1114
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,482
What kind of a story do I write?

1115
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,692
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

1116
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,862
CARL: You don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

1117
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,657
BOB: I don't have enough gut feeling.
I wish I did.

1118
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,160
BOB:
We're from the Washington Post.

1119
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,163
Ammons, Irene Ammons. Did we see her?

1120
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:09,502
Abbott, Addison, Augusto, Alberte.

1121
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:19,387
Is there something that strikes you
as odd about this?

1122
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:21,305
CARL: What?
BOB: It's like there's a pattern...

1123
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,600
...to the way they're not talking,
the way they say no all the time.

1124
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:25,977
I think it's odd.

1125
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,895
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.

1126
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:32,650
- Hi, we're from the Washington Post.
- I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward.

1127
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:35,695
BOB: A friend of the committee
said that we could contact you.

1128
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,905
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.

1129
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,366
You can talk to us.
We don't reveal our sources.

1130
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,576
You people.

1131
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,831
You think you can come into my home,
ask a few questions...

1132
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:52,336
...have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

1133
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,381
Do you understand loyalty?

1134
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:58,050
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

1135
01:08:58,677 --> 01:09:00,303
BOB & CARL: Hi.
- Yes?

1136
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,054
BOB: I'm Bob Woodward.
CARL: Carl Bernstein.

1137
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,640
- We're from the Washington Post.
- Yes.

1138
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:08,102
I've read what you've written.
I wanna thank you.

1139
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,897
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

1140
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,525
Would you mind
if we asked you a few questions?

1141
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,861
No, no. Come in. Would you like coffee?

1142
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,613
Sure.

1143
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,533
What they've done
is a threat to the Constitution.

1144
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,827
It goes against everything we stand for.

1145
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,830
Could you be a little bit more specific
than that?

1146
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:30,791
I'm afraid your articles
have just scratched the surface.

1147
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,586
You don't mind
if I just take a few notes, do you?

1148
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:35,212
No.

1149
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,466
How long have you worked
at the committee?

1150
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:39,675
Committee?

1151
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:43,554
Yes, the Committee
to Reelect the President.

1152
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:48,100
Oh. Oh, no, I don't work
at the Committee to Reelect the President.

1153
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:52,897
I work at Garfinckel's,
in the Accounting Department.

1154
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,778
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.

1155
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,113
Judith Abbott?

1156
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,618
Carolyn Abbott.

1157
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,039
We're just doing something wrong.

1158
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,336
- It's never been there.
- No.

1159
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,838
We're doing something wrong.

1160
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:20,549
It's just not good enough.

1161
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,303
How can you keep going at something
past the point when you'd believe it?

1162
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,472
Just have to start all over again.

1163
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:35,106
CARL:
Nasemith, Narrow, Ness...

1164
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,441
...Nickels, Nixon...

1165
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,485
BOB:
Ed Nixon.

1166
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:42,571
Jolson, Jones...

1167
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,740
...Jordan, Jost.

1168
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:48,160
If we could only get somebody
that worked for Finance to talk.

1169
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,079
- What about the bookkeeper?
CARL: Which?

1170
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,373
BOB: The bookkeeper that worked
for both Slans and...

1171
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:54,375
CARL: Oh, you're all right.
BOB: Sloan and Stans.

1172
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:57,336
CARL: I've been there. I've called her
twice. There's no answer.

1173
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,713
BOB:
I say we should start again.

1174
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:04,343
Abbott, Addison, Augusto, Alberte...

1175
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:07,263
...Aldus, Alessandro...

1176
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,850
CARL:
Eulosky, Clan, Constell...

1177
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:15,146
BOB:
Boyle, Brenner, Bromley, Jost...

1178
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:19,442
CARL:
Nasemith, Narrow, Ness, Nickels...

1179
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,528
BOB:
Teeny, Sandstrom...

1180
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,991
Skroes, Skully...

1181
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:29,660
CARL:
Skully. We've been there twice.

1182
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,498
All right, Wilcox, Winthrow,
Windsor, Worts...

1183
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,043
Two weeks work, half the names
crossed off and what have you got?

1184
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,795
BOB:
People aren't talking, Harry.

1185
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,631
And it's the way they're not talking
that's unnatural.

1186
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:46,051
We've been up all night. We went
over all the quotes of the people...

1187
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,554
BOB: It's like they're getting
instructions. It's pat.

1188
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:51,015
You wanna hear some real news?

1189
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:53,434
That GAO report
in which you placed so much faith?

1190
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:56,103
It's been postponed
till after tonight's renomination.

1191
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:58,731
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans.

1192
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,567
Says he has new information,
not to republish without it.

1193
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:04,403
They're gonna bury the report
till after the renomination.

1194
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:06,071
The indictment will be out soon.

- Yeah.

Here. L, P and M.

- What do you mean?
- L, P and M.

1347
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:27,192
- She'd only give me initials.
- Initials?

1348
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,695
Yeah, the initials of the men
that worked under Mitchell: L, P and M.

I'm trying to get anything I can.

1352
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,746
She said L, P and M...
That's all she'd give me.

1353
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:41,873
...are the people
who worked under Mitchell.

1354
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,584
She said something about Mitchell.
She hates him.

1355
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,294
- She said that?
- Here. She said:

1356
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,381
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful."

What are you writing about Sloan?

1358
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,635
- "Sloan was the treasurer."
- His wife did what?

1359
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:57,556
"His wife is pregnant and made Sloan quit.
He no longer wanted to be part of it."

1360
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:58,890
We've gotta go see Sloan.

1361
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,767
- Okay, make a note of it.
- All right.

01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:03,270
So, what have we got?
Where's that matchbook? Here.

01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,522
- L, P and M.
- Okay, L, P and M.

1364
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:08,400
- L could be LaRue. It could be Liddy.
- L is Liddy.

1365
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,569
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.

1366
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,155
Right here, she said,
"At the time of the break-in...

01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,199
...there was so much money
that I know Gordon got part of it."

1368
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:19,161
I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said yes. So L is Liddy.

01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,912
- Right.
- Okay, that leaves P and M.

There was a guy we talked to last week.

Didn't he say there was a Bart Porter
who was a member of the committee?

1374

- Porter was called before the grand jury.
- So P is definitely Porter.

P could be Porter.

All that leaves is M.

It could be Mardian.

1379
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,691
It could be...

1380

- ...Magruder.
- I think it's Magruder.

- I think it's Magruder too.
- Why do you think it is?

1382
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:56,948
He was second in command under Mitchell.
Why do you?

1383
01:23:57,116 --> 01:24:01,077
Because at one time, he was the temporary
head of the committee, before Mitchell.

1384
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:05,081
I don't want a cookie. We've gotta get
that bookkeeper to say it was Magruder.

1385
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:09,085

- We gotta go back and get her to say it.

who paid off the burglars.

...and you ask her who P is.

1398
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,084
- Yeah.
- And then I say:

1399

"No, no, no, we know P is Porter."
I just bury it.

been reported now...

KLEINDIENST: I think the investigation...

1434
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:03,635
...that has just concluded itself has
probably been one of the most intensive...

...that the Department of Justice
and the FBI has ever been involved in.

And that, I think...

1463
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:40,315
You know, the reason we're here, basically,
is that we talked to certain people...

01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:42,442
...who indicated you left the committee...

1465
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:44,903
...because you no longer wanted
to be part of it.

1466
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,946
Maybe there's a legitimate explanation...

1467
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:50,408
...for why the money was handed
to Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

1468
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,747
Try and understand this.

1469
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:59,542
- I'm a Republican.
- I am too.

1470
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,377
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

What happened on June 17th...

1473
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,260
...I don't think the president
knew anything about.

1474
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,763
CARL: Is it possible some of his people
might have known?

1475
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:12,972
I'm not sure.

1476
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,849
CARL:
Think the truth will come out at the trial?

1477
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:17,143
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?

1478
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,854
Obviously because certain people
lie to the prosecutor.

1479
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,106
No, we were never told flat-out,
"Don't talk."

1480
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,108
But the message was clear, though.

1481
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:27,028
In other words, by their very silence,
there was a cover-up.

1482
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:29,781
They didn't urge us to come forward
and tell the truth.

1483
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:32,116
"They" meaning the White House?

1484
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,327
The committee's not
an independent operation.

1485
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:36,412
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

1486
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,707
And I don't think that the FBI
or the prosecutors understand that.

No, it was closer to 1 million.

you could release those funds?

they're obvious.

Well, there had to be
a White House overseer.

- Yeah, Colson.
- What?

1498
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:13,741
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

The other one's not in Washington,

who know details of the bugging...

1637
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:00,416
...the FBI hasn't even talked to.

1638
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:04,128
Why have you conducted interviews of
CREEP personnel at CREEP headquarters...

1639
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:07,381
...instead of at their homes,
where they might feel freer to talk?

1640
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:08,632
Joe, wait a minute.

1641
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,469
Why have the interviews at CREEP
always been conducted...

1642
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:14,305
...within the presence of the lawyer
who works for CREEP?

1643
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:17,141
Look, you know,
I can't answer for the whole bureau.

1644
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:20,478
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.

1645
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:24,065
I followed my orders, period.

1646
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:31,822
What orders?

1647
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:38,662
CARL:
Woodward! Woodward!

1648
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,624
Wait!

1649
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,043
Bob!

1650
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:49,715
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

1651
01:38:51,093 --> 01:38:54,303
This morning I get a tip to call a
guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

1652
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:57,139
...who is now the assistant
attorney general of Tennessee.

1653
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,558
Now, the guy told me that called me...
That said...

1654
01:38:59,726 --> 01:39:02,269
He said that Shipley was asked
in the summer of 1971...

1655
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,814
...by an old Army buddy,
a Donald Segretti...

1656
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,774
...to join a group of other lawyers...

1657
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:09,819
...for Nixon's campaign
to sabotage the Democratic candidates.

1658
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:13,114
- Make a left. We'll go to my place.
- Sabotage Democratic candidates?

1659
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:15,220
CARL: I was able to make
a couple calls, and

1660
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:17,159
I got Segretti's records
for the year...

1661
01:39:17,327 --> 01:39:20,746
His travel records for the year 1971-'72.

1662
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:21,956
Does the FBI know...?

1663
01:39:22,124 --> 01:39:24,125
- Did you say left or right?
- Left, my place.

1664
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,419
- We gotta go through the records.
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?

1665
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:30,714
FBI interrogated Segretti,
found he wasn't involved in the break-in.

1666
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:32,716
They dropped it, didn't follow through.

1667
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:34,426
BOB: Where is he?
CARL: He's in California.

1668
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:36,554
BOB: Jesus, look at this.
CARL: What?

1669
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:39,390
BOB: Segretti crisscrossed the country
at least a dozen times.

1670
01:39:42,227 --> 01:39:45,020
Only stayed in cities
where there were Democratic primaries.

1671
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,064
CARL:
If the break-in was just one incident...

1672
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:49,859
...in a campaign of sabotage
that began a year before...

1673
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:52,069
BOB: For the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

1674
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:53,279
CARL:
This isn't so crazy.

1675
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:55,573
This whole thing didn't start
with the bugging.

1676
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:58,033
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

1677
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:00,744
And a year before,
Nixon was running behind Muskie...

1678
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,205
...before Muskie self-destructed.

1679
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:05,916
If he self-destructed.

1680
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:09,461
CARL: Hi. Uh, Donald Segretti?
- That's right.

1681
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,923
I'm Carl Bernstein
from the Washington Post.

1682
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:14,675
Hi.

1683
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:16,677
What can I do for you?

1684
01:40:16,845 --> 01:40:21,599
Well, my paper just sent me out here
to try to persuade you to go on the record.

1685
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:22,766
Why me?

1686
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,810
Because you were the head coordinator...

1687
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:28,856
...of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

1688
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:33,277
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.

1689
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:41,619
Carl, tell me something. What...?

1690
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:44,121
What do you imagine
the head coordinator does?

1691
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:48,083
I guess basically you were involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

1692
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,293
...other lawyers.

1693
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:52,838
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.

1694
01:40:53,006 --> 01:40:57,259
I made it clear that I would not
do anything violent or illegal.

1695
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,803
What do you mean by illegal?

1696
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:03,432
Watergate. I mean, that's...
The whole bugging, that's horrendous.

1697
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:06,310
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do, then?

1698
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,687
Nickel-and-dime stuff.

1699
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:10,648
Stuff.

1700
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:12,733
Stuff with a little wit attached to it.

1701
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:15,319
You mean when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery...

1702
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:18,489
...that Senator Hubert Humphrey
was going out with call girls?

1703
01:41:18,949 --> 01:41:21,784
Listen, if anything,
it helped the man's image.

1704
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:24,495
What was the one
on Muskie's stationery you sent out...

1705
01:41:24,955 --> 01:41:28,707
...that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

1706
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,835
So sometimes it got up to a quarter,
off the record.

1707
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,966
I think one of the most interesting ones
was the "Canuck" letter.

1708
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:38,842
What about it?

1709
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:43,347
Come on. Where you claimed
that Muskie slurred the Canadians.

1710
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:45,849
No, I didn't write that.

1711
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,017
Do you know who did?

1712
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:50,312
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers,
then I'll know.

1713
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,982
Smart guy, Donald.

1714
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:54,191
You're no dummy.

1715
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,695
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

1716
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:59,154
I'm a lawyer.

1717
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:00,864
I'm a good lawyer...

1718
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:04,702
...and I'll probably wind up going to jail
and being disbarred.

1719
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:10,666
And I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

1720
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:18,507
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

1721
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:22,636
- I didn't go looking for the job.
- Well, that's important.

1722
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:25,681
Chapin came to you.

1723
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:33,147
You know what?

1724
01:42:33,315 --> 01:42:37,401
It's funny, but I keep forgetting
that you guys knew each other in college.

1725
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:41,488
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin.
Who else was there?

1726
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,741
There was me...

1727
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,534
...Dwight...

1728
01:42:45,702 --> 01:42:46,952
...Ziegler.

1729
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,579
The whole USC mafia.

1730
01:42:48,747 --> 01:42:51,540
And that's when you got involved
in the student elections...

1731
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:55,753
...and started to try to get your man in,
so you stuffed ballot boxes and...

1732
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,881
What was that term you guys used
for screwing up the opposition?

1733
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:02,301
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.

1734
01:43:02,469 --> 01:43:03,927
You were doing the same stuff...

1735
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,764
...when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

1736
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:09,850
Let me tell you something,
we did a lot of worse things in college.

1737
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:11,101
[CHUCKLES]

1738
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:14,396
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

1739
01:43:14,564 --> 01:43:17,316
What would you have done
if you were just out of the Army...

1740
01:43:17,484 --> 01:43:19,151
...been away for four years...

1741
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:22,613
...didn't know what kind of law
you wanted to practice...

1742
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:25,282
...and one day you get a call
from an old friend...

1743
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,994
...asking if you wanna go to work
for the president of the United States?

1744
01:43:29,162 --> 01:43:33,582
Jeez. Chapin was the appointment secretary
for Nixon when he called.

1745
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,792
Yeah.

1746
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,629
If those sinister things really happened,
I don't think Dwight knew about them.

1747
01:43:38,797 --> 01:43:42,299
- He just did what he was told.
- Told by who?

1748
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:55,145
DEEP THROAT:
What's the topic for tonight?

1749
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:02,152
Rat-fucking.

1750
01:44:04,114 --> 01:44:07,908
In my day, it was simply known
as a double-cross.

1751
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:10,953
In our present context...

1752
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:15,582
...it means infiltration of the Democrats.

1753
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:19,044
Segretti won't go on the record...

1754
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:21,713
...but if he would,
we know he would implicate Chapin.

1755
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:26,677
And that would put you
inside the White House.

1756
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,430
Who?

1757
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,308
Can you be specific?

1758
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:35,352
How high up?

1759
01:44:38,523 --> 01:44:41,567
You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1760
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:45,612
I don't like newspapers.

1761
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:52,035
I don't care for inexactitude
and shallowness.

1762
01:44:53,705 --> 01:44:55,456
The CREEP slush fund...

1763
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:59,001
...that financed the rat-fucking,
we've just about got that nailed down.

1764
01:44:59,169 --> 01:45:00,544
Did you change cabs?

1765
01:45:08,303 --> 01:45:09,803
BOB:
Yeah.

1766
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:13,098
Does the FBI know what we know?

1767
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,395
Does Justice?

1768
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,735
Why haven't they done anything?

1769
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:30,240
If it didn't deal directly with
the break-in, they didn't pursue.

1770
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,451
Who told them not to?

1771
01:45:32,911 --> 01:45:35,913
Don't you understand what you're on to?

1772
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,127
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.

1773
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:45,881
Do you think something this size
just happens?

1774
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:47,925
Haldeman had to know too.

1775
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:51,220
You'll get nothing from me
about Haldeman.

1776
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:56,225
Segretti said that...

1777
01:45:56,392 --> 01:46:00,729
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

1778
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:05,526
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

1779
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:07,778
...did that come
from inside the White House?

1780
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:11,031
- You're missing the overall.
- But what overall?

1781
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,284
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

1782
01:46:14,744 --> 01:46:18,455
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

1783
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:21,875
They bugged, they followed people.

1784
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:24,711
False press leaks, fake letters.

1785
01:46:25,255 --> 01:46:27,464
They canceled
Democratic campaign rallies.

1786
01:46:27,632 --> 01:46:30,592
They investigated
Democratic private lives.

1787

01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:14,092
I would have no problems
if you wrote a story like that.

1935
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:16,886
- You wouldn't?
- No.

1936
01:56:17,638 --> 01:56:20,223
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

1937
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:22,642
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yeah. My wife did.

1938
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,561
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- It's a girl.

1939
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:26,020
- Congratulations.
- Oh, great.

1940
01:56:26,188 --> 01:56:27,230
Thank you.

1941
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:28,982

- Yeah.

- I will.

1943
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:36,656
Well, I think that Woodward's just...

1944
01:56:36,824 --> 01:56:40,201
And I am curious of the fact
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry...

1945
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:42,392
...never talked to or
did inquiries into the

1946
01:56:42,393 --> 01:56:44,414
second most powerful
man to the president.

You don't seem to understand.

No, you get nothing
about Haldeman out of me.

1949
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:51,087
CARL: But we don't need
to know anything, Joe.

1950
01:56:51,255 --> 01:56:53,339
Tomorrow we're going with a story
on the FBI.

1951
01:56:53,507 --> 01:56:56,426
- What does that mean?
- We're going to establish in that story...

1952
01:56:56,594 --> 01:56:59,262
...that you guys just about
blew the whole investigation.

1953
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:00,889
Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.

1954
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:03,308
You didn't know Haldeman
had control of the fund.

1955
01:57:03,475 --> 01:57:04,684
It's all in our files.

1956
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:07,270
- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.

1957
01:57:07,438 --> 01:57:10,690
Look. Now, look, I'm very busy. I gotta go.
I gotta go put the kids to bed.

That's the confirmation right there.

01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:19,282
Wait a minute, wait a second.
Did he say John?

1961
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,492
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.

1962
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:24,287
What difference does it make
if he said Isaiah or David?

1963
01:57:24,455 --> 01:57:25,705
There's only one Haldeman.

1964
01:57:25,873 --> 01:57:29,125
BOB: Well, Isaiah or David aren't assistant
to the president.

1965
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,085
I don't know, it still feels thin.

1966

- Christ, I wish I knew if we could
print this. HARRY: Wait a minute.

1967
01:57:34,298 --> 01:57:37,550
We didn't make them do these things.
Once they did, they're fair game.

1968
01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:39,427
HOWARD:
Let's go over your sources again.

1969
01:57:39,595 --> 01:57:42,805
BOB: Sloan told the grand jury.
He answered everything they asked him.

1970
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:45,099
That means there's gotta be
a record somewhere.

1971
01:57:45,267 --> 01:57:48,228
CARL: He told the grand jury,
the FBI confirms. What more do you need?

1972
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:49,812
I happen to love this country.

1973
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,566
- We're not zanies out to bring it down.
HOWARD: Weren't you arguing the opposite?

1974
01:57:53,734 --> 01:57:55,526
HARRY: No, no, not at all.
- I can't believe it.

1975
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:56,778
Now, hold it. Hold it.

HARRY:
One has nothing to do with the other.

1977
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:00,365
We're about to accuse Haldeman...

1978
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:02,867
...the second most important man
in this country...

1979
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:05,745
...of conducting a conspiracy
from inside the White House.

It would be nice if we were right.

- Jesus.

- Absolutely.

1983

BEN: Woodward?
- I'm sure.

1984
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:17,715
I'm not. Still seems thin.

1985

Get another source.

CARL: How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

1987
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:29,227
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
BOB: He won't confirm, I told you.

1988
01:58:29,395 --> 01:58:31,271
- The guy in Justice?
- Can't call him.

1989
01:58:31,438 --> 01:58:33,690
- He's next to the grand jury.

Twenty minutes to deadline.

Hi, this is Carl.
I'm sorry to disturb you now.

We're going with the story that Haldeman
was the fifth in control of the fund.

I won't say anything about Haldeman.

2001

I understand. We know it's against the law
for you to say anything.

If you could warn us to hold on the story,

...after the Watergate break-in...

2033
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:33,619
...showed up for a deposition in the suit
on disclosure of campaign contributions...

2034
02:01:33,787 --> 02:01:35,538
...and denied naming Haldeman.

2035
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:38,416
REPORTER 1: Would you comment
on your testimony before the grand jury?

2036
02:01:38,584 --> 02:01:42,253
- I'd like my attorney to answer that.
- The answer is an unequivocal no.

2037
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:45,548
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman
in that testimony at all.

No, not at all.

None whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen.

to include his statements to the FBI...

...and to all federal authorities.

2044
02:01:59,313 --> 02:02:00,646
Later, at the White House...

2045
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:03,608

ZIEGLER:
Why is the Post trying to do it?

2048

You have a man...

2049
02:02:09,573 --> 02:02:12,909
...who's the editor of the Washington Post
by the name of Ben Bradlee.

2050
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:18,456
I think anyone who were to honestly assess
what his political persuasions are...

2051
02:02:18,624 --> 02:02:22,418
...would, I think,
come to the conclusion quite quickly...

2052
02:02:22,586 --> 02:02:25,129
...that he is not a supporter
of President Nixon.

2053

I respect the free press.

I don't respect the type of journalism...

The shabby journalism
that is being practiced...

2056

...by the Washington Post.

2057
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:39,560
All I know is that the story
that ran this morning is incorrect...

2058
02:02:39,728 --> 02:02:44,440
...and has been so stated
as being incorrect...

2059
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,528
...by not only me, but by the individual
whose grand-jury...

2060
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:52,281
Secret grand-jury testimony
they based their story on.

2061
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:56,494
And that individual has denied
that he ever so testified.

No sooner had Ziegler finished...

2063
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:02,124

Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.

...and huge scare headlines...

2067
02:03:11,426 --> 02:03:14,387
...the Post has maliciously sought
to give the appearance...

...of a direct connection between
the White House and the Watergate...

2069
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:19,767
...a charge which the Post knows...

2070
02:03:19,935 --> 02:03:23,813
...and half a dozen investigations
have found, to be false.

2071
02:03:23,981 --> 02:03:27,692
The hallmark of the Post's campaign
is hypocrisy...

2072
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:32,321
...and its celebrated double standard
is today visible for all to see.

on Haldeman in the files?

2077
02:03:40,747 --> 02:03:43,874
We have it in the notes from
the conversation with you on the phone.

2078
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:46,502
We have to go talk to your boss
if you don't talk.

2079
