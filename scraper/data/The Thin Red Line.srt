1
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,051
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,141
Why does nature vie with itself?.

3
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,936
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,075
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:20,456
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,820
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:18,240
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,705
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,500
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,713
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

11
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:39,469
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting
about her going back to God.

12
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,768
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

13
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,798
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:04,846
What it'd be like to know that this breath now
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

15
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:12,312
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

16
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,108
With the same... calm.

17
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:23,782
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

18
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,534
Kids around here never fight.

19
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:10,078
Sometimes.

20
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,165
Sometimes when you see them playing

21
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:15,417
they always fight!

22
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:21,882
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

23
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:26,636
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

24
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,848
- Why?
- Cos you look...

25
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,268
You look as an army!

26
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,437
- I look army?
- Yes.

27
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,274
Well, that don't matter.

28
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,070
It doesn't matter.

29
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,617
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

30
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:52,662
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

31
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,569
All right, come on. Turn around.

32
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,738
Go, go, go, go. Go!

33
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,658
Come on, go.

34
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,664
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:15,180
Witt, patrol boat!

36
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,349
She's American.

37
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:30,320
What's it doing out here all alone?

38
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,141
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

39
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,519
You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:08,858
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll put your head in the noose for him.

41
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,325
How many times you been AWOL?

42
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,039
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

43
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:27,127
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,296
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,464
We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:35,552
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

47
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,721
Look at you.

48
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,688
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:51,651
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in God's world.

50
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:58,033
This is C Company,
of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

51
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:02,954
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

52
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,875
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:12,255
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

54
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:14,841
But I worked a deal for ya.

55
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:17,010
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

56
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,307
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

57
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,811
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

58
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:31,107
I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,526
I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,082
In this world...

61
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,836
a man himself is nothing.

62
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,552
And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,349
You're wrong there, Top.

64
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:09,229
I seen another world.

65
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:18,696
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

66
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,201
Well,

67
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,995
then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:41,177
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:47,100
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:49,269
Look out for himself.

71
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:04,242
I might be the best friend you ever had.

72
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,538
You don't even know it.

73
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,405
He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:50,663
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

75
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:33,706
I love Charlie Company.

76
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,755
They're my people.

77
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,532
They call it "The Rock".

78
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:10,869
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,829
Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:18,501
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:23,798
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,386
The Marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

83
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:31,931
Worked my ass off.

84
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,560
Brown-nosed the generals.

85
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,898
Degraded myself

86
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,944
for them and my family.

87
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,323
For my home.

88
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,285
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

89
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:55,330
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

90
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,498
It's OK.

91
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:02,211
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

92
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:05,673
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,135
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,304
He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,473
Goes along to get along.

96
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,186
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:22,315
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,318
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

99
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,363
Like a hawk.

100
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:31,616
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

101
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,047
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,551
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:54,180
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:57,308
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

105
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,268
Yes, sir.

106
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:05,525
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,696
I guess we don't know the bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

108
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,866
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,618
You're a humble man.

110
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:20,957
Nobody wants that island... but you.

111
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,544
How much do you want it?

112
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,046
As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,969
All they sacrificed for me

114
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,766
poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,483
All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:04,083
Too late.

117
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,007
Died...

118
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,510
slow as a tree.

119
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:18,848
D'you feel it?

120
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,642
Yes, sir.

121
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,857
Thank you, sir.

122
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,498
Take topside to the signal bridge.

123
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,840
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

124
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,152
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

125
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,863
I can't help it. I got...

126
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:19,325
My stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

127
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:22,203
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

128
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:25,957
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

129
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,211
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

130
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:35,341
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

131
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:39,887
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

132
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:43,432
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

133
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:47,520
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

134
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:51,816
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

135
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:56,070
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

136
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,238
Train?

137
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:02,743
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

138
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:08,749
That's all you gotta worry about. This war
ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

139
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,169
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

140
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:17,008
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

141
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:20,678
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

142
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,638
What d'you want me to tell you?

143
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:25,766
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

144
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,310
Tell you something.

145
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:31,981
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

146
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:34,025
I already know that.

147
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,860
Well, brood on it, Tills.

148
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:38,237
Brood on it.

149
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:41,741
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

150
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:46,287
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

151
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,165
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

152
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:50,917
Yeah? Well, have fun.

153
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,210
Yeah, have fun.

154
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:58,132
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

155
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,844
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

156
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:03,804
Open the door!

157
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:08,476
You all learn to deal these cards...

158
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:13,189
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

159
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:17,526
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

160
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,364
All right, jack's high, jack to bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

161
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,413
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

162
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:34,293
How was I supposed to know there was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

163
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,258
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

164
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:44,095
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

165
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,138
It's that captain of ours.

166
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:51,018
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

167
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:56,565
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

168
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,331
Hello, Captain.

169
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,046
I read in your 201 file
that you were an officer before the war.

170
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:02,798
How'd you end up a private?

171
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,967
Cos of my wife.

172
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:07,928
I was in the corps of engineers.

173
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,183
We'd never been separated before,

174
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,352
not even for a night.

175
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:19,190
I took it for four months and then I quit.

176
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,194
Just resigned.

177
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:26,906
They sent me back to the States.

178
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:30,076
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

179
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,831
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

180
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,542
Sons of bitches.

181
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,253
No, I don't blame them.

182
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:45,758
Well, where is she now?

183
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,719
She's home.

184
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,527
Why should i be afraid to die?

185
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,614
I belong to you.

186
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:13,702
Move! Move! Move!

187
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:15,871
Move! Move!

188
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,255
Move! Move!

189
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,589
Moving out!

190
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:29,844
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

191
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,597
On the otherside of the dark waters.

192
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,982
Put your helmet on.

193
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,193
Be with me now.

194
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,747
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,418
I like you, Captain.

196
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:08,007
And I just want you to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

197
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,178
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

198
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,138
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

199
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,682
Gangway! Gangway there!

200
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:18,225
Coming through!

201
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,228
Squad leaders! Both teams!

202
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,647
This way, son. This way, right here.

203
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,775
Stand by to go over the side!

204
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,809
Our Father, who art in heaven...

205
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,689
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

206
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:50,401
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

207
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,165
Your outfit's lucky.

208
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,334
Transports must've been spotted.

209
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,337
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

210
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:23,225
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

211
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,049
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

212
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:57,217
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

213
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,845
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

214
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:01,305
- A week.
- A week, sir.

215
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:03,849
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

216
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:06,977
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

217
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,937
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

218
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,984
They got fish that live in trees.

219
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:22,159
If they didn't know this beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

220
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:57,171
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

221
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:31,663
Your death that captures all.

222
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:42,007
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

223
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,242
Your glory.

224
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:13,622
Mercy.

225
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,251
Peace.

226
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,296
Truth.

227
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:30,222
You give calm a spirit,

228
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,352
understanding,

229
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:39,231
courage.

230
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,988
The contented heart.

231
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:28,376
Get a medic here!

232
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:38,178
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

233
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:43,391
All faces of the same man.

234
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:46,728
One big self.

235
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:24,057
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

236
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,233
Each like a coal

237
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,402
drawn from the fire.

238
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,270
We're going straight up that hill there.

239
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:18,028
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

240
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:21,031
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

241
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:24,910
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

242
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,040
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

243
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:32,542
My men are... passing out, sir.

244
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:44,221
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

245
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:01,738
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

246
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:05,200
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

247
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:08,078
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.

248
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:24,928
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it,
so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

249
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,139
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

250
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:31,226
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

251
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,314
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

252
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:44,614
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

253
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,961
Are you here?

254
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:56,353
Let me not betray you.

255
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:02,150
Let me not betray my men.

256
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:12,118
In you I place my trust.

257
00:41:28,134 --> 00:41:30,220
Rosy-fingered dawn.

258
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,140
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

259
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:36,309
D'you ever read Homer?

260
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,937
We read Homer at the Point.

261
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,897
In Greek.

262
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,484
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

263
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:49,155
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

264
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:53,618
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

265
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:49,340
OK, you guys.

266
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,092
This is it.

267
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:53,678
We're going down in groups often.

268
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:59,559
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

269
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,978
run all the way.

270
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:05,398
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

271
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,820
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

272
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,239
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

273
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:16,034
You go organise them guys that's up there.

274
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:24,042
Moving out in five minutes.

275
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,544
Let's go.

276
00:43:30,757 --> 00:43:32,634
Sico?

277
00:43:33,426 --> 00:43:36,387
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick to my stomach.

278
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:39,807
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

279
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:41,684
I can't. I would if I could.

280
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:44,103
I'm sick.

281
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:46,064
I'm sick.

282
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:48,233
You ain't sick. Get up!

283
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,949
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

284
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:59,202
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

285
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,538
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

286
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,418
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

287
00:44:07,502 --> 00:44:11,756
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

288
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,925
Thank you, Sergeant.

289
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,304
Don't argue with me.

290
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,473
Good luck, Keck.

291
00:45:23,828 --> 00:45:25,913
Plug that hole on your right!

292
00:45:25,997 --> 00:45:27,874
Move!

293
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,646
Maybe they pulled out.

294
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:02,028
Hit dirt!

295
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:04,363
Hit dirt!

296
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:12,205
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

297
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:19,045
Stretcher-bearers!

298
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,395
Come on!

299
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,564
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

300
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:42,860
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

301
00:48:42,944 --> 00:48:46,989
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

302
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:50,368
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

303
00:48:50,451 --> 00:48:54,539
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

304
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,626
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

305
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:03,047
Hello, First Sergeant.

306
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:07,218
Who we going after over here?

307
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,096
We think it's Jacques.

308
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:12,306
Ol' Jockey.

309
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,101
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

310
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:17,061
Sir?

311
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:23,025
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

312
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,947
- OK, but you gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

313
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:33,411
Nicky! You're still alive!

314
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:36,205
Keep moving! Keep moving!

315
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:43,296
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest
thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

316
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:47,884
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

317
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,511
Young Whyte led beautifully.

318
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:52,680
Yes, sir. Over.

319
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:55,641
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

320
00:49:55,725 --> 00:50:01,230
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think
they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

321
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:04,108
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

322
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,277
Did they knock any out?

323
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,406
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

324
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,827
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

325
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,163
Here, sir. Over.

326
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:22,126
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

327
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:24,587
Children.

328
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,506
I don't know, sir.

329
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:32,094
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

330
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:36,515
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

331
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,934
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

332
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:42,229
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.

333
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:45,524
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.

334
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:47,860
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

335
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,280
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

336
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:53,824
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

337
00:51:20,184 --> 00:51:22,269
Move up!

338
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:42,081
Hey, Keck!

339
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,167
Yeah!

340
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:48,421
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

341
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,298
Blane's dead.

342
00:51:51,382 --> 00:51:53,467
You're in charge.

343
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:59,557
We know you there, Yank!

344
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:02,435
Tojo eats shit!

345
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:05,771
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

346
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:43,434
I got him! I got him!

347
00:53:01,368 --> 00:53:03,454
I killed a man.

348
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,623
Hey, Queen!

349
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,209
Queen, you there?

350
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:12,338
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

351
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:15,382
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

352
00:53:15,466 --> 00:53:19,303
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

353
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:22,431
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!

354
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,976
I'm serious!

355
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,980
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

356
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,566
I got me one of 'em.

357
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:33,901
So?

358
00:53:33,984 --> 00:53:36,237
I think maybe they're pulling out.

359
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:41,951
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

360
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:43,577
You wanna be the one to do it?

361
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:52,044
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

362
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,610
Down!

363
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:27,371
Stay low.

364
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,025
Go! Go!

365
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:58,319
Go! Go!

366
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:41,237
What do we do now?

367
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,491
We wait right here. Maybe
they'll send us up some reinforcements.

368
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:47,034
To do what?

369
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:50,162
To capture some of these
fucking positions around here!

370
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:55,709
- You mean you really wanna go on with this?
- Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

371
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:59,463
If they send us reinforcements,
maybe we could scout around

372
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:01,632
and locate these machine guns.

373
00:56:01,715 --> 00:56:05,719
- Anyway, it's better than going back down.
- Something's coming!

374
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:07,721
They're coming!

375
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:14,478
What are they doin'?

376
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:17,648
If they want to throw us out,
why didn't they come in force?

377
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:19,942
Maybe they was acting on their own.

378
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,946
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

379
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,324
They're coming.

380
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:38,544
Keck!

381
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:40,045
Jesus!

382
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:42,214
Oh, Jesus!

383
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:45,467
I blew my butt off!

384
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:48,971
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

385
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:50,514
Lay down!

386
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:53,350
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

387
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:56,437
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I grabbed it by the pin!

388
00:56:57,146 --> 00:57:01,567
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

389
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,986
Nobody's gonna have to write her.
You'll make it.

390
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:05,946
- Don't bullshit me!
- Stay down!

391
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,115
Hey, hey.

392
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,993
Have I got mud on my face?

393
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:13,162
Wipe it off. Get it off.

394
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:16,749
No!

395
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,917
I'll write her. I promise.

396
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:26,342
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

397
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:33,223
It's for the best.

398
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,393
I'm all messed up down there.

399
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:39,646
I can't fuck no more.

400
00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:45,402
Whoa... Where am I?

401
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,530
Where am I?

402
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,660
You're gonna be all right.

403
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:57,873
Even if you die,
you didn't let your brother down.

404
00:57:57,956 --> 00:58:02,669
If you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

405
00:58:02,753 --> 00:58:04,838
I'm cold.

406
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:09,426
I'm cold.

407
00:58:10,677 --> 00:58:12,763
I'm... freezing.

408
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:10,237
You gonna write his wife?

409
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,532
Fuck, no.

410
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:16,034
I don't know his old lady.

411
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:21,165
That's the company commander's job. You
outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

412
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:23,333
You told him you would.

413
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:27,212
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

414
00:59:28,046 --> 00:59:29,923
Somebody ought to do it.

415
00:59:30,007 --> 00:59:32,885
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

416
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,438
What's wrong, Jim?

417
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:09,523
There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

418
01:01:09,606 --> 01:01:14,611
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

419
01:01:14,695 --> 01:01:17,948
- Would it keep him quiet?
- Not for long, but I can give him two.

420
01:01:18,031 --> 01:01:21,451
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

421
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:25,831
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

422
01:01:44,308 --> 01:01:46,393
That's what you are.

423
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:51,231
That's all there is for us.
That's us, that's us.

424
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:55,068
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

425
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,238
All twelve of 'em.

426
01:01:58,322 --> 01:01:59,781
It's insanity up there.

427
01:01:59,865 --> 01:02:03,952
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em
where to go and I gave 'em a push.

428
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:09,374
- Somebody help!
- I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

429
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:14,171
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here,
but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

430
01:02:14,254 --> 01:02:16,298
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

431
01:02:16,381 --> 01:02:20,510
I'm outta here. All right, move feet.
Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

432
01:02:20,594 --> 01:02:23,347
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

433
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:28,101
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

434
01:02:28,185 --> 01:02:30,187
All right. All right.

435
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,231
All right. All right.

436
01:02:51,249 --> 01:02:53,377
Somebody help me!

437
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,711
Help me!

438
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:59,591
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

439
01:02:59,674 --> 01:03:02,094
- OK. Calm down.
- Fuck you!

440
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:05,263
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

441
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:07,766
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

442
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:11,603
- How you gonna get me out?
- I'm gonna take you back.

443
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:16,692
- Come on.
- No!

444
01:03:16,775 --> 01:03:19,361
Put me down! Put me down!

445
01:03:24,741 --> 01:03:27,703
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

446
01:03:27,828 --> 01:03:30,163
Please, leave me alone.

447
01:03:38,588 --> 01:03:40,674
Give me more. Give me more.

448
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:43,552
Give me more. Give me more.

449
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:45,804
Give me more. Give me more.

450
01:03:48,932 --> 01:03:50,183
Here, Tella.

451
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:01,570
Goodbye... goodbye.

452
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:06,533
Bye, kid.

453
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:09,619
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

454
01:04:25,886 --> 01:04:29,848
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company
doesn't depend on one man.

455
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:37,814
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.

456
01:04:37,898 --> 01:04:42,152
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow
and recommend you for the Silver Star.

457
01:04:42,235 --> 01:04:44,863
- It's the most courageous thing...
- Captain,

458
01:04:44,946 --> 01:04:49,159
you say one more word to thank me,
I'll knock you right in the teeth.

459
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:52,954
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign so fast

460
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:57,083
and leave you here
to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

461
01:04:58,335 --> 01:05:00,420
You understand?

462
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:04,883
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

463
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:24,110
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those
men should be reinforced immediately!

464
01:05:24,194 --> 01:05:27,030
What are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses.

465
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:29,199
They're lying behind that ledge!

466
01:05:29,282 --> 01:05:32,828
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

467
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:35,831
I don't think you understand
what's going on, sir.

468
01:05:35,914 --> 01:05:38,792
We've had... heavy casualties.

469
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:43,755
We had a man... His gut got shot out
on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

470
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:47,008
Fine, fine. Now,
what about those reinforcements? Over.

471
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:50,637
I have... two squads to...

472
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,931
First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

473
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:55,433
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

474
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:58,979
Goddamn you, Staros!
When I say reinforcements,

475
01:05:59,062 --> 01:06:03,817
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit
everybody you have there and do it now!

476
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:07,904
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em
lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

477
01:06:07,988 --> 01:06:13,034
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to
attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

478
01:06:13,118 --> 01:06:15,912
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

479
01:06:15,996 --> 01:06:19,249
Have 'em press the centre.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

480
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:21,001
Attack them right now!

481
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:24,880
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you
a lesson on infantry tactics

482
01:06:24,963 --> 01:06:27,591
while your men
are getting their asses shot off?.

483
01:06:27,674 --> 01:06:31,428
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand
what is going on here.

484
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:34,723
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

485
01:06:34,806 --> 01:06:38,310
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much fire power.

486
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:40,478
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

487
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:43,940
We can't see it, and it's...
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

488
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,697
I request permission
for patrol reconnaissance around

489
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,409
to the right of Hill 210.
I believe the entire position, sir,

490
01:06:54,492 --> 01:06:57,120
can be outflanked
with a manoeuvre there in force.

491
01:06:57,203 --> 01:06:59,497
- No! Goddamn it, no!
- Might save lives!

492
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:01,458
There'll be no flanking move.

493
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,377
Listen, Staros.
You're not gonna take your men

494
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:07,922
around into the jungle
to avoid a goddamn fight!

495
01:07:08,006 --> 01:07:13,553
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack
right now with every man at your disposal!

496
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:16,514
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

497
01:07:25,899 --> 01:07:28,860
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

498
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:47,295
- There it is, right there. See it?
- I don't see it.

499
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:50,840
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

500
01:07:54,386 --> 01:07:59,849
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

501
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:04,813
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

502
01:08:04,896 --> 01:08:09,901
I have two witnesses here. I request that
you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

503
01:08:15,073 --> 01:08:18,618
Staros, don't pull this
guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

504
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:22,831
Now, l know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law.

505
01:08:22,914 --> 01:08:25,166
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

506
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:30,130
Now, I want that frontal attack.
I repeat my order. Over.

507
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:33,883
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there
in a frontal attack.

508
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,136
It's suicide, sir.

509
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:41,391
I've lived with these men for two years, and
I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

510
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,986
This is a very important decision, Staros.

511
01:08:56,573 --> 01:09:00,410
But if you feel that strongly, maybe
you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

512
01:09:00,493 --> 01:09:02,871
Go take a look.

513
01:09:02,954 --> 01:09:05,665
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

514
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:10,587
but if I find extenuating circumstances
when I get there, I'll take that into account.

515
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:14,966
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there.

516
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:19,262
And, if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

517
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:35,111
One spot's as good as another, men.

518
01:09:35,195 --> 01:09:37,280
There's no place to hide.

519
01:09:41,785 --> 01:09:46,289
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

520
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,751
Where's... where's Fife?

521
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:52,045
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

522
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,756
Hold my hand, Fife.

523
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:57,759
Hold my hand.

524
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:04,933
I got it.

525
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:11,022
I'm dying, Fife.

526
01:10:38,049 --> 01:10:40,218
Oh, Captain...

527
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,603
Shut up in a tomb.

528
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:35,857
Can't lift the lid.

529
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:40,403
Played a role l never conceived.

530
01:11:40,778 --> 01:11:44,699
Get that blouse on, soldier.
It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

531
01:11:44,782 --> 01:11:46,451
Put it on right now.

532
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:49,913
What you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

533
01:11:49,996 --> 01:11:52,081
Move up!

534
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:05,595
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

535
01:12:11,184 --> 01:12:14,479
Observing, sir. Just sent
First Platoon forward to the ridge.

536
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:18,191
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

537
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:20,360
None? Not one?

538
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:25,323
Doesn't sound like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

539
01:12:25,406 --> 01:12:29,994
Well, it's not. The situation's changed
just in the last five minutes, sir.

540
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:35,625
Captain, you listen to me.

541
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:38,336
We're going over there
and taking everybody with us.

542
01:12:38,419 --> 01:12:40,922
Do you have any more complaints
or demurrers?

543
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:45,677
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right! We're gonna do things my way!

544
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,179
My way! You understand that, Captain?

545
01:12:48,262 --> 01:12:52,558
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

546
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:56,521
I think the ridge
is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

547
01:13:03,695 --> 01:13:06,197
Show me how to see things the way you do.

548
01:13:09,409 --> 01:13:11,744
Show me how to see things the way you do.

549
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:18,209
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

550
01:13:41,816 --> 01:13:44,319
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

551
01:13:44,402 --> 01:13:47,655
Bell, take six men

552
01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:49,824
and go see what's up there.

553
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:58,249
And we'll cover you the best we can
from down there.

554
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:19,455
OK.

555
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:22,041
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

556
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,253
I'm going alone.

557
01:17:04,852 --> 01:17:06,938
Come out.

558
01:17:12,276 --> 01:17:14,362
Come out where lam.

559
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:25,600
There was a... There was a...

560
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:29,604
There's a bunker... up there.

561
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,524
It's five guns.

562
01:18:33,858 --> 01:18:36,152
It's five guns.

563
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:45,453
That strongpoint up there,
somewhere up there around those rocks,

564
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:47,622
is the key to this ridge.

565
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,835
Bell here is quite right.

566
01:18:52,918 --> 01:18:58,633
From their knob up there, those little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the ground

567
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:03,054
in front of this position for 1,000 yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.

568
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:07,099
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.

569
01:19:07,183 --> 01:19:11,354
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

570
01:19:13,773 --> 01:19:17,234
All right, all right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted,

571
01:19:17,318 --> 01:19:20,780
and we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

572
01:19:21,655 --> 01:19:24,575
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

573
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:30,373
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

574
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:35,544
So I'm asking for volunteers.

575
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:37,880
Go back up there and knock it out.

576
01:19:37,963 --> 01:19:40,049
Sir?

577
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:42,218
I'll be glad to go back up

578
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:44,637
- and lead the way back for a party.
- Right.

579
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,430
- I'll go, sir.
- You.

580
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:48,641
All right.

581
01:19:48,724 --> 01:19:53,562
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

582
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:56,565
- You'll be in command.
- I'll go, sir.

583
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:58,025
- Sir?
- You.

584
01:19:58,109 --> 01:20:02,113
All right, men, that's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

585
01:20:05,908 --> 01:20:10,413
I don't know if you realise the importance
of this operation, Staros.

586
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,000
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

587
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:19,046
That means air power
for 1,000 miles in every direction.

588
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:23,592
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

589
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:28,305
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

590
01:20:31,434 --> 01:20:34,437
I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

591
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,731
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

592
01:20:37,815 --> 01:20:39,900
I can't say, sir.

593
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:51,036
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

594
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:52,413
How many? One? Two?

595
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:56,459
Twenty?

596
01:20:57,877 --> 01:21:01,005
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

597
01:21:02,339 --> 01:21:06,761
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

598
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:11,557
No, sir. You're right...
about everything you said.

599
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,726
Fine, fine.

600
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:15,895
That's all, Captain.

601
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:19,690
One more thing, Staros.

602
01:21:20,441 --> 01:21:24,737
It's not necessary for you
to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

603
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:26,989
Ever.

604
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:29,408
We'll assume it.

605
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:31,368
Dismissed.

606
01:21:48,177 --> 01:21:50,262
I feel sorry for you, kid.

607
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:53,724
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

608
01:21:57,186 --> 01:21:59,271
This army's gonna kill you.

609
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:08,739
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

610
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:12,993
You're just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

611
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:30,678
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

612
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:38,644
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

613
01:22:42,773 --> 01:22:47,444
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be OK.

614
01:22:47,528 --> 01:22:49,613
There's just this one.

615
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:53,617
Just this rock.

616
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:33,073
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

617
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:36,285
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

618
01:23:36,368 --> 01:23:39,079
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

619
01:23:40,956 --> 01:23:43,042
This is futile!

620
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:49,590
Look at me!
I stand right up here and not one bullet.

621
01:23:49,673 --> 01:23:51,759
Not one shot!

622
01:23:52,676 --> 01:23:54,553
Why?

623
01:23:54,845 --> 01:23:56,931
How come they all had to die?

624
01:23:57,014 --> 01:24:01,477
I can stand right here, I can stand right up
and nothing happens to me!

625
01:24:21,997 --> 01:24:24,083
We.

626
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:32,716
We together.

627
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:45,521
One being.

628
01:25:00,536 --> 01:25:02,830
Flow together like water,

629
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,419
till I can't tell you from me.

630
01:25:26,311 --> 01:25:28,397
I drink you.

631
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:32,526
Now.

632
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:36,947
Now.

633
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:15,652
You're my light.

634
01:26:18,906 --> 01:26:20,991
My guide.

635
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:33,522
John, I'll be behind you.
If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

636
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:36,150
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

637
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,403
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

638
01:29:33,725 --> 01:29:35,811
OK.

639
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:39,481
Stay down, below this ledge,

640
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:43,568
and I'll call down the data from above.

641
01:29:43,652 --> 01:29:48,240
Once the 81s have plastered that rock...
as much as possible,

642
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:52,119
we're gonna crawl out
along that big rock for cover

643
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,706
and then flank 'em to the right.

644
01:29:55,789 --> 01:29:57,666
OK?

645
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:01,753
OK. OK.

646
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:27,029
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

647
01:30:27,904 --> 01:30:30,240
100 left, add 200.

648
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:32,993
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

649
01:30:33,076 --> 01:30:36,121
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

650
01:30:36,204 --> 01:30:39,416
Left 100, add 200.

651
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:43,378
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

652
01:30:43,462 --> 01:30:46,214
Understand. 1470 from EasyRoger 7.

653
01:31:00,604 --> 01:31:02,689
Left 25, drop 50!

654
01:31:03,857 --> 01:31:05,942
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

655
01:31:06,026 --> 01:31:08,320
Left 25, drop 50.

656
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:10,489
Fire for effect. Over.

657
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:12,824
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

658
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,848
Let's go!

659
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,700
OK, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

660
01:31:55,784 --> 01:32:00,038
Nobody fire or throw the grenades
till I give the signal.

661
01:32:00,122 --> 01:32:02,207
OK, let's do it.

662
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:19,808
Is he OK? ls he all right?

663
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:22,269
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

664
01:32:22,352 --> 01:32:26,398
- No, we can't leave him here.
- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

665
01:32:26,481 --> 01:32:30,485
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back,... if he's still alive.

666
01:32:34,364 --> 01:32:36,783
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

667
01:32:36,867 --> 01:32:40,454
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

668
01:33:05,187 --> 01:33:06,271
Behind you!

669
01:33:21,703 --> 01:33:23,788
We're pinned down!

670
01:33:53,735 --> 01:33:55,820
Fall back!

671
01:34:00,784 --> 01:34:02,244
Go!

672
01:35:13,356 --> 01:35:15,442
Watch out.

673
01:35:54,064 --> 01:35:55,523
Clear!

674
01:36:47,742 --> 01:36:49,828
Come on. Get out.

675
01:36:51,204 --> 01:36:53,289
Go on.

676
01:36:56,292 --> 01:36:58,378
Think you're soldiers?

677
01:37:05,385 --> 01:37:07,637
You piece of shit!

678
01:37:13,893 --> 01:37:15,770
Son of a bitch!

679
01:37:15,854 --> 01:37:17,939
Son of a bitch!

680
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:39,043
All right?

681
01:37:41,796 --> 01:37:43,882
I shot a man.

682
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:21,211
Stinks around here.

683
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:25,965
- All these dead people.
- Put a cigarette up your nose.

684
01:39:48,089 --> 01:39:50,550
Look at 'em move!

685
01:39:50,633 --> 01:39:52,385
Look at 'em move!

686
01:39:52,468 --> 01:39:54,345
We got 'em on the run!

687
01:39:54,429 --> 01:39:57,640
Way to go, John. When they saw you
make that attack and win,

688
01:39:57,724 --> 01:40:00,268
you put their hearts back into them.

689
01:40:00,351 --> 01:40:02,562
- Hey, hey!
- Don't do that, soldier.

690
01:40:02,645 --> 01:40:07,483
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.

691
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:10,028
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

692
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:12,864
Sir, I've a few recommendations
for decorations.

693
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:16,492
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em
that we can, but later.

694
01:40:16,576 --> 01:40:21,039
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.

695
01:40:21,122 --> 01:40:22,582
Perhaps the big one.

696
01:40:22,665 --> 01:40:25,752
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...
- Yes, you do, John.

697
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:28,671
Getting it for you
will be the goddamn problem!

698
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:33,176
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion
and the regiment, if you did get it.

699
01:40:33,259 --> 01:40:34,927
We better move out.

700
01:40:35,011 --> 01:40:39,557
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

701
01:40:39,641 --> 01:40:42,602
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company?

702
01:40:42,685 --> 01:40:43,728
Of course.

703
01:40:43,811 --> 01:40:48,441
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but about the water. If we don't get water...

704
01:40:48,524 --> 01:40:50,610
Don't worry about water.

705
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:57,367
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours now we have the momentum.

706
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:00,995
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

707
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:03,164
I've arranged for that.

708
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:07,293
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,
and wait for it.

709
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:09,253
No, sir.

710
01:41:09,337 --> 01:41:11,547
That's right.

711
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:17,428
And if some of the men... pass out,
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

712
01:41:21,224 --> 01:41:23,101
All right.

713
01:41:23,184 --> 01:41:24,644
They could...

714
01:41:24,727 --> 01:41:28,064
- They could die from it.
- They could die from enemy fire, too!

715
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:31,693
They're all tough boys.

716
01:41:36,447 --> 01:41:41,577
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see
plenty more of those where we're going!

717
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:44,247
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

718
01:41:48,126 --> 01:41:52,088
John, I'm convinced that
the Japanese position can be broken now.

719
01:41:52,171 --> 01:41:57,260
All we have to do is keep going and we'll
have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

720
01:41:57,343 --> 01:42:00,346
You see the spirit in these men?
D'you see the new spirit?

721
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:05,601
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

722
01:42:05,685 --> 01:42:08,563
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

723
01:42:08,646 --> 01:42:12,316
or even to have it reinforced
from troops from the reserves,

724
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,570
if we were to stall
before reaching the top, well,

725
01:42:15,653 --> 01:42:19,907
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

726
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:22,368
I've waited all my life for this.

727
01:42:22,452 --> 01:42:26,998
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

728
01:42:27,081 --> 01:42:29,542
And I don't intend to give it up now.

729
01:42:32,712 --> 01:42:36,382
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

730
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:39,635
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the Academy.

731
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:45,391
You're, you know, you've got your war!
This 15 years, this is my first war!

732
01:42:50,855 --> 01:42:54,192
John, some day you'll understand.

733
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:02,158
You're like a son to me, John.

734
01:43:04,535 --> 01:43:06,621
You know what my son does?

735
01:43:07,538 --> 01:43:09,624
He's a bait salesman.

736
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:14,295
You've done a hell of a job, John.

737
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:19,258
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything,
everything that you deserve.

738
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:23,596
Thank you, sir.

739
01:43:25,681 --> 01:43:27,767
God...

740
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:31,312
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

741
01:43:31,395 --> 01:43:33,064
Get me three runners!

742
01:43:33,147 --> 01:43:35,399
You go back to the rear to find water

743
01:43:35,483 --> 01:43:38,361
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

744
01:43:39,278 --> 01:43:42,490
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

745
01:43:42,573 --> 01:43:45,076
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

746
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:47,245
It's high ground by nightfall!

747
01:44:11,394 --> 01:44:13,938
You seen many dead people?

748
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,691
Plenty.

749
01:44:16,774 --> 01:44:19,402
They're no different than dead dogs,

750
01:44:20,111 --> 01:44:22,196
once you get used to the idea.

751
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:29,120
They're meat, kid.

752
01:44:45,177 --> 01:44:48,139
Are you righteous? Kind?

753
01:44:51,225 --> 01:44:53,394
Does your confidence lie in this?

754
01:44:56,814 --> 01:44:58,900
Are you loved by all?

755
01:45:01,194 --> 01:45:03,279
Know that l was, too.

756
01:45:06,866 --> 01:45:11,537
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less
because you loved goodness?

757
01:45:12,163 --> 01:45:14,248
Truth?

758
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:15,823
Get fucking on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

759
01:49:16,574 --> 01:49:18,659
Get down. Stay there.

760
01:49:27,126 --> 01:49:31,005
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

761
01:49:31,088 --> 01:49:32,965
Now!

762
01:50:32,691 --> 01:50:34,777
This great evil.

763
01:50:37,529 --> 01:50:39,615
Where's it come from?

764
01:50:44,286 --> 01:50:46,372
How'd it steal into the world?

765
01:50:58,133 --> 01:51:01,679
What seed, what root did it grow from?

766
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,686
Who's doing this?

767
01:51:11,272 --> 01:51:13,357
Who's killing us?

768
01:51:17,319 --> 01:51:19,822
Robbing us of life and light.

769
01:51:24,577 --> 01:51:27,997
Mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known.

770
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:56,692
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

771
01:51:59,069 --> 01:52:02,698
Does it help the grass to grow
or the sun to shine?

772
01:52:08,871 --> 01:52:11,165
Is this darkness in you, too?

773
01:52:17,629 --> 01:52:19,965
Have you passed through this night?

774
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,724
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

775
01:52:32,436 --> 01:52:34,521
You're dying.

776
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:48,577
See them birds up there?

777
01:52:50,329 --> 01:52:52,623
You know they eat you raw?

778
01:52:57,544 --> 01:53:00,714
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

779
01:54:12,202 --> 01:54:14,288
What are you to me?

780
01:54:20,085 --> 01:54:22,171
Nothing.

781
01:56:43,395 --> 01:56:45,480
Have a seat here.

782
01:56:55,741 --> 01:56:58,535
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

783
01:57:01,913 --> 01:57:04,291
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

784
01:57:06,001 --> 01:57:08,086
I already told him.

785
01:57:18,472 --> 01:57:20,766
It's a hard thing to do.

786
01:57:21,558 --> 01:57:23,644
Difficult decision to make.

787
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:28,940
I don't think you're tough enough.

788
01:57:30,442 --> 01:57:35,447
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted.
You're not tough-fibred enough.

789
01:57:39,993 --> 01:57:43,955
Anyway, it's my decision to make.
I've already made it.

790
01:57:44,665 --> 01:57:47,167
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

791
01:57:55,425 --> 01:57:58,637
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

792
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,014
Have you?

793
01:58:13,652 --> 01:58:16,613
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

794
01:58:16,697 --> 01:58:22,119
I don't want it in the records of the battalion.
There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

795
01:58:22,202 --> 01:58:25,789
This has nothing to do with
cowardice or inefficiency.

796
01:58:29,084 --> 01:58:31,378
Look at this jungle.

797
01:58:31,461 --> 01:58:36,800
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

798
01:58:39,219 --> 01:58:41,513
Nature's cruel, Staros.

799
01:58:50,772 --> 01:58:56,319
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment
to the Judge Advocate General Corps

800
01:58:56,403 --> 01:58:58,280
for reasons of ill health.

801
01:58:58,363 --> 01:58:59,740
You're a lawyer.

802
01:58:59,823 --> 01:59:02,200
- You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.

803
01:59:02,284 --> 01:59:04,661
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

804
01:59:04,745 --> 01:59:06,997
Anyway, you probably will have it.

805
01:59:07,664 --> 01:59:10,751
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star.

806
01:59:10,834 --> 01:59:15,005
And I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

807
01:59:15,922 --> 01:59:18,550
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

808
01:59:21,219 --> 01:59:22,888
Why?

809
01:59:22,971 --> 01:59:28,602
Because of that scratch on your face
and because of those cuts on your hands.

810
01:59:28,685 --> 01:59:30,353
Listen to me, Staros.

811
01:59:30,437 --> 01:59:34,483
I think it's best you go back with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

812
01:59:34,566 --> 01:59:38,361
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

813
01:59:38,445 --> 01:59:41,990
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

814
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:18,902
This is from Colonel Tall.

815
02:00:20,403 --> 02:00:23,907
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride".

816
02:00:24,991 --> 02:00:28,537
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal".

817
02:00:29,871 --> 02:00:34,876
"Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

818
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:40,215
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

819
02:00:41,675 --> 02:00:45,929
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line".

820
02:00:50,183 --> 02:00:51,643
That's all.

821
02:02:47,092 --> 02:02:49,177
Hours like months.

822
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:54,015
Days like years.

823
02:02:57,352 --> 02:02:59,437
Walked into the golden age.

824
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,986
Stood on the shores of the New World.

825
02:03:16,913 --> 02:03:19,874
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit,

826
02:03:19,958 --> 02:03:21,626
but...

827
02:03:24,754 --> 02:03:27,382
I just felt like being alone, you know?

828
02:03:29,175 --> 02:03:31,261
Yeah?

829
02:03:41,438 --> 02:03:43,523
We wanted to thank you, sir.

830
02:03:47,569 --> 02:03:50,071
For asking to make that flanking move.

831
02:03:52,157 --> 02:03:54,242
For watching out for us.

832
02:03:56,286 --> 02:03:58,371
Keeping us together.

833
02:04:03,543 --> 02:04:05,628
We're all sorry to see you go.

834
02:04:05,712 --> 02:04:07,881
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

835
02:04:10,133 --> 02:04:13,303
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

836
02:04:16,056 --> 02:04:17,932
Tough part is...

837
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:22,312
not knowing if you're doing any good.

838
02:04:24,189 --> 02:04:26,274
That's the hard part.

839
02:04:28,026 --> 02:04:30,653
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

840
02:04:31,488 --> 02:04:33,573
I'm glad to be going.

841
02:04:34,824 --> 02:04:36,785
I'm glad.

842
02:04:36,868 --> 02:04:40,663
- There's still time. We could file a complaint.
- For what?

843
02:04:41,748 --> 02:04:44,000
What good would that do?

844
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:47,378
Anyway, I wanna go.

845
02:04:50,298 --> 02:04:52,759
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

846
02:05:05,355 --> 02:05:07,440
What does that mean, sir?

847
02:05:10,151 --> 02:05:12,487
It means "You've been like my sons".

848
02:05:23,748 --> 02:05:25,834
You are my sons.

849
02:05:27,085 --> 02:05:29,170
My dear sons.

850
02:05:33,091 --> 02:05:35,176
You live inside me now.

851
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,266
I'll carry you wherever I go.

852
02:05:57,282 --> 02:06:00,076
Can't nothing make you forget it.

853
02:06:03,788 --> 02:06:06,291
Each time you start from scratch.

854
02:06:12,088 --> 02:06:14,716
War don't ennoble men.

855
02:06:15,758 --> 02:06:18,052
It turns 'em into dogs.

856
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:25,935
Poisons the soul.

857
02:07:29,916 --> 02:07:32,001
My dear wife,

858
02:07:34,754 --> 02:07:41,344
you get something twisted out of your
insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

859
02:07:50,812 --> 02:07:53,439
I wanna stay changeless for you.

860
02:07:56,025 --> 02:07:59,028
I wanna come back to you
the man I was before.

861
02:08:07,036 --> 02:08:09,747
How do we get to those other shores?

862
02:08:13,584 --> 02:08:15,670
To those blue hills.

863
02:08:25,888 --> 02:08:27,557
Love.

864
02:08:37,108 --> 02:08:39,193
Where does it come from?

865
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:49,746
Who lit this flame in us?

866
02:08:56,794 --> 02:08:58,880
No war can put it out,

867
02:09:00,381 --> 02:09:02,467
conquer it.

868
02:09:10,308 --> 02:09:12,393
I was a prisoner.

869
02:09:16,856 --> 02:09:18,941
You set me free.

870
02:09:23,071 --> 02:09:25,615
No matter how much training you got,

871
02:09:26,741 --> 02:09:28,826
how careful you are,

872
02:09:30,203 --> 02:09:33,664
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.

873
02:09:33,748 --> 02:09:39,003
Makes no difference who you are,
or how tough a guy you might be,

874
02:09:41,047 --> 02:09:45,468
if you're in the wrong spot
at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

875
02:09:56,187 --> 02:09:58,648
I look at that boy dying,

876
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:02,235
I don't feel nothing.

877
02:10:05,488 --> 02:10:08,157
I don't care about nothing any more.

878
02:10:12,829 --> 02:10:14,914
Sounds like bliss.

879
02:10:19,377 --> 02:10:21,462
I don't have that feeling yet.

880
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,966
That numbness.

881
02:10:26,008 --> 02:10:28,094
Not like the rest of you guys.

882
02:10:32,432 --> 02:10:34,725
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

883
02:10:37,937 --> 02:10:40,189
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

884
02:11:23,983 --> 02:11:27,487
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

885
02:11:28,571 --> 02:11:30,656
Or talked to one.

886
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:36,746
I don't wanna...

887
02:11:37,455 --> 02:11:39,999
I don't wanna feel the desire.

888
02:12:17,119 --> 02:12:18,788
All right. Abrahams!

889
02:12:18,871 --> 02:12:20,540
Abrahams. Here you go.

890
02:12:20,623 --> 02:12:22,500
Stack! Where's Stack?

891
02:12:22,583 --> 02:12:24,627
Bring him out.

892
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,796
Bell?

893
02:12:26,879 --> 02:12:28,756
Bell!

894
02:12:29,799 --> 02:12:32,301
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

895
02:12:35,054 --> 02:12:37,139
Dear Jack,

896
02:12:38,933 --> 02:12:44,105
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.

897
02:12:46,816 --> 02:12:49,110
I want a divorce to marry him.

898
02:12:55,449 --> 02:12:59,036
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway,

899
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:01,914
out of the memory of what we had together.

900
02:13:08,671 --> 02:13:10,756
Forgive me.

901
02:13:11,716 --> 02:13:14,302
It just got too lonely, Jack.

902
02:13:34,614 --> 02:13:36,699
We'll meet again some day.

903
02:13:40,494 --> 02:13:44,457
People who have been as close as we've been
always meet again.

904
02:13:52,923 --> 02:13:55,760
I have no right to speak to you this way.

905
02:13:55,843 --> 02:13:58,137
I can't stop myself.

906
02:13:58,638 --> 02:14:00,723
A habit so strong.

907
02:14:02,892 --> 02:14:05,519
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

908
02:14:09,649 --> 02:14:11,734
Help me leave you!

909
02:15:39,029 --> 02:15:41,115
What's your name?

910
02:16:53,145 --> 02:16:55,231
We were a family.

911
02:16:58,484 --> 02:17:01,070
How'd it break up and come apart?

912
02:17:04,323 --> 02:17:07,827
So that now we're turned against each other.

913
02:17:09,703 --> 02:17:12,289
Each standing in the other's light.

914
02:17:21,507 --> 02:17:24,134
How did we lose the good that was given us?

915
02:17:25,928 --> 02:17:28,013
Let it slip away?

916
02:17:30,808 --> 02:17:32,893
Scatter it careless?

917
02:17:53,581 --> 02:17:56,000
What's keeping us from reaching out?

918
02:17:56,625 --> 02:17:58,711
Touching the glory?

919
02:18:00,754 --> 02:18:04,508
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,

920
02:18:04,592 --> 02:18:06,677
Long ago.

921
02:18:08,262 --> 02:18:10,347
They leave you here?

922
02:18:11,891 --> 02:18:13,392
Yup.

923
02:18:13,475 --> 02:18:15,561
I slowed 'em up.

924
02:18:16,228 --> 02:18:18,147
Don't mind, really.

925
02:18:19,148 --> 02:18:21,942
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

926
02:18:22,067 --> 02:18:24,153
I got plenty of ammo.

927
02:18:26,822 --> 02:18:29,450
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

928
02:18:34,538 --> 02:18:36,832
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.

929
02:18:36,916 --> 02:18:38,626
Yeah.

930
02:18:38,709 --> 02:18:41,295
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

931
02:18:46,592 --> 02:18:50,179
- What you doin' down here?
- Just, you know,

932
02:18:50,262 --> 02:18:52,556
I'm heading back to the company.

933
02:18:53,223 --> 02:18:54,892
Yeah.

934
02:18:55,726 --> 02:18:58,020
Well, you give all them boys my best.

935
02:18:58,103 --> 02:19:00,564
You can come with me if you want.

936
02:19:00,648 --> 02:19:02,775
I'll help you along.

937
02:19:04,401 --> 02:19:06,987
No, it's nice and quiet.

938
02:19:07,071 --> 02:19:09,156
Peaceful up here.

939
02:19:11,533 --> 02:19:14,703
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

940
02:19:18,582 --> 02:19:20,668
I'll remind 'em.

941
02:19:21,126 --> 02:19:23,212
OK.

942
02:20:58,432 --> 02:21:00,517
Hey, Witt.

943
02:21:05,064 --> 02:21:07,232
Who you making trouble for today?

944
02:21:08,275 --> 02:21:10,361
What d'you mean?

945
02:21:11,111 --> 02:21:14,281
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

946
02:21:14,365 --> 02:21:17,034
Turn left when they say go right?

947
02:21:23,874 --> 02:21:26,376
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

948
02:21:28,796 --> 02:21:31,340
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

949
02:21:32,716 --> 02:21:34,802
I always felt like you did.

950
02:21:36,637 --> 02:21:39,348
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

951
02:21:40,641 --> 02:21:43,018
One day I can come up and talk to you,

952
02:21:44,061 --> 02:21:47,940
by the next day it's like we never even met.

953
02:22:02,287 --> 02:22:04,373
Lonely house now.

954
02:22:07,042 --> 02:22:09,128
You ever get lonely?

955
02:22:09,211 --> 02:22:11,296
Only around people.

956
02:22:13,215 --> 02:22:15,300
Only around people.

957
02:22:19,930 --> 02:22:23,350
You still believing in the beautiful light,
are you?

958
02:22:30,941 --> 02:22:33,026
How do you do that?

959
02:22:34,695 --> 02:22:36,780
You're a magician to me.

960
02:22:45,831 --> 02:22:47,916
I still see a spark in you.

961
02:23:13,192 --> 02:23:18,739
One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

962
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:23,535
But death's got the final word.

963
02:23:26,622 --> 02:23:28,707
It's laughing at him.

964
02:23:38,008 --> 02:23:40,510
Another man sees that same bird,

965
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:45,516
feels the glory.

966
02:23:50,562 --> 02:23:53,065
Feels something smiling through him.

967
02:24:50,414 --> 02:24:52,874
We need to get out of here right now.

968
02:24:52,958 --> 02:24:57,546
- You explain to... headquarters the situation?
- No.

969
02:24:57,629 --> 02:25:01,717
Do they know where we are?
Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

970
02:25:02,884 --> 02:25:06,430
Well, I think that's...
up to me to judge, Sergeant.

971
02:25:08,056 --> 02:25:13,645
I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are. OK?

972
02:25:13,729 --> 02:25:15,606
It's easy.

973
02:25:15,689 --> 02:25:19,067
Hey, Weld...
get headquarters on that thing.

974
02:25:19,151 --> 02:25:21,069
The fire's coming closer, sir.

975
02:25:21,153 --> 02:25:22,195
Line's cut!

976
02:25:25,198 --> 02:25:29,369
We need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut.

977
02:25:29,453 --> 02:25:32,080
And we need to find out how close they are.

978
02:25:32,164 --> 02:25:33,707
Come on.

979
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:36,335
OK. OK.

980
02:25:40,464 --> 02:25:42,549
Hey, you.

981
02:25:43,175 --> 02:25:44,426
You go.

982
02:25:45,427 --> 02:25:47,095
You're going, Fife.

983
02:25:52,726 --> 02:25:55,729
Coombs. You go, too.

984
02:25:55,812 --> 02:25:57,481
Come on!

985
02:25:57,564 --> 02:26:02,110
I'll go. I want you to know
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

986
02:26:02,194 --> 02:26:07,240
If they come down here in any strength,
Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

987
02:26:07,324 --> 02:26:09,785
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

988
02:26:09,868 --> 02:26:14,998
No, I wanna go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I wanna be there.

989
02:26:15,082 --> 02:26:17,584
All right. You stay by the river.

990
02:26:17,668 --> 02:26:20,587
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

991
02:26:20,670 --> 02:26:22,756
I will.

992
02:26:22,839 --> 02:26:24,800
Good luck, Witt.

993
02:26:24,883 --> 02:26:27,010
You OK, Fife?

994
02:27:54,181 --> 02:27:56,808
A reinforce battalion.

995
02:27:58,393 --> 02:28:00,061
We need to go back.

996
02:28:00,145 --> 02:28:02,022
Tell the lieutenant.

997
02:28:05,817 --> 02:28:07,694
Let's go.

998
02:28:24,961 --> 02:28:27,047
I'm hit!

999
02:29:25,981 --> 02:29:28,775
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

1000
02:29:35,907 --> 02:29:37,993
We'll be all right.

1001
02:29:42,998 --> 02:29:46,001
My friend here doesn't have long,

1002
02:29:46,084 --> 02:29:49,004
so... you go.

1003
02:29:50,213 --> 02:29:51,673
You go on ahead.

1004
02:30:14,905 --> 02:30:16,990
Witt!

1005
02:31:02,827 --> 02:31:04,913
They're coming.

1006
02:31:06,373 --> 02:31:09,709
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1007
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:14,631
Just hide out here till you hear firing,
then push on down the river.

1008
02:31:14,714 --> 02:31:16,174
No.

1009
02:31:56,423 --> 02:32:00,093
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1010
02:32:01,052 --> 02:32:03,138
Fall back.

1011
02:32:04,639 --> 02:32:07,183
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1012
02:32:13,398 --> 02:32:15,483
Fife, where's Witt?

1013
02:32:19,195 --> 02:32:22,198
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1014
02:34:05,552 --> 02:34:07,428
America.

1015
02:36:56,639 --> 02:36:58,725
Where's your spark now?

1016
02:37:21,497 --> 02:37:25,585
Now, I know you men have been
making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1017
02:37:25,668 --> 02:37:26,919
That's OK by me.

1018
02:37:27,003 --> 02:37:28,713
Everything a lie.

1019
02:37:28,796 --> 02:37:32,467
Any man in my outfit
can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1020
02:37:32,550 --> 02:37:34,677
Everything you hear and see.

1021
02:37:34,761 --> 02:37:38,931
As long as he's in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment given.

1022
02:37:39,015 --> 02:37:42,894
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

1023
02:37:42,977 --> 02:37:46,814
- So much to spew out.
- I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1024
02:37:46,898 --> 02:37:50,109
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

1025
02:37:50,193 --> 02:37:52,278
We are a family.

1026
02:37:53,363 --> 02:37:55,531
I'm the father.

1027
02:37:56,199 --> 02:37:59,285
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1028
02:37:59,368 --> 02:38:02,080
They just keep coming, one after another.

1029
02:38:02,163 --> 02:38:05,458
That makes you all the children in this family.

1030
02:38:05,541 --> 02:38:09,087
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

1031
02:38:09,170 --> 02:38:13,841
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

1032
02:38:13,925 --> 02:38:17,637
- If any of you wanna see me about anything,
- You're in a box.

1033
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:19,847
- anything at all,
- A moving box.

1034
02:38:19,931 --> 02:38:22,016
you will find that I am available.

1035
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:25,061
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.

1036
02:38:25,144 --> 02:38:28,106
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home...

1037
02:38:28,189 --> 02:38:30,274
They want you dead.

1038
02:38:32,652 --> 02:38:34,737
Or in their lie.

1039
02:38:39,951 --> 02:38:42,036
Only one thing a man can do.

1040
02:38:45,039 --> 02:38:47,125
Find something that's his.

1041
02:38:50,378 --> 02:38:52,463
Make an island for himself.

1042
02:39:05,935 --> 02:39:08,437
If I never meet you in this life,

1043
02:39:09,856 --> 02:39:11,941
Let me feel the lack.

1044
02:39:20,491 --> 02:39:24,912
A glance from your eyes,
and my life will be yours.

1045
02:40:14,045 --> 02:40:18,090
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.

1046
02:40:18,257 --> 02:40:22,845
I mean, I don't know what, you know,
what your plans are, but...

1047
02:40:22,929 --> 02:40:26,933
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1048
02:40:27,016 --> 02:40:30,353
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1049
02:40:31,062 --> 02:40:33,314
I'm ready to start living it good.

1050
02:40:33,397 --> 02:40:38,361
You know, my daddy always told me it's
gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1051
02:40:38,444 --> 02:40:42,990
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be
that hard when you're young.

1052
02:40:43,074 --> 02:40:46,744
Well, I figure after this
the worst is gonna be gone.

1053
02:40:47,453 --> 02:40:51,040
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1054
02:40:52,041 --> 02:40:54,126
That's what's gonna happen.

1055
02:40:55,253 --> 02:40:57,338
I'm getting older now.

1056
02:40:58,172 --> 02:41:00,675
By no means old, but older.

1057
02:41:01,467 --> 02:41:04,637
Where is it that we were together?

1058
02:41:07,807 --> 02:41:10,101
Who were you that I lived with?

1059
02:41:14,814 --> 02:41:16,899
Walked with?

1060
02:41:24,031 --> 02:41:26,117
The brother.

1061
02:41:32,623 --> 02:41:34,709
The friend.

1062
02:42:01,027 --> 02:42:03,112
Darkness from light.

1063
02:42:04,614 --> 02:42:06,699
Strife from love.

1064
02:42:07,867 --> 02:42:10,995
Are they the workings of one mind?

1065
02:42:12,371 --> 02:42:15,124
The features of the same face?

1066
02:42:30,014 --> 02:42:32,099
Oh, my soul,

1067
02:42:33,726 --> 02:42:35,811
Let me be in you now.

1068
02:42:41,859 --> 02:42:44,153
Look out through my eyes.

1069
02:42:45,446 --> 02:42:47,948
Look out at the things you made.

1070
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:55,164
All things shining.
