1
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,025
<i>If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat... stay home.</i>

2
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,237
<i>I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.</i>

3
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,114
<i>The source of the virus
was traced back...</i>

4
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:14,575
<i>to drug testing done at Gen-Sys
Laboratories in San Francisco.</i>

5
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,953
<i>The lab technician now
known as Patient Zero...</i>

6
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:20,873
<i>was accidentally exposed
to retrovirus ALZ-113....</i>

7
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:23,751
<i>an Alzheimer's trial drug that
was being tested on chimpanzees.</i>

8
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,088
<i>The infected chimps showed signs of
erratic and aggressive behavior...</i>

9
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,048
<i>that led to their escape
from the facility.</i>

10
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:31,426
<i>The now-famous incident on
the Golden Gate Bridge...</i>

11
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:36,139
<i>a six-hour standoff with police ended with
the apes disappearing into Muir woods.</i>

12
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,692
<i>Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...</i>

13
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:44,147
<i>- of what's being dubbed "The Simian Flu."
- The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...</i>

14
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:49,068
<i>ranging from 5 million to as many as
150 million in the next 6 to 8 months.</i>

15
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:53,615
<i>Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...</i>

16
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,242
<i>the airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.</i>

17
00:01:56,342 --> 00:02:00,330
<i>Many of the new arrivals are children who
have lost contact with their parents.</i>

18
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,957
<i>The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.</i>

19
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,669
<i>- Families are being ripped apart.
- Containment is not very likely.</i>

20
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:09,464
<i>Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.</i>

21
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:13,009
<i>The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.</i>

22
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,763
<i>Violence erupted in the city center tonight.
The third incident in as many days.</i>

23
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:21,184
<i>Martial law has been declared in 28
nations including the U.S. and Canada.</i>

24
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:24,286
<i>The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.</i>

25
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:28,858
<i>Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.</i>

26
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,486
<i>Due to the extremity of
the Simian Flu crisis...</i>

27
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,798
<i>all regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.</i>

28
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,536
<i>Those who aren't
killed by the virus...</i>

29
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,972
<i>will probably die in the fighting.</i>

30
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,793
<i>So, maybe this is it.</i>

31
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,003
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

32
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,105
<i>Pretty soon...</i>

33
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,275
<i>there won't be anyone left.</i>

34
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:00,742
Caesar...

35
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,718
They are close.

36
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,264
Koba!

37
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:29,370
Now, father?

38
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:35,436
Son, stay...

39
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:54,515
Thank you, Koba.

40
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,206
Think before you act, son.

41
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,814
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

42
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:32,279
Scars make you strong.

43
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,378
Come meet your new brother.

44
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,770
Another son.

45
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:18,445
Makes me think how far
we've come, Maurice.

46
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,052
Seems long ago.

47
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,667
Still think about them?

48
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:34,128
Humans?

49
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:38,549
Sometimes.

50
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:44,305
Didn't know them like you did.

51
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,893
Only saw their bad side.

52
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:53,647
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

53
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,484
Humans destroyed each other.

54
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,162
Apes fight too.

55
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:03,124
But we are family.

56
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:13,217
Wonder if they're really all gone.

57
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,403
Ten winters now...

58
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:19,673
Last two... no sign of them.

59
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,276
They must be gone.

60
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,236
That bear wouldn't get
me Blue Eyes. I'm quick!

61
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,630
Shut up, Ash!

62
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,478
Oh, God. It's okay.

63
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:28,609
It's okay. It's okay. Freeze!

64
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:46,677
Stay! Help!

65
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:50,014
Help! No!

66
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,349
Hey!

67
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,935
Over here!

68
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,773
I shot him! I shot him.

69
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,475
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

70
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,045
Rocket, wait...

71
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,178
We don't mean any harm!

72
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,657
They're apes, man. You think they
understand what you're saying?

73
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,660
Do they look like just apes to you?

74
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,742
- Dad.
- Malcolm, what are you doing?

75
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,160
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

76
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,844
It's okay.

77
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,418
Put your guns down.

78
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,854
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

79
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,698
Go!

80
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:34,785
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

81
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:39,440
Okay. Okay, we're going.

82
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,942
Go!

83
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,168
Slowly. Go, go, go!

84
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:49,800
- My bag!
- Go!

85
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,655
Koba!

86
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:14,825
Follow!

87
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:01,830
Did you find it?

88
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,942
We need to talk.

89
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:07,336
What? What's wrong?

90
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:09,998
The dam is pretty much intact.

91
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:12,617
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

92
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:15,302
But there is a problem. Get in.

93
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:29,634
I shot him. I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

94
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:34,055
- Jesus Christ. How many were there?
- There were a lot. There were like, 80.

95
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,390
- At least.
- Okay...

96
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,310
you're not hearing what
he's saying. They spoke!

97
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,695
That is not possible.

98
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,739
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

99
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,817
Incredible? They're talking apes!

100
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,786
- With big-ass spears!
- Please!

101
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:52,290
I don't know exactly what
you think you saw or heard...

102
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,784
but you have to calm down, okay?

103
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:57,812
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

104
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:01,149
We're all genetically immune or we
would've been dead a long time ago.

105
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:03,985
- You don't know that for sure.
- She worked with the CDC. She knows.

106
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,988
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

107
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,292
- We need that power.
- He could've killed us, but he didn't.

108
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:13,703
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

109
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:16,831
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

110
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,801
- What do you mean, "he"?
- That's what we're trying to tell you.

111
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:23,437
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

112
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:28,159
- He was remarkable.
- Really? Is that what you thought?

113
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,345
- It's what we saw.
- Yeah, it's what we all saw.

114
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:32,805
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

115
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,724
Not a word until we can
figure out what to do.

116
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:37,827
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

117
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:40,930
I don't want to create a panic.

118
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,543
How are you doing, pal? Are you okay?

119
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:03,545
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

120
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,839
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

121
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:09,092
Carver just told me we're not gonna
tell anybody what happened up there.

122
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,360
Not yet. No.

123
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,081
Must attack them now!

124
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,558
Before they attack us!

125
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,772
We don't know how many there are.
How many guns they have?

126
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,859
Or why they came up here?

127
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:01,728
They shot your son, Rocket!

128
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,746
Don't you want to fight?

129
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,750
I follow Caesar.

130
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:11,295
Koba's right!

131
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:15,257
They almost killed you, Ash!

132
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,680
No!

133
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,838
If we go to war...

134
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,867
We could lose all we've built...

135
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,821
Home.

136
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,408
Family.

137
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,543
Future.

138
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,636
I will decide by morning.

139
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,232
Caesar.

140
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,642
For years I was a
prisoner in their lab...

141
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:26,120
They cut me... Tortured me.

142
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,124
You freed me.

143
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,462
I would do anything you ask.

144
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,300
But we must show strength!

145
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:44,305
We will, Koba.

146
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:28,808
Coming through. Coming through.

147
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,706
That's a hell of a lot
more than eighty!

148
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,370
Malcolm!

149
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:54,744
Apes...

150
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,608
do not want war...

151
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:04,512
but will fight...

152
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:08,841
if we must.

153
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:43,526
Ape home.

154
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:49,324
Human home.

155
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:57,223
Do not come back.

156
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,473
Everyone!

157
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:43,344
Everyone, you have to calm down!

158
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,519
Everybody.

159
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,455
Everybody!

160
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,893
Please! We're all immune!

161
00:25:57,993 --> 00:26:02,839
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

162
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,899
How did they find us?

163
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,926
We found them.

164
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,470
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

165
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,431
Yeah!

166
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:14,267
If they come back...
If they come back...

167
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:17,112
they'll be sorry they ever did!

168
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,884
Now, this city may not have the manpower
it once did but it has the firepower.

169
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:27,804
Those stockpiles left behind by FEMA,

170
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:31,034
the National Guard, we have it all.

171
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,427
Look...

172
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,431
I know why you're scared.

173
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:41,378
I'm scared, too, believe me.

174
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:45,357
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

175
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:49,276
We've been through hell together.

176
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,882
But you all know what
we're up against.

177
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:00,538
We're almost out of fuel.

178
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,358
Which means no more power...

179
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:07,028
which means we could slip
back to the way things were.

180
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:11,432
That dam up there was the answer.

181
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:15,086
We just had no idea they
were up there, too.

182
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:18,706
- So, what do we do now?
- Yeah!

183
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:22,143
We find another way...

184
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:27,549
because that power... is not
just about keeping the lights on.

185
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:32,595
It's about giving us the tools to
reconnect to the rest of the world.

186
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:35,640
To find out who else is out there...

187
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,294
so that we can start to...
to rebuild...

188
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:44,248
and reclaim...

189
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,320
the world we lost.

190
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,818
That was a great speech.

191
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:01,265
There is no alternative power source.

192
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,894
That dam is the only option.

193
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,077
Well, then, we fight them.

194
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:19,517
We're two weeks away from running
out of fuel. Maybe three, tops.

195
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:23,104
- I know.
- And once that happens...

196
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:26,191
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

197
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,693
and calm everybody down.

198
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:32,780
We need that power to get
the radio transmitter working.

199
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,451
It's our only chance of
reaching the outside world.

200
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:38,495
We have to find other survivors.

201
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:42,098
Yeah. There's not
that many of us left.

202
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:47,029
- We can't afford any more casualties.
- We founded this place...

203
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:50,006
- you and I...
- I know.

204
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:54,385
...on the idea that power would lead
us back to the life we once had.

205
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:55,863
If we can't stick together,

206
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:58,940
- maybe we can't survive.
- I lost everything.

207
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:04,746
The idea of losing
what little I have is...

208
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,416
I want to go back up there.

209
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:15,388
Listen to me. Give me three days.
Let me talk to him. If it doesn't work,

210
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,396
- then we do it your way.
- And what if it backfires?

211
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:22,105
What if he gets violent? I mean, how do
you know that he'll even understand you?

212
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,353
He's more than just an ape.

213
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,841
I'm gonna take some
men up to Fort Point.

214
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:38,154
I'm gonna go through the armory.
I'm gonna see what's still working.

215
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:42,786
Three days. You're not back in
three days we're going up there,

216
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:45,367
and we're gonna kill
every last one of them.

217
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:03,997
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

218
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:07,308
He'll be here with Foster
and Kemp any minute.

219
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,503
You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

220
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:13,620
I don't really have any choice.
He used to work at the water department.

221
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,220
He's the only one who
knows how the dam works.

222
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:23,874
Malcolm... what are you gonna do
up there? What are you gonna say?

223
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:28,045
I'll tell him the truth.

224
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,048
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

225
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,264
You think I'm crazy.

226
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm worried.

227
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah, so am I.

228
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:47,381
I've gone over it in my head...

229
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:52,019
and I think if I don't
at least try this...

230
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:54,997
there's gonna be a war.

231
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:21,015
Take me with you. What if someone
gets hurt? You'll need me there.

232
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,920
I love you.

233
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:30,015
But I need you to stay here.

234
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,919
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

235
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,271
I'm coming, too.

236
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,534
Son, it's not safe.

237
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,113
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

238
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,242
I'm coming. Please.

239
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,131
No one gets out of the trucks.

240
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,675
No one.

241
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:24,779
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

242
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,531
It's gonna be okay.

243
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,716
Please. Please. Please. Please.

244
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,622
Please don't kill me.

245
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:40,442
Just hear what I have to say.

246
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,519
I know.

247
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:48,383
"Don't come back." I know. I just...

248
00:35:48,483 --> 00:35:50,301
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

249
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,695
Okay! Okay! Okay!

250
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:59,535
Okay, okay, okay.

251
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:04,649
I need to show you something.
It's not far.

252
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:09,170
- Human lies!
- No! No!

253
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,266
No, no, no. No, I swear.

254
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,656
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand. Please.

255
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:43,796
Show me.

256
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:10,381
This is what we used
to call a "small hydro."

257
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,301
It was built to service areas
to the north of here...

258
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:16,438
but we've been working to reroute
the power lines to the city...

259
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:19,390
because the city used to run off nuclear
power, but that ran out years ago.

260
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,976
So, we've been using diesel
generators and gasifiers.

261
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,896
But if we can just get
this dam working...

262
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:28,892
then we have a shot at
restoring limited power.

263
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:39,844
Is any of this making
any sense to you?

264
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,414
The... lights.

265
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,066
Yes.

266
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,935
The lights.

267
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,216
This is your home and I don't want
to take it away from you, I promise.

268
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:57,871
But if you can allow us...
let us do our work here...

269
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,448
You brought others?

270
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:05,962
Just a few.

271
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:10,283
I'm not a threat. If I am...

272
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:13,803
then I guess you can kill me.

273
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:40,322
Come on!

274
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,493
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

275
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:58,973
We need to give them our guns.

276
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:03,128
That's the one condition.

277
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:07,607
- What does that mean?
- We can stay.

278
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:25,558
If they get power,
they'll be more dangerous!

279
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,393
Why help them?!

280
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:30,079
They seem desperate...

281
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:33,274
If we make them go, they'll attack.

282
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:35,401
Let them.

283
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,022
We'll destroy them
while they're weak.

284
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:43,167
And how many apes will die?

285
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,340
We have one chance for peace...

286
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,601
Let them do their human work.
Then they'll go.

287
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,530
Human work?

288
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:02,019
Human work.

289
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,908
Human work.

290
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,502
Human work!

291
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,100
Koba say...

292
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,352
Apes should hate humans...

293
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:52,729
Enough!

294
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,190
From humans Koba learned hate...

295
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,416
But nothing else.

296
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,033
Hey. You need to eat.

297
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,594
Okay.

298
00:41:16,694 --> 00:41:19,480
That was brave, what you did today.

299
00:41:27,238 --> 00:41:30,767
Malcolm. I know everyone's
depending on you...

300
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:34,537
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

301
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:37,506
I care about him.

302
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:42,979
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

303
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,510
I know.

304
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:01,898
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

305
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,083
But...

306
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:06,569
You will.

307
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:13,593
You know the scary thing about them?

308
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:17,746
They don't need power, lights.

309
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:21,025
Heat. Nothing.

310
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,044
- Hey, pal.
- That's their advantage.

311
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:27,073
That's what makes them stronger.

312
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:29,909
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

313
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:31,862
With what? They took our guns.

314
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:33,705
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

315
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:38,100
Maybe they're just taking their time.
They killed off half the planet already.

316
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:39,169
Come on.

317
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:41,830
- What?
- You can't honestly blame the apes.

318
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,625
Who the hell else am I going
to blame? It was the Simian Flu.

319
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:49,086
It was a virus created by scientists in
a lab. The chimps they were testing on

320
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:52,515
- didn't have a say in the matter.
- Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

321
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:56,085
You're telling me you don't get sick
to your stomach at the sight of them?

322
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:02,358
- Didn't you have a little girl?
- Carver, that's enough.

323
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,894
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

324
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:05,236
Or your wife, for that matter.

325
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:08,606
Carver, you better shut up
before I kick your ass.

326
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:13,594
Okay.

327
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,516
I'm the asshole.

328
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:25,515
Are you okay?

329
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:48,546
You sound sick... You ok?

330
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:52,633
Just need rest.

331
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:02,010
You worry about the humans...

332
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:05,064
Where's Koba?

333
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:08,610
Still angry.

334
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:13,581
Said he was going hunting...

335
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:23,557
Look, humans below!

336
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:38,048
Why are we here?

337
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:41,259
Caesar trusts humans...

338
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:44,245
Koba does not.

339
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:48,149
- Most of the arsenal seems functional.
- Good.

340
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,117
We're testing them out back.

341
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:38,500
Hey!

342
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:44,722
Don't you move! Don't move,
do you understand me?

343
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:49,510
Terry! Terry, get in here, quick!

344
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:57,869
Holy shit.

345
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:03,683
What do we do? What do we do?

346
00:47:03,783 --> 00:47:05,701
Where did he come from?

347
00:47:05,952 --> 00:47:09,396
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

348
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:15,503
You are one ugly son
of a bitch, aren't you?

349
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,482
Whoa, man.

350
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,096
Dude, I think he's hungry.

351
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,599
He must have gotten
separated from the others.

352
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:49,370
You lost? Trying to get home?

353
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:52,640
Go on! Get out of here,
stupid monkey!

354
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,493
- Go on. You heard him. Go!
- Go! Go!

355
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:06,137
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

356
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:08,039
Must warn Caesar.

357
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:10,733
Who knows what humans
are really doing up there?

358
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:32,905
We gotta clear this blockage.

359
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,487
I didn't know you had a daughter.

360
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:46,261
Yeah.

361
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,459
What was her name?

362
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:00,008
Sarah.

363
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:06,547
I'm really sorry.

364
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,917
Well, now I have you
and your dad, so...

365
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:25,584
Yeah.

366
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:28,803
All right, you got that straight?

367
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:42,408
That's all the wire we got.

368
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:44,944
Brace yourselves.

369
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:50,241
Three... two... one.

370
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,349
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

371
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:05,657
Malcolm! Malcolm!

372
00:50:05,757 --> 00:50:07,091
Dad?

373
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:09,093
I can't see Carver.

374
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:33,726
Don't!

375
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,328
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

376
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,333
It's not broken.

377
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:44,454
Let go. Let go. Good.

378
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:58,025
Thank you.

379
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:01,084
You saved our lives.

380
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:03,918
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.
We might need a bit more time.

381
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,200
How long?

382
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,856
Hey, buddy.

383
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,782
Hey... hey...

384
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:57,034
What are you doing? Are you finished?

385
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,296
What are you looking at?

386
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:11,173
Hey! Hey!

387
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:14,009
Hey, get out of there!

388
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,600
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

389
00:52:26,113 --> 00:52:29,008
Don't! Don't! Caesar, no!

390
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:30,818
No.

391
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:49,879
Said no guns!

392
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,050
- No, don't.
- Please.

393
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:28,351
I didn't know.

394
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:39,220
Human leave now!

395
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:25,683
Man, we screwed now.

396
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,688
Malcolm?

397
00:54:30,939 --> 00:54:34,242
Malcolm, where are
you going? Malcolm.

398
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,292
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

399
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:49,607
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

400
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:53,043
This my home.

401
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:57,740
- You should not be here.
- I understand.

402
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,842
Malcolm.

403
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,274
She's sick.

404
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,328
How long has she been this way?

405
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:20,088
I have medicine.

406
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,907
Antibiotics.

407
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:27,127
Maybe she can help.

408
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,383
Do not trust you.

409
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:37,022
I don't blame you.

410
00:55:37,422 --> 00:55:41,576
But believe me...
we are not all like him.

411
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:43,677
Please.

412
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:47,048
Let us help you.

413
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,711
One day.

414
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:22,692
You stay one day.

415
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:27,097
- We might need a little more time.
- One day!

416
00:56:32,218 --> 00:56:34,362
Ape will help.

417
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:40,852
I will not help!

418
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:45,974
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

419
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:48,810
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

420
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,962
Come on, man.

421
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,019
Okay?

422
00:56:59,504 --> 00:57:02,298
Move, come on!

423
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:08,471
Get in!

424
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,371
See you tomorrow, asshole.

425
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:33,479
Just came from the city.
Humans very dangerous!

426
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,356
Where is Caesar?

427
00:57:39,294 --> 00:57:42,130
With the humans...

428
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:51,823
Yo, Alex. This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

429
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:53,682
Yeah.

430
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:17,081
Caesar.

431
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:23,412
Hey!

432
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:29,802
No! No, no, no, don't! No! No! No!

433
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:40,171
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

434
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:42,565
Caesar!

435
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:02,485
Humans attack your sons.

436
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:07,006
You let them stay!

437
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:12,136
Put apes in danger!

438
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,792
Caesar love humans more...

439
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:19,769
than apes!

440
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,007
More than your...

441
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:26,167
sons.

442
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,074
Ape...

443
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:17,310
not...

444
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:21,055
kill... ape.

445
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:51,219
Forgive me.

446
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:28,189
You are my son...

447
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:32,109
I need you to listen...

448
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:47,875
You didn't tell Caesar
about the guns we found?

449
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:52,914
Neither will you.

450
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:09,021
Your father doesn't trust me now.

451
01:02:09,647 --> 01:02:12,359
You need to protect him.

452
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:16,054
His love for humans...

453
01:02:16,154 --> 01:02:18,014
Makes him blind.

454
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,407
I know...

455
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:25,287
As long as they are here...

456
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:30,468
I fear for Caesar's life.

457
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:22,736
For yesterday.

458
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:48,980
Look. Look.

459
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,358
Watch. Watch.

460
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,668
"It was Friday.

461
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:57,797
"A real nice afternoon.

462
01:03:57,922 --> 01:04:00,007
"Warm.

463
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:05,705
"We were hanging... hanging...

464
01:04:05,805 --> 01:04:08,166
"We were hanging out...

465
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:11,519
"at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

466
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,139
Hanging out.

467
01:04:17,442 --> 01:04:19,360
Hanging.

468
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:23,923
Here. You can read?

469
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:36,544
Now, this is the good stuff.

470
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:41,173
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

471
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,084
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

472
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:56,013
No! No! Go!

473
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,110
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

474
01:05:01,986 --> 01:05:03,805
Hey, hey, hey!

475
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:05,906
Hey, hey.

476
01:05:09,994 --> 01:05:10,728
Hey.

477
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:13,931
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

478
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,571
- I think he likes you.
- Shut up.

479
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:21,922
All right, all right.

480
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,968
You want a drink, fugly?

481
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:27,620
Go on, give him some.

482
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,139
Give him some, man. See what happens.

483
01:05:33,142 --> 01:05:36,312
There you go. Whoa, hey!

484
01:05:38,189 --> 01:05:40,032
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

485
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:42,168
Shit!

486
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:49,216
- That's good, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

487
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:54,163
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay. All right.

488
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:56,691
- Easy.
- Yeah.

489
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,984
- Easy.
- Easy.

490
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,585
All right...

491
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:50,954
Malcolm! Malcolm!

492
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:54,098
What? What is it? What happened?

493
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,155
It worked.

494
01:08:33,781 --> 01:08:39,120
At least here it did. We'll know
when we get back to the city.

495
01:08:45,418 --> 01:08:46,828
Trust.

496
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:14,381
Son of a bitch.

497
01:09:14,781 --> 01:09:17,575
You son of a bitch!

498
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:06,082
The... lights.

499
01:10:35,612 --> 01:10:38,239
Feeling better?

500
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:17,954
Mother...?

501
01:12:28,558 --> 01:12:30,618
Human gun!

502
01:12:33,813 --> 01:12:35,289
Run.

503
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:53,466
Humans kill Caesar!

504
01:12:57,879 --> 01:13:00,239
Burn ape home!

505
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:14,087
Go! Get them!

506
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:18,357
Apes must attack human city!

507
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:21,010
Fight back!

508
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:25,364
Come, fight for Caesar!

509
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,728
Females and young stay in woods...

510
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,913
We go to the city!

511
01:13:41,214 --> 01:13:44,759
We will avenge your father's death!

512
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:00,775
Ellie! Ellie.

513
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:53,329
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this message...

514
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:57,658
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

515
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:12,072
Move, move!

516
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:29,824
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

517
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:33,870
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

518
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:38,174
If you are receiving this signal please state
your identity and your location. Over.

519
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:42,394
- What is it?
- The apes attacked the armory, sir.

520
01:16:45,106 --> 01:16:48,951
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

521
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:55,551
Move!

522
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:26,789
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

523
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,028
Let's go! Get into position.

524
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:38,184
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

525
01:17:38,284 --> 01:17:39,919
Good.

526
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:42,455
Listen to me.

527
01:17:42,664 --> 01:17:45,775
We are survivors!

528
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:48,236
Now, they may have got their
hands on some of our guns...

529
01:17:48,336 --> 01:17:50,830
but that does not make them men.

530
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:57,120
<i>They are animals! We will push
them back! Drive them down!</i>

531
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:01,240
And they will not get
through these doors!

532
01:18:39,253 --> 01:18:41,022
There! California Street!

533
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:30,531
Bring me the rocket launcher!

534
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:47,118
We have a beacon marking our location.
Please, we need help. We are under attack.

535
01:22:47,218 --> 01:22:48,870
<i>San Francisco. Repeat.</i>

536
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,239
- Hello?
<i>- Do you copy?</i>

537
01:23:17,498 --> 01:23:20,876
Humans escaping! Capture them!

538
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:45,001
We must be getting close.

539
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:53,784
I think I see it. It's down here!

540
01:23:57,246 --> 01:23:58,839
Dad!

541
01:24:14,723 --> 01:24:17,008
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

542
01:24:17,108 --> 01:24:19,226
Ellie, help me.

543
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:33,741
My...

544
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:35,743
son...

545
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:39,764
My...

546
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:42,541
family...

547
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:48,080
Where?

548
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,412
I don't know.

549
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:06,858
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

550
01:25:16,034 --> 01:25:18,160
Hold.

551
01:25:28,504 --> 01:25:31,566
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Is he going to make it?

552
01:25:31,966 --> 01:25:33,968
I don't understand.

553
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:36,921
Where did Carver get the gun?

554
01:25:37,555 --> 01:25:40,650
- Why would he do this?
- Ape...

555
01:25:42,894 --> 01:25:44,303
What?

556
01:25:47,148 --> 01:25:48,850
Ape...

557
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:50,993
did...

558
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:54,372
this.

559
01:26:01,371 --> 01:26:03,189
Get in the truck.

560
01:26:23,643 --> 01:26:26,880
Followed the humans here.
Hiding everywhere!

561
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:29,624
We must catch them all!

562
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:51,087
- Kill him.
- No, no, no.

563
01:26:56,175 --> 01:26:58,303
Go ahead Ash...

564
01:26:58,803 --> 01:27:02,098
make humans pay.

565
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:08,396
Caesar wouldn't want this.

566
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:50,396
Caesar gone...

567
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:58,263
Apes follow...

568
01:27:58,363 --> 01:28:00,782
Koba now.

569
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:26,374
- Oh, my God. Look, the colony's on fire.
- Where are we going to go?

570
01:28:26,474 --> 01:28:28,451
Caesar, what?

571
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:40,988
- Is this it? Are we close?
- Where is he taking us?

572
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:44,667
Malcolm, stop!

573
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:55,941
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

574
01:28:56,042 --> 01:28:58,062
It doesn't matter. We just
need a place to hide him...

575
01:28:58,163 --> 01:29:00,280
until we find out what's
going on at home.

576
01:29:04,846 --> 01:29:06,931
Go move the table.

577
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:12,862
Okay. Right here.

578
01:29:13,688 --> 01:29:14,889
Okay.

579
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:21,261
Dad, look.

580
01:29:22,405 --> 01:29:23,673
Look.

581
01:29:29,287 --> 01:29:32,123
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

582
01:29:32,749 --> 01:29:34,219
There's a surgical kit
back at the place,

583
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,485
- but that's...
- I'll go.

584
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:41,825
- It's not safe.
- He's the only one that can stop this.

585
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:46,129
Humans!

586
01:29:46,429 --> 01:29:50,083
You ape prisoner now!

587
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:54,220
You will know life in cage.

588
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:58,141
More humans out there.

589
01:29:58,241 --> 01:30:01,327
Go! Find them!

590
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,640
Maurice...?

591
01:30:23,091 --> 01:30:25,509
Koba said...

592
01:30:25,718 --> 01:30:28,496
we're too loyal to your father.

593
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,769
Protect yourself.

594
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:56,100
Shit!

595
01:33:05,795 --> 01:33:07,438
Hey, wait.

596
01:33:08,756 --> 01:33:10,416
Your father.

597
01:33:13,011 --> 01:33:15,113
He's alive.

598
01:33:27,317 --> 01:33:30,786
I got it. How is he?

599
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:57,880
Your... mother.

600
01:34:00,183 --> 01:34:02,059
Brother.

601
01:34:02,727 --> 01:34:04,262
Safe?

602
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,182
For now.

603
01:34:16,032 --> 01:34:17,192
No.

604
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:18,918
No.

605
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:24,790
Not human.

606
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:30,129
Koba.

607
01:34:34,008 --> 01:34:35,268
Malcolm.

608
01:34:35,718 --> 01:34:37,478
Yeah.

609
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,681
Caesar.

610
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:44,277
We need to do this now.

611
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:49,582
Son.

612
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,135
How is he?

613
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:30,072
We'll see.

614
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:33,776
He's very strong.

615
01:35:42,702 --> 01:35:45,004
It's gonna be okay.

616
01:36:17,946 --> 01:36:21,992
I'm so sorry... For everything.

617
01:36:24,077 --> 01:36:26,078
No.

618
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:31,317
I...

619
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:33,394
am to blame.

620
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:37,199
But Koba betrayed you.

621
01:36:37,799 --> 01:36:39,159
I...

622
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:43,387
chose to trust him...

623
01:36:43,554 --> 01:36:47,642
because he is ape.

624
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:51,429
I always think...

625
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:56,108
ape better than human.

626
01:36:57,902 --> 01:37:00,488
I see now...

627
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:06,160
how much like them we are.

628
01:37:10,665 --> 01:37:13,101
Where Koba now?

629
01:37:14,919 --> 01:37:17,713
On the human tower...

630
01:37:18,381 --> 01:37:20,075
Loyal apes around him.

631
01:37:20,175 --> 01:37:24,379
And those who not follow?

632
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:27,056
Prisoners.

633
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:31,852
Maurice. Rocket.

634
01:37:35,607 --> 01:37:38,000
Koba killed Ash.

635
01:37:44,365 --> 01:37:46,909
Fear makes others follow.

636
01:37:48,953 --> 01:37:51,205
But when they see you alive...

637
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:54,376
They will turn from Koba.

638
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:57,470
Not if I am weak.

639
01:38:00,048 --> 01:38:04,844
Ape always seek strongest branch.

640
01:38:07,472 --> 01:38:11,492
I must do something to stop him.

641
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:23,237
Father.

642
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:30,369
Let me help you.

643
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:23,631
Please, let us out of here!

644
01:41:42,812 --> 01:41:46,357
<i>Okay. Caesar, look.</i>

645
01:41:46,774 --> 01:41:50,094
<i>Apple. Apple.</i>

646
01:41:50,194 --> 01:41:52,213
<i>Good.</i>

647
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:56,700
<i>Home. Home.</i>

648
01:41:58,328 --> 01:42:00,204
<i>Home.</i>

649
01:42:01,456 --> 01:42:03,040
<i>Yes.</i>

650
01:42:04,459 --> 01:42:08,796
<i>This is your home. Your home.</i>

651
01:42:10,715 --> 01:42:13,250
<i>Good. Good.</i>

652
01:42:13,551 --> 01:42:15,636
<i>That's good.</i>

653
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:42,296
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

654
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,778
It's been two days.

655
01:42:54,467 --> 01:42:57,136
Your son is not back yet?

656
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:03,901
Who was that?

657
01:43:05,019 --> 01:43:06,846
On the video.

658
01:43:09,399 --> 01:43:13,235
A good man.

659
01:43:15,613 --> 01:43:17,849
Like you.

660
01:43:48,771 --> 01:43:50,673
They need to get to the
tower without being seen.

661
01:43:50,773 --> 01:43:53,234
I'm gonna take him
through the subway.

662
01:43:53,726 --> 01:43:54,936
I love you.

663
01:43:55,236 --> 01:43:58,556
Koba sent for the females and young.

664
01:43:58,656 --> 01:44:01,434
They're on their way.

665
01:44:01,534 --> 01:44:03,452
Mother too.

666
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:06,623
Must go. Now!

667
01:44:17,926 --> 01:44:19,593
Are you okay?

668
01:44:29,996 --> 01:44:34,217
Who's there? If you're human,
you better say so!

669
01:44:34,317 --> 01:44:38,112
It's me! It's Malcolm! Don't shoot!

670
01:44:39,697 --> 01:44:41,015
Stairs... take the stairs.

671
01:44:41,115 --> 01:44:44,952
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay? Go.

672
01:44:48,539 --> 01:44:49,999
Thank you.

673
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:52,326
Trust.

674
01:44:59,175 --> 01:45:03,271
All right, I'm coming out!
Don't shoot!

675
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:23,683
Hey! Look who I found.

676
01:45:23,783 --> 01:45:27,145
I didn't know if you'd made it out.
Good to see you.

677
01:45:27,245 --> 01:45:30,440
Don't worry. We're gonna
turn all this around.

678
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:34,277
- What do you mean? What's going on?
- The apes. They're all over the tower.

679
01:45:34,377 --> 01:45:37,322
- I lost the signal. It dropped out.
- Keep trying.

680
01:45:37,422 --> 01:45:39,423
Malcolm, look at this.

681
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,053
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

682
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:49,133
We just started setting them.
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

683
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:53,663
Blast them all at once.

684
01:45:54,063 --> 01:45:55,982
We could use your help.

685
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,841
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

686
01:46:37,941 --> 01:46:41,527
we ask that you identify yourself

687
01:46:45,114 --> 01:46:46,775
Here. Come on.

688
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:49,686
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

689
01:46:49,786 --> 01:46:51,837
and your location. Over.

690
01:46:59,963 --> 01:47:02,148
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

691
01:47:02,248 --> 01:47:07,094
If anyone is receiving this we ask that
you identify yourself and your location.

692
01:47:09,138 --> 01:47:11,599
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:21,301
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

694
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:23,194
and your location. Over.

695
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:28,791
Dreyfus.

696
01:47:32,304 --> 01:47:34,463
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

697
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:40,461
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you do this.

698
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:43,790
We need to give him a chance.

699
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:49,128
We need to give him some time.
He's up there right now.

700
01:47:51,514 --> 01:47:53,849
Who's up there?

701
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:36,225
Caesar has no place here.

702
01:48:37,685 --> 01:48:43,023
Apes follow Koba now.

703
01:48:46,110 --> 01:48:50,565
Follow Koba to war.

704
01:48:50,865 --> 01:48:53,951
Apes win war!

705
01:48:55,078 --> 01:48:58,873
Apes together strong!

706
01:49:03,544 --> 01:49:07,757
Caesar weak.

707
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:14,639
Koba weaker.

708
01:50:03,938 --> 01:50:07,024
Are you out of your fucking mind?

709
01:50:07,275 --> 01:50:10,378
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

710
01:50:11,112 --> 01:50:13,949
They want what we want, to survive.
They don't want a war.

711
01:50:14,049 --> 01:50:15,901
They're animals!

712
01:50:16,002 --> 01:50:18,431
- They attacked us!
- Because they thought we attacked them.

713
01:50:18,532 --> 01:50:22,606
Because they think that he's dead,
but he's not... Sit down, Finney!

714
01:50:22,807 --> 01:50:24,625
Sit down!

715
01:50:47,482 --> 01:50:49,601
Trusted Koba like brother.

716
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:53,496
Caesar brother to human!

717
01:50:55,657 --> 01:50:58,560
Koba fight for ape!

718
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,911
Free ape!

719
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:06,100
Kill ape. Koba fight for Koba.

720
01:51:14,842 --> 01:51:16,619
Koba...

721
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,531
belong in cage.

722
01:52:08,163 --> 01:52:12,574
- I know how this must sound.
- I don't think you have any...

723
01:52:17,447 --> 01:52:22,243
Do you think stopping me
will matter? They're coming.

724
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:26,130
Now, we made contact with
a military base up north.

725
01:52:26,289 --> 01:52:28,933
They're already on their way!

726
01:52:29,626 --> 01:52:31,052
It's true.

727
01:52:35,973 --> 01:52:38,292
Dreyfus! What are you doing, man?

728
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:51,605
- I'm saving the human race.
- No!

729
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:17,284
Ape not kill...

730
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,253
ape.

731
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:46,989
You are...

732
01:55:48,283 --> 01:55:50,318
not ape.

733
01:55:53,955 --> 01:55:56,040
No!

734
01:57:09,864 --> 01:57:11,466
Leave him!

735
01:57:29,217 --> 01:57:31,427
You're not safe here.

736
01:57:31,552 --> 01:57:34,547
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

737
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:37,391
You have to leave now. Everyone.

738
01:57:37,692 --> 01:57:41,504
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

739
01:57:41,604 --> 01:57:46,025
War has already...

740
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:48,235
begun.

741
01:57:49,737 --> 01:57:52,990
Ape started war.

742
01:57:55,618 --> 01:57:58,028
And human...

743
01:57:59,747 --> 01:58:03,292
Human will not forgive.

744
01:58:06,004 --> 01:58:09,791
You must go...

745
01:58:10,091 --> 01:58:14,303
before fighting begins.

746
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:17,932
I am sorry...

747
01:58:19,934 --> 01:58:22,954
my friend.

748
01:58:27,609 --> 01:58:30,186
I thought we had a chance.

749
01:58:33,865 --> 01:58:36,844
I did, too.
