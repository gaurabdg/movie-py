1
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,548
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,300
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

4
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,804
”It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,557
”that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont,

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,355
"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.

7
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,125
"'It's a white whale, I say 'resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,208
"SQ white whale-
Skin your eyes for him, men,

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,841
"'look sharp for white water,
if ye see but a bubble, sing out.

10
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,622
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
Jesus!

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,384
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,795
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,724
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
Yeah.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,393
She looks good.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,359
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,074
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,588
I got a little something for you.

22
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,755
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,086
She did.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,926
That's not for me any more, Tommy.

25
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,637
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,021
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,611
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,273
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,131
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,683
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,641
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,402
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,113
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,410
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,576
Here you go.

37
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,254
Coffee?

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,168
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

39
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,379
- Come on.
- I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,350
- Come on, it's just a drink.
- No.

42
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,968
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,221
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,015
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,499
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,341
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,806
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,592
Just 12.

49
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,684
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

50
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,445
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

51
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,653
But you were in the Marines.

52
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,901
That was all.

53
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,658
That was enough.

54
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
Well, that's too bad,

55
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,455
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

56
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,751
Who knew?

57
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,389
So, you gonna ask about her,

58
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,312
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

59
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,025
- I know.
- You know? What do you know? Huh?

60
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,316
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

61
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,114
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

62
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,911
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

63
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,285
And is that one of the 12 steps?

64
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,541
Or does a guy like you get 24?

65
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,206
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,171
in a shit box with no heat.

67
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,884
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,639
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,442
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,374
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,496
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,971
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,146
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,856
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,159
- What about if we all get a unicorn?
- No.

77
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,781
- Don't you want a unicorn?
- No.

78
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,412
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,164
- Oh, my goodness.
- Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,873
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,754
- Daddy, you look so handsome.
- Do I?

82
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,585
- He's a very pretty princess.
- We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,754
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,768
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,015
- Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
- Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,691
- All right! It's time for presents!
- I have to put this down.

87
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,735
- Here. You wanna put it down?
- Presents time!

88
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,733
- Everybody, come bring your presents!
- What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,613
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,948
- All right.
- Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,655
- What did you get? What did you get?
- Babe?

92
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,449
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,326
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,838
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,837
- This one's mine.
- Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,376
It's okay.

98
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,006
- I love you. Be good, okay?
- Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,343
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,846
- Hey, babe. I'm late.
- Hey.

101
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,352
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,810
- They've been fed, they just need a bath.
- I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,233
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,564
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,945
Where's the rest of that skirt?

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,360
Babe.

107
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,992
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,248
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,422
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

113
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,428
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,171
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,724
And we return here on MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,149
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
Fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

117
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,272
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

118
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Now, J-J-, what led to this project

119
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,822
that is really rede17ning
mixed martial arts here in the States?

120
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,363
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

121
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,116
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

122
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,995
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.

123
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,244
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

124
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,873
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

125
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,040
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

126
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,090
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J. J. Riley,

127
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,718
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

128
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,472
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta-..

129
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,598
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,725
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,058
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,811
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,402
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,653
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

136
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,164
So you want to join?

137
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,741
Sure.

138
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,538
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,673
Thank you.

140
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,684
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,021
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,314
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,853
- Acceleration.
- Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,273
If you have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,949
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,654
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Piece of cake.

148
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,328
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,867
Come on, man!

150
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,707
Come on, son!

151
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,623
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,633
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,675
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,048
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,764
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,310
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,476
- Yeah.
- Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
The third law...

159
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,483
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,398
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,354
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,321
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,324
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,748
For example,

165
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,999
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,788
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,626
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,009
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,346
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,850
All right, before you go,
I have your tests from last week.

171
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
Just work it out.

172
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Stop downing.

173
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,731
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,527
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,576
Use your right.

176
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,195
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,952
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,996
Go light!

179
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,045
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,126
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,170
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,175
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,264
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,353
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,140
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

186
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,147
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

189
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,899
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

190
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,405
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,699
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,497
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,756
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,301
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

196
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,093
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

197
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,685
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
Yeah.

199
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,608
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

200
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,739
All good.

201
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,074
- What's your name?
- Tommy.

202
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,753
- You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
- Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,290
Come on in.

204
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,262
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,306
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,514
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,813
Come on. Check that kick.

208
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,272
Easy.

209
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,987
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,828
- Good jab. Good jab!
- There we go!

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,247
- Dog, get up.
- Get up!

213
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,258
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,841
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,182
- Cover up!
- Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,743
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,097
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,268
- that came in.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,517
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,475
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,809
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,519
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,775
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,232
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,409
- Brendan.
- The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,494
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,288
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,909
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,666
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,418
- you understand?
- God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,841
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,431
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,764
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,228
- You told me.
- Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,600
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,481
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,316
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,369
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,285
- Heart.
- Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,746
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,871
All right, so, if that's my option,
I have no options.

246
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,207
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,089
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,215
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,969
My wife and I,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,677
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,313
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,976
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,152
It's a viable option.

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,152
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,616
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,834
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,676
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

258
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,305
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

259
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,602
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of Eve.

260
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,521
- Talking about Paddy Conlon?
- The controversial Paddy Conlon.

261
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,229
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

262
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,027
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.

264
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,111
And there it is! Wow!

265
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,118
There's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

266
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,788
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

267
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,618
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,793
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,504
- Who?
- Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,465
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,388
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,593
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

273
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,601
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,563
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,987
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,988
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,535
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,118
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,830
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,627
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,299
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,921
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,677
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,096
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,094
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,428
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,401
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

289
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,197
you gotta ask him yourself.

290
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,316
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

291
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,869
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

292
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,491
you gotta ask him yourself.

293
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,247
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

294
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,666
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

295
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,665
He doesn't live here.

296
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,998
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

297
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:01,144
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

298
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,353
I love you.

299
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,516
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

300
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,148
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

301
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,697
All right, sleep well.

302
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,244
You, too. All right, bye.

303
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,369
It's about time for your next contest.

304
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:31,799
Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

305
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:36,675
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

306
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,838
Say, "Uncle!"

307
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,431
Go, Mike. Go!

308
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:48,604
And his opponent in the blue corner,
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

309
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:53,067
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

310
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,661
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

311
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,624
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr Rick Fike.

312
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,247
Fighters to the center

313
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,004
Come on, gentlemen.

314
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,174
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

315
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,377
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

316
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,803
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

317
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,381
And on my signal, let's come out fighting.

318
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,348
Fighter, are you ready?

319
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,769
Are you ready?

320
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,024
Do it!

321
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,448
Come on, Mike, let's go!

322
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,086
You gotta move with that one.

323
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,309
Come on, Mike!

324
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,822
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

325
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,535
Get up, Mike, get up!

326
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,306
- First five minutes, out.
- Another 15? Great.

327
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,351
Hey! Hey, kid!

328
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,022
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

329
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,405
Hey, good job...

330
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,297
Hey, babe.

331
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,630
Hey.

332
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,575
How was work?

333
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,664
Oh, my God!

334
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,415
What happened?

335
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,543
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

336
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,473
I'm not bouncing at a club.

337
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,603
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

338
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,786
You've been lying to me?

339
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,625
I went in to apply

340
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,960
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

341
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,390
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

342
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,402
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

343
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,570
We're running out of options.

344
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,318
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

345
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,153
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

346
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,327
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

347
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,493
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

348
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,167
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

349
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,670
We're not giving up the house.

350
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,584
It's our home.

351
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,553
We're not going backwards.

352
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,394
We'll figure it Out.

353
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,482
This is what we're not going back to.

354
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,250
You wanted to talk?

355
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,135
Yeah.

356
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,674
I'm gonna start fighting.

357
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,555
Is that right?

358
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,681
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

359
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,104
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

360
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,682
Colt Boyd.

361
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,897
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

362
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,397
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

363
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,777
- Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

364
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,864
- Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
- Sure. Thank you.

365
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,989
All right.

366
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,166
There's this tournament,

367
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,827
it's a big tournament.

368
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,210
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

369
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,088
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

370
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,553
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do that.

371
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,515
But if I'm doing it,

372
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,647
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

373
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,476
Now, that much, you were good at.

374
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,024
What?

375
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,157
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

376
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,325
I'm serious.

377
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,452
We train. That's it.

378
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,076
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

379
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,702
You understand?

380
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,707
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

381
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,172
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

382
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,671
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

383
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,468
What about Colt Boyd?

384
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,046
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

385
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,552
- The devil you know.
- Excuse me?

386
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,682
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.

387
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

388
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,647
There's your coffee, hon.

389
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

390
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,200
Chasing Theogenes.
It'll be kind of like the old times.

391
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,945
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

392
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,832
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

393
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,750
All right. All right.

394
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,457
But you get something
through your skull, too.

395
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,713
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

396
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,887
And since this is about training,

397
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,842
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

398
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,847
I don't wanna see them.

399
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,062
In fact, hand them over right now.

400
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,975
I know they're on you, Tommy.

401
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,813
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

402
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,493
That's not gonna do.

403
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,253
When you came through that door, it was...

404
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,215
Three.

405
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,303
That'a boy.

406
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,686
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

407
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,938
This is for losers and old men.

408
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,688
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

409
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,024
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

410
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,778
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

411
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,655
You copy?

412
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,283
All right.

413
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,128
COPY...

414
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,468
Your brother's a liar.

415
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,053
- ...Went in the middle of the night...
- Yeah.

416
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,639
And he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

417
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,939
- No way.
- Front and center.

418
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,313
- Like MMA type stuff.
- You weren't there, so you don't know.

419
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,394
What's MMA?

420
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,444
- Mixed martial arts.
- Like, fighting.

421
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,897
Like, different styles of fighting.

422
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,323
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

423
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,701
It's true?

424
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,703
Take your seats.

425
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,125
Now, please.

426
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,388
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

427
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,882
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

428
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,516
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

429
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

430
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,606
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

431
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,605
- You have to tell us.
- Yeah.

432
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,949
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

433
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,141
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

434
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:57,317
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

435
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,862
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

436
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,152
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

437
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,110
Oh, man.

438
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,410
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

439
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,910
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

440
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,250
I need the money, Joe.

441
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,010
Yeah, but this is...

442
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,800
We can't have this.

443
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,224
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

444
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,185
Shit, Brendan.

445
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,184
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

446
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,106
are you out of your mind?

447
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,359
You're gonna get yourself killed.

448
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,027
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

449
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,605
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

450
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,198
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

451
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,240
I fought for a living.

452
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,832
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

453
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,627
Yeah, I guess you did.

454
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,092
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

455
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,011
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

456
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,181
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

457
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,891
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

458
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,345
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

459
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:19,358
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

460
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,810
This is a serious problem.

461
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,368
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

462
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,989
What are we gonna do?

463
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,080
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

464
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,129
and you say,
"It will never happen again, sir."

465
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,551
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

466
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,887
UFC?

467
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,678
Yeah.

468
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,393
Son of a bitch.

469
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,027
- Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
- Principal Zito.

470
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,130
What are you doing?

471
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,089
Well,

472
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,547
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

473
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,433
And we have an equipment malfunction.

474
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,189
How'd it go?

475
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:46,145
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

476
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:50,733
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

477
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,075
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

478
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,787
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

479
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,044
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

480
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,342
That's nice.

481
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,090
He said there's no precedent for this.

482
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,339
You'll be back by next semester.

483
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,424
The next semester?

484
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,190
Tess,

485
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,445
they have these smoker fights all over.

486
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:38,413
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

487
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,617
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

488
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,464
That could keep us afloat.

489
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:53,758
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

490
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,009
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

491
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,899
I would have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

492
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,818
Yeah.

493
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,945
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

494
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,575
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

495
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,122
Now, if you have a better solution,

496
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,502
I'm all ears, but...

497
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,963
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

498
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,099
It'll be fine.

499
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,768
I'll just leave the house as usual,

500
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,892
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

501
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,529
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack

502
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,417
And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!

503
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:10,664
But that rooster
That rooster, he knew everything

504
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:16,299
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

505
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,176
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

506
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,722
Look what I found

507
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,429
in that disaster of a...

508
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,810
basement

509
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,270
What do you say we sit down

510
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,489
and update this?

511
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,029
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

512
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,874
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

513
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,672
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

514
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,759
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

515
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,469
You can take that back
to where you found it,

516
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,021
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

517
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,895
I can pour that myself.

518
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,443
And I can wake myself up, too.

519
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,494
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

520
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,042
Yeah?

521
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:33,668
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

522
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,761
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

523
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,556
You can square your gear away.

524
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,354
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

525
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,852
Roger, sir.

526
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,060
Detail, a-ten-hut!

527
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,025
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

528
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,242
What's up, Mark?

529
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,911
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

530
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,034
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

531
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,786
- Did you see that? Oh, my God.
- What?

532
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:09,957
What's that?

533
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,754
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

534
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,296
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

535
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,840
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

536
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,669
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
- Wow. Oh, my God.

537
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,130
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Okay.

538
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,138
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

539
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,726
What's up, man?

540
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,935
Dude, what's his deal?

541
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,859
You're not gonna get your 11.

542
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,036
- AV, I need to see the tape.
- What tape?

543
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,038
- What tape?
- The tape!

544
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,369
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

545
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,787
Get the camera.

546
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,994
That's him.

547
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,253
That's him.

548
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,126
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

549
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,712
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

550
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,799
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

551
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,519
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

552
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,770
Good.

553
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,277
Good, good, good. Yos.

554
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:10,028
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

555
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,414
Do I know you?

556
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,126
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

557
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,049
- Long time, brother. Too long.
- How you doing?

558
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,422
- Too long.
- Look at your place.

559
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,502
- You like?
- Yeah.

560
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,431
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

561
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,383
- He's training for Sparta.
- Yeah, right.

562
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,844
Not bad, right?

563
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,644
It's amazing, man.

564
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,520
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

565
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,315
- You look good, brother.
- Thanks.

566
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,738
How are the girls?

567
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,661
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

568
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,742
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

569
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,121
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

570
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,287
You know,

571
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,255
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

572
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,177
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

573
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,253
- No. Come on.
- No.

574
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,924
Brendan, I'm sorry.

575
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,886
It's all good. She's good now.

576
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,936
- She's okay?
- So beautiful.

577
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:26,780
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

578
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,276
Yeah.

579
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,736
Well, I've got a little problem.

580
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,782
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

581
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,617
- What?
- Yeah.

582
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,212
That's kind of why
I came to see you, actually.

583
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,053
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

584
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,301
but how much do you need?

585
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,219
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

586
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,059
I mean, I was hoping that

587
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,522
you would train me.

588
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,307
Train you for what?

589
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,727
I wanna get back in the cage.

590
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,062
Are you serious?

591
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,821
Come on, Brendan.

592
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,736
I won an event the other night.

593
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,869
You won an event. That's what this is.

594
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:22,623
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

595
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:26,206
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

596
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,800
- Ish.
- Ish.

597
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,258
Brendan. I love you.

598
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,757
Why am I gonna train you?

599
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,431
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

600
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,514
You never listened to me.

601
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,976
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

602
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,155
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

603
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,780
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

604
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:58,454
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

605
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,454
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

606
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,708
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

607
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,262
I need to keep working the smokers.

608
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,718
Tess know about this?

609
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,223
Yeah?

610
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,522
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

611
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,476
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

612
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,686
I was unconscious.

613
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:33,694
- You were more than unconscious.
- I was.

614
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:38,119
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

615
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,869
It's not gonna happen.

616
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:42,995
What do you say, Frank?

617
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,869
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

618
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,043
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

619
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,171
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

620
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,848
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

621
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,299
That's all I need.

622
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,634
Great. All right.

623
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,185
Yeah.

624
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,309
- I appreciate it.
- What, are you kidding me?

625
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,682
- You need anything, you call me.
- I will.

626
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,108
Let me know when you're coming down.

627
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,732
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

628
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,146
Now?

629
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,300
Hey, Brendan.

630
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,682
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

631
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,518
What are you doing here?

632
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,736
I have some news for you.

633
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,655
Something wrong with your hands?

634
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,078
- No.
- If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

635
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,530
there's no reason for you not to phone.

636
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,161
- That's the deal.
- Yeah. I forgot.

637
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,288
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

638
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:12,417
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

639
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,089
Ever seen that?

640
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,843
I'm going inside.

641
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,262
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

642
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,757
Thousand days sober, today.

643
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,515
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

644
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,720
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

645
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,889
Have a heart, Brendan.

646
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,354
You listen to me.

647
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,482
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

648
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,652
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

649
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:43,077
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

650
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,372
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

651
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:51,708
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

652
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,208
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

653
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,459
it doesn't make it one for me.

654
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,540
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

655
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,297
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

656
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:02,176
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

657
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,052
I haven't seen in three years.

658
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,883
And another one I haven't even ever met.

659
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,974
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

660
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,976
Why is that?

661
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,105
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

662
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,107
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

663
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,489
That shit you pulled.

664
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,902
Never again.

665
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,453
And all that shit I saw growing up,

666
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,078
- that doesn't happen here.
- Look...

667
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,498
Take care of yourself.

668
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,790
Tommy's back.

669
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,098
He's in the 'Burgh.

670
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,766
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

671
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,144
Yeah, he came to see me.

672
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,610
He came to see you?

673
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,356
Yeah. He's over at the house.

674
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,410
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

675
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,200
You remember Fitzy's?

676
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,156
It ain't Fitzy's any more.

677
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,202
You and Tommy are training together?

678
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,953
Yeah.

679
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,964
- Tommy Conlon?
- Riordan.

680
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,050
- He's using your mother's maiden name.
- Yeah, I know what her name is.

681
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:26,848
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

682
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,974
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

683
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,303
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

684
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,184
That, too.

685
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,726
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

686
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,146
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

687
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,239
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

688
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,500
- Wow. Look at you.
- What?

689
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,747
Mr. Inside Man.

690
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,665
Inside? What?

691
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,799
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

692
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,592
- Look...
- Now I know what you're really doing here.

693
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,089
- What's that?
- You came to gloat.

694
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,922
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

695
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,178
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

696
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,261
- No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
- You got your son back.

697
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,108
You know...

698
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,900
Forget it.

699
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:30,111
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

700
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,288
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

701
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,252
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

702
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,755
- You thought Tommy was the one.
- Brendan, I was a drunk.

703
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,879
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

704
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:45,960
Forget it.

705
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:51,599
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

706
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,978
- But I was your son.
- You are my son, Brendan.

707
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,227
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

708
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,233
I'm just asking you if you can find...

709
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:11,403
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

710
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,743
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

711
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,792
- Okay.
- But I do not trust you.

712
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:27,502
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

713
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,843
- Okay. But they're not different things.
- All right?

714
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,844
You gotta trust to forgive.

715
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,925
Night, Pop.

716
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,135
My God.

717
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,223
Is that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

718
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,104
- Is that Rosie?
- Daddy, who is that?

719
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,527
It's just a nice, old man. Come on. Let's go.

720
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,526
How about a cup of coffee?

721
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,415
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

722
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,594
that Koba is coming to America
and will17ght at Sparta.

723
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,381
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

724
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,513
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

725
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,845
on US soil in his legendary career

726
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,148
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

727
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:27,444
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

728
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,863
Tommy,

729
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,316
I got some news for you.

730
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,446
I got you into Sparta.

731
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,364
It took some doing,

732
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,496
but I made it happen.

733
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,537
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

734
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,811
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

735
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,101
Tommy?

736
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,984
Okay. Sorry.

737
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,447
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

738
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,709
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

739
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,207
I was getting really worried about you.

740
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,632
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

741
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,960
Yeah, they're good.

742
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,008
- Maria's getting so big.
- Yeah?

743
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,803
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

744
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,309
- How's little man?
- He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

745
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,188
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

746
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,565
- He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
- Good.

747
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,487
- We're good.
- Good.

748
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,154
You know...

749
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:01,201
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

750
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,409
what I promised you.

751
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,876
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

752
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,423
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

753
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,092
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

754
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:17,547
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

755
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,178
- I wanna help you.
- You know what? You worry too much.

756
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,431
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

757
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,808
You know what? We're hanging in there.

758
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,768
”Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

759
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:34,071
”but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

760
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,400
”For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

761
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,828
”and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since. ”

762
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,790
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

763
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,957
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

764
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,586
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

765
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,712
And two, and three.

766
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,422
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

767
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,300
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

768
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,302
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

769
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,055
J. J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

770
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,138
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

771
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,149
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

772
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,444
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

773
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,271
But with this type of format,

774
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,989
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

775
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:23,037
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

776
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,829
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

777
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,873
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

778
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,544
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

779
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,334
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

780
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,168
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

781
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,837
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

782
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,968
- Come on!
- Nice.

783
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,967
Come on, baby!

784
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,554
With Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

785
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:52,642
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

786
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,647
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

787
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,479
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

788
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,361
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

789
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,409
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

790
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,111
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

791
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,906
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

792
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,538
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

793
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,994
Mission impossible, game over, go home.

794
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,750
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

795
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,503
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape

796
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,459
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

797
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,592
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

798
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,139
Two... Come on, Tommy.

799
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,433
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

800
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,348
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

801
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,597
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

802
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,183
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

803
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,232
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

804
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,033
on YouTube this year

805
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,453
Now joining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

806
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,620
Mad Dog Grimes.

807
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:51,576
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

808
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,750
and Tommy Riordan?

809
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,375
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

810
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,957
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

811
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,463
in Atlantic City.

812
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,803
Good. Always move. Always move.

813
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,303
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

814
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,512
Good! Good.

815
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,353
You see? You see? Beautiful.

816
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,682
Top of the food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

817
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,862
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

818
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,786
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

819
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:32,367
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

820
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,077
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer,

821
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,294
Frank Campana,

822
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,123
and top contender, Marco Santos.

823
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,629
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

824
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,585
The cage is your home.

825
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,091
You set the pace.

826
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,843
You set the rhythm.

827
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,932
Feel the Beethoven.

828
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,728
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

829
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,640
And when he does, that's your moment.

830
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,474
I see it. I see it. I see it.

831
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,899
No, he did not tap you!

832
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,740
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

833
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,155
You can do this, Son!

834
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,988
Smoother There's more in you!
You got more in you!

835
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,163
We're not done yet!

836
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,083
He's beating you! He's beating you!

837
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,128
You better push harden Marco!
Brendan's running away!

838
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,176
And the winner by tap out

839
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,095
”Irish” Brendan Conlon.

840
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:36,685
"...To each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self

841
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:41,769
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

842
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,401
”It cannot solve itself"

843
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,798
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

844
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,218
- You wanna grab a bite?
- No. I'm gonna head home.

845
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,046
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

846
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,800
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

847
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,060
Coach!

848
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,951
Hey, I know this is not a really great time,

849
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,200
and it's too bad about Marco.

850
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,625
But how about me?

851
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,244
Are you talking about Sparta?

852
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,918
Yeah.

853
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,590
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

854
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,666
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

855
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,558
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

856
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,392
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

857
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,977
Yeah.

858
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,821
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

859
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,733
That's what I'm afraid of.

860
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,319
Frank, I need this.

861
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,372
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

862
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,289
You're the guy. They trust you.

863
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,291
Brendan.

864
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,342
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

865
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,919
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

866
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,139
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

867
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,012
How does that benefit either one of us?

868
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,311
- It's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen?

869
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,354
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

870
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,645
It's not gonna happen.

871
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,574
I'll make a call.

872
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,717
I love my coach!

873
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,555
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

874
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,730
Yeah, he should.

875
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,355
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

876
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,483
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

877
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:36,197
Yeah, he's right here. it's your boyfriend.

878
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,867
Frank. Hey, man.

879
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,206
That's unbelievable.

880
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,298
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

881
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,057
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

882
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,936
All right. Bye.

883
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,810
I'm in.

884
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:13,189
- I'm going.
- Really?

885
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,818
That's your decision? You decided?

886
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,076
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

887
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,159
about making that decision together.

888
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:33,634
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

889
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,927
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

890
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,925
and he's the guy they're watching.

891
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:38,971
It's a lot of money, Tess.

892
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,550
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

893
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,803
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

894
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,354
before we pick up that prize money.

895
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,274
You don't think I can do it, right?

896
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,359
I think you could get killed.

897
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,445
- I'm not gonna get killed.
- You're not gonna get killed,

898
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,946
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

899
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,619
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

900
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,244
We have no prize money, we have no house.

901
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,371
- We have payments for hospital bills.
- Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

902
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,963
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

903
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,592
How's that for a promise?

904
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,473
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

905
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,803
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

906
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,320
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

907
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,818
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

908
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,181
Fourth of July weekend
doesn't officially get started until tomorrow,

909
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,733
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

910
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,654
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

911
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,528
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

912
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,029
we've got the red carpet!

913
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,612
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

914
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,539
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

915
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,329
You turned your back on Wall Street

916
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,752
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

917
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:36,081
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

918
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,294
Growing up, we all wanted to know

919
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,593
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

920
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,510
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

921
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,304
And that's why I put this thing together

922
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,179
That's what all these people are here to see,
come Saturday night.

923
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,601
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Thank you, J.J.

924
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:53,398
And here's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

925
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,898
The legend arriving to fight on US soil
for the very first time.

926
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:57,977
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

927
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,031
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

928
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,905
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

929
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:07,078
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

930
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,656
He is the greatest fighter...

931
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,465
I mean, you've seen our logos.

932
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,797
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

933
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,431
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

934
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,600
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

935
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,177
No, I'm not sure.

936
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,257
Hey, Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

937
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,054
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

938
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,256
- Frank Campana?
- Yeah.

939
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,057
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

940
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,931
- Julia, how are you?
- Brendan Conlon?

941
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,853
- Yeah, hi. Hey.
- Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

942
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,145
- Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

943
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,438
A few things I want to let you guys know.

944
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,438
- Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

945
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,690
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

946
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,066
Tommy!

947
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,281
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

948
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,275
Can we stand with J.J.?

949
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,945
”Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

950
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:33,999
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

951
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:38,328
”But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

952
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,166
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

953
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:46,378
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

954
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:50,091
”Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

955
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:54,098
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

956
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,646
”Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

957
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,474
"'I grow blind... "'

958
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,309
Now, the only person missing
from the event

959
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,895
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.

960
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:07,903
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

961
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,862
but a hero in the Iraq Wan
has cast an even wider spotlight

962
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,539
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

963
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,709
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

964
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,253
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

965
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:23,298
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

966
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,499
Tommy!

967
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,084
And the bridge just crumbled.

968
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,920
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

969
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:33,759
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

970
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,892
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

971
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,148
We were all drowning, man.

972
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,771
It was a death trap.

973
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,606
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

974
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,652
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off

975
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,405
There he was.

976
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,368
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

977
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,334
- He just vanished like a ghost.
- Tom my?

978
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,663
- Tommy, did you... Where you going?
- Taking a walk.

979
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,210
Tommy!

980
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,510
I really just wanted to say thank you.

981
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,797
You saved my life, brother

982
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:17,307
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

983
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:21,265
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

984
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,271
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

985
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,728
captured the heroic incident.

986
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,108
Hello?

987
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,689
Brendan?

988
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,199
Been looking all over for you.

989
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,787
How's it going?

990
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,580
It's going.

991
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,835
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

992
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,250
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

993
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:32,794
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

994
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,507
I'm good right here.

995
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,726
Okay.

996
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:50,278
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

997
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,730
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

998
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,074
You had the information.

999
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,280
You chose the old man and the girl.

1000
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,411
She wasn't just some girl.

1001
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,790
I married her.

1002
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,625
She's my wife.

1003
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,881
See?

1004
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,383
That's Tess.

1005
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,840
That's Emily and Rosie.

1006
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,051
They're your nieces, Tommy.

1007
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,761
I don't know them.

1008
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,690
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

1009
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,318
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1010
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,404
'Cause that's my family.

1011
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,400
And who are you exactly?

1012
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,831
I'm your brother, man.

1013
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,537
You were in the Corps?

1014
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,497
What?

1015
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,834
- I said I didn't Know you were in the Corps.
- I wasn't in the Corps.

1016
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,261
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1017
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,847
My brother was in the Corps.

1018
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,099
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1019
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,641
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1020
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,145
I don't know what you know.

1021
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,848
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1022
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,524
She's my wife, Tommy.

1023
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,895
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1024
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,356
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1025
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,360
God, man, I don't understand this.

1026
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,532
What? You...

1027
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:26,287
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1028
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:32,622
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1029
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,051
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1030
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,764
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1031
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,591
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1032
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,473
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1033
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,554
Everything I do is for them.

1034
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,103
I forgave Pop.

1035
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:53,025
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1036
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,901
You forgave us?

1037
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,117
Yeah.

1038
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,207
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1039
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,376
You got some stones, man.

1040
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,045
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1041
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,839
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1042
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,419
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1043
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,348
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1044
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,469
God.

1045
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:28,179
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1046
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,935
You leave, you get to bury people.

1047
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,937
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1048
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,154
I didn't even know she was sick.

1049
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,284
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1050
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,829
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1051
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,291
You know what?

1052
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,795
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1053
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,172
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1054
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,796
"I forgive Pop.

1055
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,052
"I forgive everyone."

1056
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,633
Brendan, you know,

1057
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,140
you're full of shit.

1058
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,937
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1059
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,467
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1060
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,670
while school's actually in session, right?

1061
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,676
- Yes, Principal Z.
- Tell him.

1062
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,053
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1063
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,100
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1064
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,849
What do you say?

1065
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,601
So, you want to use the auditorium

1066
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,309
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1067
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,643
- Right.
- Am I hearing this correct?

1068
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,603
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1069
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,529
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1070
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,653
You know,
I think you need to talk to your parents,

1071
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,860
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1072
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,365
- Everybody wants this.
- Come on, Mr. Zito.

1073
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,946
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1074
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,030
- Exactly.
- And the gym's the only place

1075
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,411
- that's big enough to fit everyone.
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

1076
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,994
- What if we get a petition signed?
- We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1077
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,954
- The power of democracy.
- What are they gonna do about that?

1078
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,004
Mr. Z, please?

1079
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,129
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1080
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,257
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1081
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,882
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1082
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:07,884
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1083
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:12,183
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1084
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,182
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for

1085
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:20,108
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1086
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,607
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1087
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,690
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1088
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,821
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair

1089
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:35,202
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1090
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,410
Sparta is here!

1091
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,502
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1092
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,331
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1093
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,505
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1094
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,461
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1095
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:52,469
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1096
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,764
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1097
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,266
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1098
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,770
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1099
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,647
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1100
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:08,072
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1101
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,570
who has become an overnight sensation

1102
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,651
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1103
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,499
Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1104
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,828
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career

1105
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,672
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1106
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,385
- Five minutes, Paddy.
- Okay.

1107
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:36,016
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1108
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,811
- because here comes Tommy Riordan.
- Wow!

1109
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,105
Tommy Riordan's
captured the media 's attention,

1110
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,148
but the question still remains.

1111
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,601
Who is this guy?

1112
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,151
And more importantly,

1113
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:49,151
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1114
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,982
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1115
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:54,786
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1116
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,033
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1117
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,990
this guy's a complete mystery.

1118
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,041
I can't find out anything about him.

1119
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,204
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1120
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,874
Get your hands off me.

1121
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,214
Okay, let's go.

1122
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,590
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1123
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,549
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1124
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,516
He skipped the press conference,

1125
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,969
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1126
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,804
He's breaking every rule.

1127
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:25,141
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1128
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:29,730
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1129
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,531
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1130
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,199
is because of another video.

1131
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,949
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1132
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,779
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1133
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,157
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1134
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,790
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1135
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,839
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1136
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,881
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1137
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,300
- Listen...
- He ripped the door off a tank.

1138
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,252
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1139
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,680
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1140
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:59,429
- but the tank don't hit back, you know.
- Sam...

1141
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,931
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1142
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,480
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1143
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,061
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1144
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,647
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1145
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,198
- Francisco Barbosa...
- He's nothing to scoff at.

1146
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,991
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1147
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,238
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1148
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,994
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1149
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,450
and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1150
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,534
It's a great story,

1151
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,667
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1152
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,209
- as a YouTube sensation.
- Well, well,

1153
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:33,418
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1154
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,677
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1155
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,300
I expect a clean fight.

1156
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,722
Obey my command at all times,

1157
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,094
defend yourselves at all times.

1158
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,971
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1159
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,601
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1160
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,148
just like we know. Just like we know.

1161
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,103
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1162
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,404
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1163
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,698
- Gentlemen, you ready?
- They are both game fighters.

1164
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,525
- And here we go.
- You ready?

1165
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,742
Let's go to war!

1166
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,410
Keep your focus, Tom.

1167
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,238
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1168
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,698
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1169
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,829
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1170
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,674
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1171
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,923
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1172
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:20,597
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1173
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,220
Hey, Tommy!

1174
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,393
There goes another rule, out the window!

1175
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,520
Where you going?

1176
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,645
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1177
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:32,397
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1178
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,312
- A huge left hook, launching...
- Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1179
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:38,275
- ...Tommy Riordan into the second round.
- One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1180
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,906
Good. Two, three.

1181
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,658
Good. Good, good, good.

1182
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,615
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
- Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1183
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,793
- Showtime.
- All right. Come on, give me eight.

1184
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,461
Yes! That's my boy.

1185
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,089
Let's go, move your head around.

1186
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,054
You ready?

1187
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,265
Look at me.

1188
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,857
You can do this.

1189
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,241
I wanna hear you say it.

1190
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,872
I can do this.

1191
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,371
Let's go do this.

1192
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,333
Yeah.

1193
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,671
Yeah.

1194
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:36,317
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1195
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,271
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1196
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,447
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1197
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,274
which is really something
I don't understand.

1198
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:45,325
I just... I'm shocked.

1199
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,453
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1200
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,829
Go. Good luck.

1201
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,586
Let's go, Brendan.

1202
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,300
You go get him, Son!

1203
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,470
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1204
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:08,095
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1205
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,972
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1206
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,019
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1207
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,228
Go get him, Son.

1208
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:19,901
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1209
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:23,026
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1210
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:27,360
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1211
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,868
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1212
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,576
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1213
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,377
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1214
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:38,879
- Come on.
- In fact, let me show you something.

1215
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:39,955
Right here. Let me tell you...

1216
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,460
- What?
- You see that, right there?

1217
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,386
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1218
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:49,341
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1219
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,675
He's a feeder fish.

1220
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,259
Come on, give the guy a break.

1221
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,686
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1222
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,230
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1223
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,274
- We remember him from that.
- I remember him, too.

1224
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,397
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1225
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,717
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1226
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,838
When the brackets were announced,

1227
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,761
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1228
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,806
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1229
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,975
Hey! You asked for it.

1230
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,353
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1231
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,022
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1232
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,021
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1233
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,774
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1234
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,198
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1235
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:51,948
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1236
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,995
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1237
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,701
- Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
- Gentlemen.

1238
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,704
Go get him.

1239
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,462
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1240
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:07,964
I expect a clean fight.

1241
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:11,547
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1242
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,803
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1243
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,136
Go have some fun, baby.

1244
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,642
Gentlemen, you ready?

1245
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,320
You ready? Let's go to war!

1246
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,656
Work your kicks!

1247
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,199
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1248
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,159
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1249
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,745
Let it out! Come on, move!

1250
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,633
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1251
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,127
In and out!

1252
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,010
Get off the fence!

1253
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,518
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1254
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:05,066
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1255
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,940
There he goes!

1256
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,363
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1257
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,277
Come on!

1258
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,237
Get up!

1259
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,863
- Come on! Come on!
- Watch the back of the head!

1260
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,118
- Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
- Midnight is all over Brendan.

1261
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,700
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1262
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,206
The teacher just has no answers.

1263
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,288
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1264
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,087
- And now, he's got the hooks in.
- The hooks are in.

1265
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,215
- Brendan in very big trouble.
- The end is close.

1266
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,213
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1267
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,135
Well, he's got the choke.

1268
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,807
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
- Come on.

1269
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,978
And Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1270
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,351
Get up! Find his legs!

1271
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,307
Hips! Hip down!

1272
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,768
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1273
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,319
Get your weight down!

1274
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,863
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1275
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,532
- Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
- Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1276
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,778
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1277
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,320
Hold on, Brendan.

1278
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,905
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1279
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,956
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1280
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,285
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1281
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,585
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1282
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,838
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1283
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,467
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1284
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:18,969
Jesus.

1285
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,391
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1286
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:28,351
You should've had him in the first round.

1287
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,605
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1288
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,531
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1289
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:36,279
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1290
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,739
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1291
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,163
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1292
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,953
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1293
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,785
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1294
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,963
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1295
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,085
and hear what he's saying in there.

1296
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:52,837
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1297
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,920
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1298
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,881
Let's go, seconds out!

1299
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,181
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1300
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,383
This round, knock him out.

1301
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,560
- Let's do it.
- He doesn't deserve to be here.

1302
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:05,603
Beautiful. Breathe.

1303
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:06,976
Let's go!

1304
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,694
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1305
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:13,861
Nice and easy!

1306
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,898
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1307
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,984
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1308
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,586
Circle around! Circle around!

1309
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,300
Nice and easy!

1310
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:41,841
Good, good!

1311
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,925
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1312
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:50,604
Get Out Of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1313
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,402
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1314
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:57,860
Do something.

1315
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:01,784
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1316
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,574
Shoot on him!

1317
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:07,415
Yes!

1318
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,585
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1319
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,161
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1320
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,213
- Scissors takedown.
- A beautiful scissors takedown.

1321
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,166
- Really nice.
- Conlon showing signs of life

1322
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,047
and not backing down.

1323
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,343
Knees, knees!

1324
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:23,970
Good!

1325
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,177
Take his arm! Good!

1326
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,139
- He's got a kimura lock!
- He's got a very good Kimura.

1327
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,567
Turn your hips in! In!

1328
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,612
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1329
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,490
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1330
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,862
Turn your hips in!

1331
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,578
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1332
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,822
Turn your hips up and in!

1333
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,998
Hips up! Very good!

1334
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,666
He's in a lot of trouble.

1335
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,585
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1336
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,631
- Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
- Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1337
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:56,797
Midnight is in big trouble.

1338
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:59,843
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1339
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,545
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1340
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,471
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1341
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,220
- and Midnight is in big trouble.
- Midnight...

1342
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:06,766
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1343
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,927
You got it! You got it!

1344
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,518
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1345
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:16,147
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1346
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,103
- This can't happen.
- It just did, Bryan.

1347
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,354
He tapped!

1348
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,489
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1349
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:24,034
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1350
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,828
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1351
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,160
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1352
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,794
Honey, he tapped him out!

1353
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:38,006
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1354
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,709
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1355
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,590
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1356
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,422
There's so many ways to lose.

1357
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,851
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1358
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,349
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1359
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:57,230
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1360
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,778
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1361
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:02,527
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1362
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,233
something all his fighters buy into,

1363
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,284
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1364
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,077
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1365
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:10,155
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1366
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,535
but, instead, he's going home.

1367
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:15,836
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1368
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,959
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1369
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,006
- I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
- I don't know.

1370
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,925
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1371
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,844
and waiting for his opportunity.

1372
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:29,091
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1373
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,719
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1374
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:56,831
Yes!

1375
01:30:58,703 --> 01:30:59,704
Okay.

1376
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,802
We 're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1377
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,684
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1378
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:23,311
- Right hand.
- Huge right hand.

1379
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:24,772
- Huge right hand.
- Oh, my goodness.

1380
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:27,199
Oh, my God! This is over.

1381
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,196
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1382
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:32,161
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1383
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:33,614
That's certainly possible.

1384
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,161
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1385
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:38,243
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1386
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:42,005
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1387
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,832
Like a man with something to prove,

1388
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,920
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.

1389
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:52,258
He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1390
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,014
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1391
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:57,516
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1392
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,097
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1393
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,729
Brendan! You can do it.

1394
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,318
Halfway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1395
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:11,447
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1396
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,449
He has been battered without mercy

1397
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:14,996
- in both of his fights today.
- Relax! You're okay!

1398
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:16,744
He's still standing, Bryan.

1399
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:19,910
Beethoven!

1400
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:21,586
No! No, no, no!

1401
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,873
Good, take him down!

1402
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,876
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1403
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,006
Hold on to him.

1404
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,721
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1405
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,639
- He's got an armbar.
- He's got that armbar.

1406
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,513
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1407
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,139
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1408
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:40,476
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1409
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,649
He's got that arm, Sam!

1410
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,230
- Break, break, break, break!
- Yes!

1411
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,357
Are you kidding me?

1412
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,234
Yes!

1413
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,691
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1414
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:54,074
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1415
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,745
I think I'm a believer.

1416
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,657
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1417
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,370
- I'm doing this!
- Okay.

1418
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:01,667
- I'm doing it!
- Okay.

1419
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:02,960
Okay, Son.

1420
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,624
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1421
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,918
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1422
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,629
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1423
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,430
He's just here to fight.

1424
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,975
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1425
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,518
Gentlemen, you ready?

1426
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,599
Are you ready?

1427
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,897
- Let's go to war!
- Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1428
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,105
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1429
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,944
- Yeah.
- He is all over Diego Santana.

1430
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,196
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1431
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,321
Oh, my goodness!

1432
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,000
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1433
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,927
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1434
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:56,677
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1435
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,384
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1436
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:28,296
- So where is he?
- Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1437
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,624
Make a right at that white sign...

1438
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:42,932
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1439
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:53,438
I know that that other thing is

1440
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,493
bothering the hell out of you.

1441
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:02,076
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1442
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:05,663
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1443
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:08,457
that was really something.

1444
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:13,709
How about deserting my unit?

1445
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,470
Is that really something, too?

1446
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,842
Yeah.

1447
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,639
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1448
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,270
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1449
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,475
No.

1450
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:36,064
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1451
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,284
I took off.

1452
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,040
That's why you go by Riordan.

1453
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:50,496
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1454
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,589
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1455
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:59,637
That is none of your business, man.

1456
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:02,556
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1457
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:05,101
I've done it, I've seen it.

1458
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,769
You can trust me. I understand.

1459
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,893
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1460
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,025
The suit don't fit.

1461
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:15,023
Tommy.

1462
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:17,985
I'm really trying here.

1463
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,572
- You're trying?
- Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1464
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:22,819
Now?

1465
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,832
Where were you when it mattered?

1466
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:32,879
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1467
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:37,046
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1468
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:41,137
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1469
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:44,762
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1470
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:48,141
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1471
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,096
is that the pair of us,

1472
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,983
we have absolutely no use for you.

1473
01:36:58,521 --> 01:36:59,898
Look at you.

1474
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,698
Yeah, I was right.

1475
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,496
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1476
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,699
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1477
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:12,957
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1478
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,966
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1479
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,088
Here's a cup.

1480
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,546
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1481
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,505
- Don't do this, Tommy.
- ...and you go back to the room

1482
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:26,262
- and you listen to some more...
- Don't do this.

1483
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:29,845
Fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1484
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,940
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1485
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:14,768
God pity them!

1486
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,851
All shall perish except me!

1487
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:25,404
Bastards. Bastards!

1488
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,655
You bastards. You bastards!

1489
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:33,245
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1490
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:35,668
Ishmael. God pity them.

1491
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:39,794
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1492
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,593
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1493
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:47,346
Ahab.

1494
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:50,516
You godless son of a bitch!

1495
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,468
You stop the ship!

1496
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:55,681
You godless son of a bitch!

1497
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:59,775
"'The whale! The ship! '
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1498
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,853
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward...

1499
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,153
Stop it.

1500
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,903
”'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1501
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:09,407
"%hab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'

1502
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,617
Captain...

1503
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,746
Stop the...

1504
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:18,123
Captain, stop...

1505
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,546
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1506
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,041
For the love of God.

1507
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:26,761
They're lost.

1508
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,718
Stop it... The ship.

1509
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:34,935
Ahab...

1510
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,724
You stop the...

1511
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:45,692
Oh, no.

1512
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,199
- Come on, give me the Walkman.
- No.

1513
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,497
- No, no.
- Come on.

1514
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:56,449
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1515
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:58,500
Come here, come here, come here.

1516
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,920
- Come on. Give me.
- No.

1517
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,557
Tommy.

1518
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,267
We're lost.

1519
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,763
We're lost, Tommy.

1520
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,560
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1521
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:28,155
- Stay down.
- We'll never make it back.

1522
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,327
I'm here.

1523
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:47,796
I always loved you.

1524
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:52,339
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1525
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,928
I always loved you.

1526
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,846
You and your brother. My two boys.

1527
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:18,661
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1528
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:35,806
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1529
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:43,022
Once again, no walk-out music.

1530
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,686
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1531
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,744
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1532
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,821
I've never seen anything like this.

1533
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:18,807
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1534
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:21,056
and climbing into the cage.

1535
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,976
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1536
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,778
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1537
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,696
and turned his life upside down.

1538
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:36,493
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1539
01:42:38,027 --> 01:42:42,498
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1540
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,873
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1541
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:50,923
All right, gentlemen.

1542
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:57,133
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1543
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:58,510
I expect a clean fight.

1544
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:01,513
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1545
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,469
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1546
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:05,429
It's not gonna happen again.

1547
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:10,561
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1548
01:43:10,643 --> 01:43:12,065
He predicted an early knockout.

1549
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:14,863
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1550
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:17,488
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1551
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:20,445
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1552
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:23,448
Gentlemen, you ready?

1553
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,290
You ready?

1554
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:29,420
- Let's go to war!
- Here they go and they are off!

1555
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:33,378
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1556
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,130
He's raining bombs!

1557
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:37,632
- Cover up!
- Come on, work it.

1558
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,340
- Raining bombs.
- Mad Dog is out.

1559
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:42,551
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1560
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,135
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1561
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:48,185
Break! Break! Break!

1562
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,731
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1563
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:56,280
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1564
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,786
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1565
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,454
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1566
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:06,282
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1567
01:44:06,365 --> 01:44:09,539
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1568
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,170
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
- Sparta!

1569
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,103
Yeah!

1570
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,602
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1571
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,107
I'm on your side.

1572
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,698
Let's go.

1573
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:49,833
- Principal Zito, there he is.
- Nice.

1574
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:55,544
Let's go, Brendan.

1575
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:02,506
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1576
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:04,807
and now here he is in the final four.

1577
01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:08,477
The crowd snowing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1578
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:12,477
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1579
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:15,692
Come on, come on. You all right?

1580
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:19,946
You've got a visitor.

1581
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,117
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1582
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:33,828
You all right with that?

1583
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:39,796
I love you.

1584
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:45,473
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1585
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,269
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1586
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,597
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1587
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,363
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1588
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:04,157
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1589
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,683
I'm proud of you, brother.

1590
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:36,023
This is your cage.

1591
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,240
Gentlemen.

1592
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,708
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1593
01:46:58,787 --> 01:47:00,255
I expect a clean fight.

1594
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,084
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1595
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:05,716
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1596
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:12,264
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1597
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,516
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1598
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:17,690
- Well, here we go.
- He's like a machine. Look at him.

1599
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,024
Gentlemen, you ready?

1600
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:24,237
You ready? Let's go to war!

1601
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:25,815
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1602
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:29,823
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1603
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,199
Angle out of it!

1604
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,699
Keep moving!

1605
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,786
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1606
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,293
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1607
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:47,094
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1608
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:51,219
- Crushing body shots.
- Relax, you're okay.

1609
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,221
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1610
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,677
Get up! Get up!

1611
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,728
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1612
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:58,348
Go, go, go. Get up!

1613
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,353
He's getting his ass whooped.

1614
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:04,653
And now he's got him in the air!

1615
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,401
Oh, God.

1616
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,733
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1617
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:14,747
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1618
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:17,166
- How much abuse can one man take?
- ...continuing another round of this.

1619
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:18,367
Go to war!

1620
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:25,921
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1621
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,255
Brendan's going for a ride!

1622
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:32,931
That one shook the entire building!

1623
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:36,969
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1624
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:40,852
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1625
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,649
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1626
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,695
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1627
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,692
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1628
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:50,445
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1629
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:53,619
- His forearms and his hands.
- Drop that neck!

1630
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:55,196
How much can one man take?

1631
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:57,581
Break! Break! Break!

1632
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,086
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1633
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,914
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1634
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:06,965
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1635
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:09,214
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1636
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:11,091
- He's lasted two rounds with Koba
- That's true, that's true.

1637
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,298
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1638
01:49:14,423 --> 01:49:16,346
Sit down. Sit down.

1639
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:19,095
Breathe. Breathe!

1640
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,931
Look at me. Look at me!

1641
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:25,314
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1642
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:30,731
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1643
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:32,282
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1644
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:33,609
Are we here to win this fight?

1645
01:49:33,692 --> 01:49:36,366
You tell me.
'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.

1646
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,413
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1647
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:40,491
We'll go home, okay?

1648
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:43,494
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1649
01:49:43,744 --> 01:49:45,542
Do you understand me?

1650
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,379
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1651
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,835
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1652
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:13,365
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1653
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:21,078
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1654
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:23,579
And Koba's all over him once again.

1655
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:27,879
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1656
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:29,798
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1657
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:32,213
He's starting to mix it up.

1658
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:41,719
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1659
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:46,891
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1660
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:49,481
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1661
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,313
- Yes!
- Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1662
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:54,273
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1663
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,324
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1664
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,401
trying to choke the teacher out.

1665
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:00,328
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1666
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:02,406
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1667
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:04,996
Conlon looking for a way out.

1668
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:07,919
- What is this?
- Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1669
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:10,669
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1670
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:12,966
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1671
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,590
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
- Hips, hips, hips!

1672
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:17,046
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1673
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,469
Koba slips right out.

1674
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:22,931
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1675
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,730
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1676
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:28,933
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1677
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:30,017
- but Koba's on his feet.
- Get up, get up!

1678
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,602
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1679
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,687
and his endless bag of submissions.

1680
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:37,195
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1681
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:40,198
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1682
01:51:40,277 --> 01:51:42,530
We have got ourselves a fight!

1683
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:48,536
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1684
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:50,872
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1685
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,956
He's got it very, very deep!

1686
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,382
He's deep on that.

1687
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,547
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1688
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,425
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1689
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:00,221
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1690
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,096
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1691
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,222
Not letting out!

1692
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:07,396
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1693
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,223
He's putting everything he has into it.

1694
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,068
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1695
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:14,144
Koba taps.

1696
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:16,651
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1697
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:20,530
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1698
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:23,203
He's tapped Koba!

1699
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:26,031
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1700
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:28,663
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1701
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,962
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1702
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:36,171
- Tess!
- You got it! You did it!

1703
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,550
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1704
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:41,255
- Babe, you did it!
- Brendan Conlon!

1705
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:44,091
- I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
- I don't know what I just saw.

1706
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:46,347
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1707
01:52:46,426 --> 01:52:49,270
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1708
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,440
I have never seen anything like this.

1709
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:54,985
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1710
01:52:56,812 --> 01:53:00,112
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1711
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:04,036
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1712
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:06,284
He's done the impossible.

1713
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:09,833
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1714
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:14,046
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1715
01:53:25,841 --> 01:53:28,344
This is CNN Breaking News.

1716
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:32,807
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1717
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:36,394
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1718
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:39,320
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1719
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:42,275
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year,

1720
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:45,236
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1721
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:46,696
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1722
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:49,908
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1723
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:52,618
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1724
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:55,211
The bombs started dropping.

1725
01:53:55,954 --> 01:53:58,833
They were coming from US planes.

1726
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:02,761
Tommy and Manny were waving their Hags

1727
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:06,181
to let them know they were Americans,

1728
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:07,883
but they didn't stop.

1729
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:10,928
Everyone died.

1730
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:13,559
Everyone except Tommy.

1731
01:54:14,389 --> 01:54:17,859
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1732
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:23,107
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1733
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:27,745
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1734
01:54:27,819 --> 01:54:31,198
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1735
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:34,410
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1736
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:38,873
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1737
01:54:38,955 --> 01:54:40,832
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1738
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:44,544
We've just got some incredible news,

1739
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:47,302
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1740
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:51,556
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1741
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:53,808
for the $5 million prize,

1742
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:57,399
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1743
01:54:57,474 --> 01:54:58,976
are brothers.

1744
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:27,421
All right, let's get this off.

1745
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:46,523
What are you gonna do?

1746
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:53,155
I'm gonna fight him.

1747
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:07,445
- Mr. C, Mr. C!
- Mr. C, Mr. C!

1748
01:57:53,191 --> 01:57:56,365
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1749
01:58:54,711 --> 01:58:56,054
Gentlemen.

1750
01:59:02,886 --> 01:59:05,309
Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1751
01:59:05,388 --> 01:59:08,483
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1752
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,356
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1753
01:59:10,435 --> 01:59:11,857
Where's Pop?

1754
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:34,250
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1755
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:36,924
Are you ready?

1756
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:39,426
Let's go to war!

1757
01:59:51,476 --> 01:59:53,444
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1758
01:59:57,482 --> 01:59:59,109
Get out! Get out of there!

1759
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,283
Throw your hands!

1760
02:00:03,571 --> 02:00:05,539
Throw your hands!

1761
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,709
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1762
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,286
Move! Move!

1763
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:14,628
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1764
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,510
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1765
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:20,968
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1766
02:00:26,803 --> 02:00:28,976
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1767
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:30,978
Relax! Breathe!

1768
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:34,231
Tie him up! Get up!
Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

1769
02:00:34,936 --> 02:00:36,313
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

1770
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:38,656
Break!

1771
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:40,150
What was that?

1772
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:41,655
Hey, come on, Josh!

1773
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:42,993
What's up with that?

1774
02:00:43,319 --> 02:00:45,071
Hey, step back!

1775
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:46,702
Watch that late blow!

1776
02:00:47,407 --> 02:00:48,659
Come on!

1777
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,756
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1778
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:01,008
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1779
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:02,885
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1780
02:01:02,964 --> 02:01:05,058
Look at me. Sit down.

1781
02:01:05,675 --> 02:01:07,848
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1782
02:01:09,053 --> 02:01:13,433
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1783
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:16,065
Breathe. Beethoven.

1784
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:20,065
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1785
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,277
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1786
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:24,656
- Angle out and move.
- Good.

1787
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,205
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1788
02:01:29,282 --> 02:01:32,126
- Okay. He's not your brother, right?
- Time's up!

1789
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:34,045
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1790
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,212
- All right.
- He's in the way.

1791
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:37,674
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1792
02:01:37,749 --> 02:01:40,172
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

1793
02:01:42,712 --> 02:01:44,555
Do your job, Josh.

1794
02:01:49,677 --> 02:01:51,054
Come on, babe. Come on.

1795
02:01:51,221 --> 02:01:52,814
Let's go to war.

1796
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:53,890
Breathe!

1797
02:01:59,062 --> 02:02:01,281
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1798
02:02:11,574 --> 02:02:12,575
Cover up!

1799
02:02:13,493 --> 02:02:15,837
Come on, get off the fence!

1800
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:17,084
Get off the fence!

1801
02:02:17,914 --> 02:02:19,131
Hands up! Hands up!

1802
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:23,507
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1803
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:26,597
Yeah!

1804
02:02:33,096 --> 02:02:34,097
Get him!

1805
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:40,149
- Huge throw. Huge.
- Look at that.

1806
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:41,855
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1807
02:02:41,938 --> 02:02:43,611
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1808
02:02:46,734 --> 02:02:48,862
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1809
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:51,827
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1810
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,749
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1811
02:02:58,454 --> 02:02:59,956
Break free! Break! Break!

1812
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:04,587
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1813
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:06,296
- Come on.
- Here we go, mom.

1814
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:09,929
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1815
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:16,981
Let's go to war!

1816
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:36,872
Now! Get up! Get up!

1817
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:39,416
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1818
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:41,338
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1819
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:42,961
Switch! Switch!

1820
02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:46,427
Hips!

1821
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:48,713
Down, down. Hips down.

1822
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,762
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1823
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,853
Come on, Tommy!

1824
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,943
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1825
02:04:06,689 --> 02:04:07,815
Tom!

1826
02:04:15,323 --> 02:04:16,575
Break! Break! Break!

1827
02:04:16,658 --> 02:04:19,207
Tommy, you okay?

1828
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:26,209
- Tommy!
- Go! Let's go! Go!

1829
02:04:26,292 --> 02:04:27,714
Calm down. Calm down.

1830
02:04:28,753 --> 02:04:31,302
- It's the championship. Keep it together.
- All right. All right. I got it.

1831
02:04:31,381 --> 02:04:32,883
Sit down. Sit down!

1832
02:04:40,348 --> 02:04:42,146
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1833
02:04:42,225 --> 02:04:45,445
- I popped his shoulder.
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1834
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,147
- I heard it tear.
- You popped his shoulder?

1835
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:48,277
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

1836
02:04:48,356 --> 02:04:50,984
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1837
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,944
- Josh.
- Hey, hey, no Josh.

1838
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,153
- Josh.
- Hey!

1839
02:04:54,237 --> 02:04:55,659
- Look at me. Look at me.
- What?

1840
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:57,536
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1841
02:04:57,615 --> 02:04:58,912
We need both rounds.

1842
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:02,753
What?

1843
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:05,924
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1844
02:05:12,463 --> 02:05:15,592
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1845
02:05:23,182 --> 02:05:25,560
Tommy, what are you doing?

1846
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:27,937
Shut up. Come on.

1847
02:05:28,896 --> 02:05:30,364
Stand back.

1848
02:05:31,107 --> 02:05:34,236
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1849
02:05:35,737 --> 02:05:37,410
Let's go to war!

1850
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:41,125
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1851
02:05:41,826 --> 02:05:43,078
It's over.

1852
02:05:44,287 --> 02:05:46,961
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1853
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:50,131
It's over, Tommy.

1854
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:51,377
You better fight!

1855
02:06:02,305 --> 02:06:04,399
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1856
02:06:08,519 --> 02:06:10,897
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1857
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:25,294
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1858
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:26,963
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1859
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:36,882
Okay? You all right there?

1860
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:39,016
Tommy!

1861
02:06:49,435 --> 02:06:51,938
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1862
02:06:58,611 --> 02:06:59,988
Come on.

1863
02:07:10,748 --> 02:07:13,718
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

1864
02:09:11,244 --> 02:09:14,839
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1865
02:09:18,042 --> 02:09:20,010
Tap, Tommy.

1866
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:23,139
It's okay. It's okay.

1867
02:09:33,099 --> 02:09:34,646
I love you.

1868
02:09:35,851 --> 02:09:37,353
I love you, Tommy.
