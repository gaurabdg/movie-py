1
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,791
Open it.

2
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,949
Don't.

3
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,204
We've got to see if
there's anything...

4
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,706
I know.

5
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,042
But not just yet.

6
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,628
Let's stay this way
for a minute.

7
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,612
Phillip, we don't have
too much time.

8
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,741
It's the darkness
that's got you down.

9
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,951
Nobody ever feels
really safe in the dark.

10
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,745
Nobody who was ever
a child, that is.

11
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,997
I'll open these,
all right?

12
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,837
There, that's much better.

13
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,929
What a lovely evening.

14
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,727
Pity we couldn't
have done it with

15
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,022
the curtains open
in the bright sunlight.

16
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:41,197
Well... Can't have
everything, can we?

17
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:46,118
We did do it in daytime.
All right now, Phillip?

18
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,120
Yes.
Good. You better
put those away.

19
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,707
Put them in
my checkbook drawer,
behind that metal box.

20
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:14,480
Now... This is
a museum piece now.

21
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,441
We really should
preserve it for posterity,

22
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,737
except it's such good
crystal, and I'd hate
to break up the set.

23
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,536
Out of this,
David Kentley had
his last drink.

24
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,667
It should have been
ginger ale or even beer.

25
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,669
I've always thought
it was out of character

26
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,505
for David to drink anything
as corrupt as whiskey.

27
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,508
Out of character for
him to be murdered, too.

28
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,094
Yes, wasn't it?
But good Americans usually

29
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,805
die young on
the battlefield,
don't they?

30
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,643
Well, the Davids
of this world
merely occupy space,

31
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,939
which is why he was
the perfect victim
for the perfect murder.

32
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:02,445
Course, he was
a Harvard undergraduate.

33
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,031
That might
make it justifiable homicide.

34
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,200
He's dead
and we've killed him.
But he's still here.

35
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,411
In less than eight hours,
he'll be resting

36
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,538
gently but firmly at
the bottom of a lake.

37
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,457
Meanwhile, he's here.

38
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,044
What are you doing?

39
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,545
It's not locked.

40
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,380
All the better.
It's much more dangerous.

41
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,966
Anyway,
the lock's too old,
it won't work.

42
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,219
I wish it would.
I wish we had him
out of here.

43
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,638
I wish it were
somebody else.

44
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,392
It's a trifle late for that,
don't you think?

45
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,312
Whom would you have
preferred? Kenneth?

46
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:41,567
Oh, I don't know. I suppose
anyone was as good
or as bad as any other.

47
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,822
You, perhaps.
You frighten me.

48
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,910
You always have,
from that very first
day in prep school.

49
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,913
Part of your charm,
I suppose.

50
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm only kidding, Brandon.

51
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,213
I obviously can't
take it as well as you,

52
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,715
so I'm turning on you
a little.

53
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,051
That's rather foolish,
isn't it?

54
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,178
Yes, very.

55
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,058
May I have a drink now?

56
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,395
By all means.
This is an occasion.
It calls for champagne.

57
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,730
Champagne?

58
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,190
I put some in the icebox.

59
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,775
When did you put
it there, Brandon?

60
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,777
Just before David arrived.

61
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,445
You were certain
it would come off,
weren't you?

62
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,655
Of course.

63
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,450
You know I'd never
do anything unless
I did it perfectly.

64
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,370
I've always wished for
more artistic talent.

65
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,997
Well, murder
can be an art, too.

66
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,126
The power to kill
can be just as satisfying

67
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,544
as the power to create.

68
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,259
Phillip, do you realize
we've actually done it,
exactly as we planned?

69
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,178
And not a single
infinitesimal thing
has gone wrong.

70
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,263
It was perfect.

71
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,472
Yes.

72
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,141
An immaculate murder.

73
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,936
We've killed for
the sake of danger and
for the sake of killing.

74
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,606
We're alive, truly
and wonderfully alive.

75
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,401
Even champagne
isn't equal to us,
or the occasion.

76
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,694
I'll take it, though.

77
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,113
You're not really
frightened anymore,
are you, Phillip?

78
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,949
You can't have fear,
you know?
Neither of us can.

79
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,201
That's the difference
between us and
the ordinary men, Phillip.

80
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,037
They talk about
committing the perfect crime,
but nobody does it.

81
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,039
Nobody commits
a murder just for the...
Here.

82
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,876
...experiment
of committing it.

83
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,086
Nobody except us.

84
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,214
You're not frightened
anymore, are you,
Phillip?

85
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,382
No.

86
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,342
Not even of me?

87
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,678
No.

88
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,929
That's good.

89
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,351
You just astound me,
as always.

90
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,228
That's even better.

91
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,815
To David, of course.

92
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,326
Brandon, how did you feel?

93
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,577
When?

94
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,245
During it.

95
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,668
I don't know, really.
I don't remember feeling
very much of anything.

96
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,174
Until his body went limp,

97
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,510
and I knew it was over.

98
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,595
And then?

99
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,475
Then I felt
tremendously exhilarated.

100
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,311
How did you feel?

101
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,023
I...

102
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,361
Brandon, you don't
think the party's
a mistake, do you?

103
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,739
No, the party's
the inspired finishing
touch to our work.

104
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,742
It's more,
it's the signature
of the artist.

105
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,161
Not having it
would be like...

106
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,997
Painting a picture
and not hanging it?

107
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,124
I don't think that's a very
good choice of words.

108
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,669
It may turn out to be
a little too choice,
thanks to the party.

109
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,339
Oh, rot. This party
will be the most
exciting ever given.

110
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,507
With these people?

111
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,633
They're a dull crew,
all right.

112
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,135
The Kentleys
couldn't be duller
if they tried,

113
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,596
but we did have
to have them.

114
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,433
After all, they are
David's mother and father.

115
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,978
That doesn't make them
any easier to talk to.

116
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,273
Don't worry.
Janet'll be buttering
them up, poor girl.

117
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,276
She's banked everything
on hooking David.

118
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,029
Somehow, I don't think
she's going to succeed.

119
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,115
Do you?

120
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,701
No, somehow, I don't.

121
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,453
Well, she can switch back
to Kenneth tonight.

122
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,747
You must admit,
it was most
considerate of me,

123
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,792
in view of
recent events, to...

124
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,509
Phillip.
What?

125
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,635
Take the other one.

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,761
What for?

127
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,055
Never mind. Come with me.

128
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,683
What's this all about?

129
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,977
You'll see. It's brilliant!

130
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,863
What the devil
are you doing?

131
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,033
Making our work of art
a masterpiece.

132
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,451
Brandon, you're
going too far.

133
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,453
Why? What do you mean?

134
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,915
I just thought
it'd be nice to
have supper in here.

135
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,543
On this.

136
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,213
Isn't it a good idea?

137
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,302
Well, at least this way,
no one will try to open it.

138
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,347
I don't think you
appreciate me, Phillip.

139
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,223
I'm beginning to, Brandon.

140
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,225
Well, come on,
we don't have
too much time.

141
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,227
Mrs. Wilson will
be coming back soon.

142
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,979
Did you forget
to borrow her key?

143
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,272
I might've known
better than to...

144
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,275
I didn't forget.
I have her key.
I told her I lost mine.

145
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,526
Oh, good.

146
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,778
How are you going to
explain this to her?

147
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,029
I'm not.

148
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,405
We've got to
have some excuse.

149
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,785
We don't want to leave
our guest of honor
alone during supper.

150
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,204
Brandon, we've got
to have an excuse
for the others.

151
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,998
All right, all right.
Let me think.

152
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,255
Really, you get
much too upset
much too easily, Phillip.

153
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,842
We have
a very simple excuse

154
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,303
right here.

155
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,516
What are you
worrying about, Phillip?

156
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,727
After all, old Mr. Kentley's
coming mainly to
look at these books.

157
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,229
Now what could be
better than to have them

158
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,814
laid out neatly on
the dining room table

159
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
where the poor, old man
can easily get at them?

160
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,402
Considerate, aren't we?
Most...

161
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,495
Hello? Oh. Of course.

162
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,914
You start on the books...

163
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,957
Who is it?

164
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,708
Mrs. Wilson.

165
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,438
Brandon.

166
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,816
Brandon!

167
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,155
What the devil?
Don't you have any
more sense than to...

168
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,282
What is it?

169
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,825
Well, go on, yank it out.

170
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,368
I can't.

171
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,121
If Mrs. Wilson were here,
she'd yank it out for you.

172
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,081
A stupid display like that
in front of somebody else

173
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,333
will be just as
good as a confession.

174
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,003
Now, take these
and get a hold of yourself.

175
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,963
If you'd let me keep
the light on before
as I'd wanted,

176
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,466
I would have seen it.
All right! You're perfect.

177
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,176
We have to be, Phillip.

178
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,137
We agreed there was
only one crime either
of us could commit.

179
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,974
The crime of
making a mistake.
Being weak is a mistake.

180
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,018
Because it's being human?

181
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,352
Because it's being ordinary.

182
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,938
I won't let
either of us stoop...

183
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,035
You owe me $2.40 for taxis,
including the tip.

184
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,329
If it weren't for
the traffic, I'd have
been here a half hour ago.

185
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh, it's just as well.
We didn't expect
you back until now.

186
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,001
Well,
I went to five stores for
the special pâté we like.

187
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,503
But the prices!

188
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,505
I couldn't see any reason
for throwing away
our good money.

189
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,006
So I went downtown

190
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,134
to that little delicatessen
where Mr. Cadell goes.

191
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,346
But I tell you, the next
time we give a party,
I'm only going...

192
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,515
Good evening, Mrs. Wilson.

193
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,979
What, may I ask,
is happening to my table?

194
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,815
We're just moving
the things in here.

195
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,943
Well...

196
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,322
I personally thought
my table was quite lovely.

197
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,698
Oh, it was quite lovely.

198
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,201
But you see,
Mr. Kentley's coming

199
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,703
to look at these old books
I had in the chest.

200
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,582
And I'm sure
you wouldn't want
the poor, old man

201
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,751
to have to get
down on his knees
to see them.

202
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,211
Well, I think
it looks
downright peculiar.

203
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,629
Peculiar?

204
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,756
Very. Particularly
those candlesticks.

205
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,174
They don't
belong there at all.

206
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:48,804
On the contrary,
I think they suggest
a ceremonial altar,

207
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,683
which you can heap
with the foods for
our sacrificial feast.

208
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,851
Heap is right.
Certainly isn't
enough room

209
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,186
for me to set
things out properly.

210
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,188
Is there, Mr. Phillip?
Oh, you can make it do.

211
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,439
You two will be the death of me.

212
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,691
What's to be done
with the books?

213
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,734
We'll lay them out on
the dining room table.

214
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,736
A crazy idea,
if you ask me.

215
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,114
Well, I have too much
to do to discuss this
thoroughly, dear.

216
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,117
However, I still
think it's peculiar.

217
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,285
What on Earth's the matter?

218
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,411
I was sure she'd notice.

219
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,537
Notice what?

220
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,580
The rope, of course.

221
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,747
Brandon, we've
got to hide it.

222
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,832
Why?

223
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
Why?
Yes, why?

224
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,960
It's only
a piece of rope, Phillip.

225
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,589
An ordinary household
article. Why hide it?

226
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,258
It belongs in
the kitchen drawer.

227
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,862
Uh, Mrs. Wilson?
Yes?

228
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,572
There's champagne
in the icebox.

229
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,324
Oh, we're not giving
them champagne?

230
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,491
We are.

231
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,495
Oh, well, it's going to
be that kind of party.
I'd better doll up a little.

232
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,957
We only serve champagne
at Mr. Cadell's
on very high occasions.

233
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,459
Matter of fact,
he and I once had

234
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,836
a glass together
on my birthday.

235
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,087
Tonight, Mrs. Wilson,

236
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,673
you'll have an opportunity
to renew that romance.

237
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,302
May I?
Mr. Cadell's coming.

238
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,930
Oh, my. Oh, Mr. Cadell's
terribly nice.

239
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:14,973
Rupert's coming?

240
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,058
Yes, I thought I told you.

241
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,434
Oh, I must say
I did enjoy working
for Mr. Cadell.

242
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,810
No, you didn't.

243
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,312
Such a gentleman!

244
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,524
Of course some people say
he's a little peculiar,
but I always...

245
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,278
Well, you might
let me finish.

246
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,448
I thought
you liked Rupert.

247
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,532
I do.

248
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,867
Well, then.

249
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,452
Brandon, of all
the people on this Earth,

250
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,829
Rupert Cadell is
the one man most
likely to suspect.

251
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,082
He's the one man
who might appreciate this
from our angle,

252
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,208
the artistic one.

253
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,334
That's what's exciting.

254
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,919
I'm glad it excites you.
It frightens me.

255
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,797
I know...
I suggest you keep
your voice down.

256
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,550
It would have been too
easy with the others,
Phillip, and too dull.

257
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,971
As for Rupert,
I once thought of
inviting him to join us.

258
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,515
Why didn't you?
The more the merrier.

259
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,016
Because he hasn't the nerve.

260
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,519
Oh, intellectually,
he could've come along.
He's brilliant.

261
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,521
But he's
a little too fastidious.

262
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,189
He could've invented
and he could've admired,

263
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,691
but he never
could have acted.

264
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,067
That's where
we're superior, Phillip.

265
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,735
We have courage,
Rupert doesn't.

266
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,655
Mr. Cadell got
a bad leg in the war
for his courage.

267
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,907
And you've got your sleeve
in the celery, Mr. Phillip.

268
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,494
Oh, they're here.
Are we ready?

269
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,704
As ready as we'll ever be.

270
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,871
Now mind you.

271
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,665
Don't you be so busy
at that piano

272
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,792
that you don't eat anything,
getting too thin.

273
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,669
And don't you
let them gobble up
all that pâté

274
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,920
before you have any.

275
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,340
Let's hope it's a success.
Oh, mind my tray.

276
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,384
Take it in the kitchen,
Mrs. Wilson.
I'll answer the door.

277
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,219
There wouldn't be
this last minute
hustle-bustle

278
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,303
if you'd kept my table

279
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,722
and let those old books...

280
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,849
Now the fun begins.

281
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,147
Hello, come in.

282
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,231
How are you, Brandon?

283
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,566
Fine. Just put
your hat there.

284
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,775
Thank you.

285
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,360
It's been quite a while,
hasn't it?

286
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,696
Yes, that's why I sounded
so stupid on the phone.

287
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,990
Surprised, I guess.

288
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,743
Hello, Kenneth.
Good to see you.

289
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,910
You, too.

290
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,579
Been up to much lately?

291
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,330
Nothing to speak of.
You?

292
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,499
Oh, just trying to
get ready for exams.

293
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,335
I always have
to start cramming
before everybody else.

294
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,628
Am I the first?

295
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,921
You are.

296
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,965
Why is it I'm always
too early at parties?

297
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,967
Probably because
you're always on time.

298
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,720
Uh, Mrs. Wilson, champagne.

299
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,929
Oh...

300
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,349
It isn't someone's
birthday, is it?

301
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,768
Don't look so worried,
Kenneth.

302
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,103
It's really
almost the opposite.

303
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,229
The opposite?

304
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,607
Phillip's bidding
the world a temporary
farewell tonight.

305
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,442
I'm driving him
up to Connecticut
after the party.

306
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,902
Oh. Where are you going?

307
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,446
Just to
Brandon's mother's place
for a few weeks.

308
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,614
I'm to be locked up.

309
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,782
What?

310
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,284
To make sure
he practices
six hours a day.

311
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,703
I've finally
wangled a debut for him.

312
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,455
Town Hall, at that.
That's wonderful.

313
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,123
I hope you knock 'em dead.

314
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,500
Thank you.

315
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,669
Mmm! Most decorative.

316
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,296
Think so?

317
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,216
Hey.

318
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,383
What is it?

319
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,802
I feel pretty honored.

320
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,220
Oh? Why?

321
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,388
Looks like a pretty
small farewell party.

322
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,475
Oh, well, we're really
killing two birds
with one stone.

323
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,976
The party's also
for Mr. Kentley.

324
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,394
David's father?

325
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,646
Yes.

326
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,147
Oh...

327
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,399
Is David going
to be here?

328
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,652
Of course.

329
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,820
Who else is coming?

330
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,822
Oh, no one you don't
know, if that's
what's bothering you.

331
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,740
The Kentleys,
Janet Walker...

332
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,492
Janet?

333
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,246
Yes. I thought you'd
be glad to see her.

334
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,164
Won't you be?

335
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,126
Brandon, Janet and I
are all washed up.
Didn't you know?

336
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,671
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't.

337
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,631
Well, you knew, Phillip.

338
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,177
Oh, I heard vague rumors,
but I never pay attention
to that sort of thing.

339
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,303
I wish you had.

340
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,429
Why?

341
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,683
Well, Janet and David are...

342
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,643
Hello, Mrs. Wilson.

343
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,270
May I?
Help yourself.

344
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,480
And cheer up.
I have the oddest
feeling, anyway,

345
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,857
that your chances
with the young lady

346
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,191
are much better
than you think.

347
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,359
What do you mean?

348
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,443
Janet!

349
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,990
Hello, ducks. Angel!

350
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,785
Be careful of my hair,
it took hours.
You smell dreamy.

351
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,161
What is it?

352
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,872
That swill you gave me
last Christmas.

353
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,582
I always knew
I had good taste.

354
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,292
You do. You look lovely.

355
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,961
I won't by the time
it's all paid for.

356
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,714
Was that funny?
I never know when
I'm being funny.

357
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,758
Whenever I try to be,
I lay the bomb of all time.

358
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,885
Phillip, sweet.

359
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,969
Hello.

360
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,222
What's this rumor I hear
about you and Town Hall?

361
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,393
I bet you're going to
play a foul trick on
all of us and become...

362
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,811
...horribly famous.

363
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,438
I believe you've met.

364
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,733
Hello, Ken.

365
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,817
Hello, Jan.

366
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,780
Well, that was fascinating,
wasn't it?
I seem to have run down.

367
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,825
What would you say
to some champagne?

368
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,077
"Hello, champagne."

369
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,331
You see what I mean
about trying to be funny?

370
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,124
How've you been, Ken?
Fine, thanks.

371
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,043
How's the new job?
What are you doing?

372
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,920
Writing that
same dreary column

373
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,088
on how to keep
the body beautiful.

374
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,590
For whom this time?

375
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,635
Oh, an untidy little
magazine known as Allure.

376
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,219
Thanks, chum.

377
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,517
Oh, isn't that painting new?

378
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,019
Yes, it is.
Do you like it?

379
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,646
Well, what is it?

380
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,564
A new, young,
American primitive.

381
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,483
I have a new, young,
American sister.

382
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,361
She's only three
and her stuff is
really primitive.

383
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,112
You dirty dog.

384
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,822
Why?

385
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,159
Didn't I notice
another new one in
the foyer when I came in?

386
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,788
I don't think so. Which?

387
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,498
Anyone else coming
besides Mr. Kentley?

388
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,125
Yes, another old friend of yours.

389
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,794
This.
Even older.

390
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,671
Who?

391
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,881
I could really
strangle you, Brandon.

392
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,049
What have I done now?

393
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,219
At times, your sense
of humor is a little
too malicious, chum.

394
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,054
What are you
chattering about?

395
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,347
Why did you invite Kenneth?

396
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,640
Why not?

397
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,308
You know perfectly well
why not.

398
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,935
We called it quits
ages ago

399
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,312
and I'm practically
engaged to his best friend.

400
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,438
David?

401
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,898
Yes, David.

402
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,150
Which makes everything
just ginger-peachy.

403
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,153
I'm terribly sorry,
but it is
a little difficult

404
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,239
trying to keep up
with your romances.

405
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,701
After me came Kenneth,
now it's David.

406
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,162
Why the switch from Kenneth
to David, anyway?

407
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,331
Obviously,
I think he's nicer.

408
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,417
Well, he's certainly richer.

409
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,921
That's a new low,
even for you, chum.

410
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,798
Gave me a "D" in conduct.

411
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,425
How's your drink doing?
All right.

412
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,468
How many years has
it been since I said,

413
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,846
"Oh, it tickles"?
And don't you tell me.

414
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,180
I hear Rupert's coming.

415
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,391
Well, he was invited,
but you never
know with Rupert.

416
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,642
I hope he does come.
How is he?

417
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,810
Who is he?

418
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,272
Rupert Cadell,
he was our housemaster
at prep school.

419
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,191
Housemaster for you
three little dears?

420
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:44,112
Four little dears.
He tried valiantly
to teach David, too.

421
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,613
Rupert's a publisher
now, isn't he?

422
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,824
Successful?
Maybe he can
give me a job.

423
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:52,412
Rupert only publishes
books he likes,
usually philosophy.

424
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,872
Oh. Small print,
big words, no sales.

425
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,206
Right.

426
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,417
Rupert's extremely radical.

427
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,544
Do you know that he selects
his books on the assumption

428
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,381
that people not only can read,
but actually can think?

429
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,258
Curious fellow,
but I like him.

430
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,426
You always did.

431
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,721
Golly, those bull sessions
you and Rupert used
to have at school.

432
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,432
Brandon would sit
up till all hours
at the master's feet.

433
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,518
Brandon at someone's feet!
Who is this Rupert?

434
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,896
He used to tell you
the weirdest things,
didn't he?

435
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,355
Really?
What sort of things?

436
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,486
I suppose Kenneth means
Rupert's impatience
with social conventions.

437
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:30,492
For example, he thinks
murder is a crime
for most men, but...

438
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,244
A privilege
for the few.

439
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,454
Yes.

440
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,456
A privilege for what few?

441
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,959
It's all right, Mrs. Wilson.
I'll answer the door.

442
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,920
Oh, Mr. Kentley.
So glad you could come.

443
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,254
Thank you, Brandon.

444
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,381
Mrs. Kentley isn't well,
so I took the liberty

445
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,217
of bringing my sister-in-law,
Mrs. Atwater.

446
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,384
She's been staying with us.

447
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,136
Oh, delighted to
have you, Mrs. Atwater.

448
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,846
Delighted to come,
dear boy.

449
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,140
I've been in
New York two weeks.

450
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,392
Alice has been ill
almost the whole time,

451
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,687
and Henry is forever
cataloging his library.

452
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,690
Oh, no, Anita.
Occasionally, I even
read one of my books.

453
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,903
But I'm on a visit, Henry.
This is just my second party.

454
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,613
I suppose
it's only fair...

455
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,281
Let me take your things.
Thank you.

456
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,616
I'm sorry to hear
Mrs. Kentley's so ill.

457
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,784
Oh, it's just a cold.

458
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,453
Oh, colds can be
very dangerous
this time of the year.

459
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,665
I hope Mrs. Kentley's
staying in bed with
lots of fruit juice.

460
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,708
She is, thank you.
Well, that'll do the trick.

461
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:25,088
Colds dangerous,
in this heat? I don't
understand that at all.

462
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,091
Exactly two years
ago this summer,
I had one myself.

463
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,759
I was down for three weeks.

464
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:30,969
The doctors were
just about ready...

465
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,263
Excuse me.
This way, Mrs. Atwater.

466
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,639
...particularly at parties.

467
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,974
Particularly at this party.

468
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,934
This is all
way over my head.

469
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:38,977
David!

470
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,061
Oh, no.

471
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,273
You've made a mistake.
This is Kenneth Lawrence.

472
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,858
I'm so sorry.

473
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,194
That's all right, Anita. Kenneth is often
mistaken for David,

474
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,281
even by people
who aren't nearsighted.

475
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,116
We haven't had
much opportunity

476
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,618
to observe the resemblance
lately, my boy.

477
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,162
Haven't been studying,
have you?

478
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,621
I've been
trying to, sir.

479
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,124
Oh, dear.
The resemblance
is only physical.

480
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,501
I believe you both
know Ms. Walker.

481
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,503
Janet, my dear.

482
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:09,174
I finished working
out your horoscope
just before we came.

483
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,383
Oh, tell.

484
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,011
The stars are very kind.

485
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,181
They indicate
a marriage very soon

486
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:20,935
to a tall,
fair-haired young man
with a very lovely father.

487
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,937
Oh, come, Anita,
I told you that
a week ago.

488
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,606
Oh, well,
I suppose you did.

489
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,191
But the stars confirm it.

490
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,442
Wonderful.

491
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,861
Uh, Mrs. Atwater,
may I present
Mr. Phillip Morgan?

492
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,863
How do you do?
Oh, you've hurt your hand.

493
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,072
Oh, it's nothing,
just a little cut.

494
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,199
What happened?

495
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,035
Nothing. The glass was
cracked and it broke,
that's all.

496
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,661
May I get you some
champagne, Mrs. Atwater?

497
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,538
Oh, I should adore some.

498
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,541
Daddy used to have a glass
every morning at 11:00.

499
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,127
But, of course,
Henry doesn't like it.

500
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,214
Mr. Kentley,
may I get you some?

501
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,632
Well, I'd prefer
a little scotch

502
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,550
with a lot of water
if you don't mind.

503
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,886
Is David here?

504
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,097
I expected him
to come with you.

505
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,141
He called and said
that he'd meet us here.

506
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,643
Where did he call from?

507
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,936
Oh, our maid spoke to him.

508
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,980
He was at the club,
studying for
his examinations.

509
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,067
Tennis.

510
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,612
The trouble with David is
he doesn't have to study.
He's too bright.

511
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,614
Well, David does all right,
very much so.

512
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,282
Thank you.

513
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,034
How's Mrs. Kentley?

514
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,995
As usual,
it's a cold this time.

515
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,332
I hope David arrives soon.
She wants him to call her.

516
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,918
David's her only child,
Mr. Kentley.

517
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,421
He's my only child, too,
but I'm willing
to let him grow up.

518
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,590
Why don't I call
and tell her
he's been detained?

519
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,008
No, you mustn't
pamper her, Janet.

520
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,010
David might even
have stopped off
to see her.

521
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,012
Mr. Kentley?
May I use the phone?

522
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,097
Of course.
It's in the bedroom.

523
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,223
How cozy.

524
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,808
Aren't you ready
for another?

525
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,017
I will be.

526
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,354
I am, thank you.

527
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,439
What a charming young man.

528
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,983
I wish David
saw more of him.

529
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,027
Yes.
I'll go and call.

530
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,614
Kenneth, there's too
much air in your glass.

531
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,991
Oh, mine's fine, thanks.

532
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,617
Would you mind
taking this in to Janet?

533
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,786
Sure. Why?

534
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,413
No particular reason.
It's hers.

535
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,998
I thought you'd like
to take it in to her.

536
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,457
She's in the bedroom,
telephoning.

537
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,084
Then you'd like
David to walk in.

538
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,420
No, no, that'd be
too much of a shock.

539
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,005
When were you born?

540
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,548
July 14.

541
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,300
Can you really tell
my future from that?

542
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,719
Of course, I'm only
an amateur astrologer.

543
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,095
I'm sure you're very good.

544
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,513
I do my best.

545
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,641
I suppose you want to
know if your concert
will be a success?

546
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,101
Yes, I do.

547
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,978
Let me see now.

548
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,106
You were born on
the 14th of July.

549
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,318
You're Cancer, the crab.
You're a moon child.

550
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:37,905
You're very much
influenced by the moon.
May I see your hands?

551
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,908
You don't remember
the hour of your birth,
by any chance?

552
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,160
No.

553
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,498
Good fingers.
Strong. Artistic.

554
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,752
What about the concert?

555
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,048
These hands will
bring you great fame.

556
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,010
Extremely.

557
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,430
Well, I consider myself a very
fortunate man today.

558
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,931
I'm on hand for
the grand opening.

559
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,391
Of what?

560
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,018
Of your collection,
so to speak.

561
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,561
Oh, yes, of course.

562
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,356
Are you going to play?
How lovely.

563
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,024
Your wife
sends her love.

564
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,359
David wasn't there?

565
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,070
No. He'll probably
be here in
a minute, though.

566
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,298
Your touch has
improved, Phillip.

567
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,633
Rupert!

568
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,595
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

569
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,597
You know me
better than that.

570
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,600
Mrs. Atwater, may I present
Mr. Rupert Cadell?

571
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,268
Delighted.
Thank you.

572
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,395
Mr. Kentley.

573
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,479
How do you do,
Mr. Kentley?

574
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,564
Rupert Cadell,
the housemaster
at Somerville?

575
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,732
I used to be.

576
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,567
Then you must have
taught my son, David.

577
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,944
You flatter me.

578
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,695
How do you do?
Hello, chum.

579
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,863
Ms. Walker.

580
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:01,989
How did you know?

581
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,408
Brandon spoke of you.

582
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,742
Did he do me justice?

583
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,329
Do you deserve
justice? Well!

584
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,249
Well, little
Kenneth Lawrence.
How you've grown.

585
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,417
Hello.

586
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,543
Now come, Kenneth.

587
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,211
School's out.
You can say it.

588
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,671
Rupert,
you're the same as ever.

589
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,381
It's awfully good
to see you again.

590
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,465
Why?

591
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,550
Well...

592
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,762
Don't mind me.
Very pleased to
see you again.

593
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,807
And that bears
a curious resemblance
to champagne.

594
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,016
It is.

595
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,144
It's very good
champagne, too.
What's the occasion?

596
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,562
I told you on the phone.

597
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,273
It began as a little
party for Mr. Kentley,

598
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,650
so he could look over
those first editions.

599
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,777
Then it turned out
Phillip and I were
going to the country...

600
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes, you told me that,
too, Brandon.

601
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,156
Did I?
Yeah.

602
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,492
Well, I thought
I'd make it sort of
a farewell for Phillip.

603
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,577
Therefore, champagne?

604
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,619
Yes.

605
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,954
I see.

606
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,789
Well, it's true.

607
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,917
You always did stutter
when you were excited.

608
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,920
Well, I guess
I'm always excited
when I give a party.

609
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,630
-Really?
-Mr. Cadell!

610
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,340
Oh, Mrs. Wilson.

611
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,011
Well, what have we here?

612
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,971
I got that
special pâté you like.

613
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,598
I don't like it anymore.

614
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,807
Oh, no!
No, no, no,

615
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:10,975
I'm just teasing.
Just teasing.

616
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
Oh, you're awful.

617
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,729
Thank you. Thank you.

618
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,731
You'd better get
along with the carving.

619
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,900
The rest of
the things'll be here
in two shakes.

620
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,277
Oh, Mr. Brandon!
I found it.

621
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,113
I haven't the least notion
what it was she lost.

622
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,115
Wonderful Mrs. Wilson.

623
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,368
I may marry her.

624
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,371
It looks heavenly.
I hope David gets here soon.

625
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,623
Yes, where is David?

626
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,957
I haven't
the faintest idea.

627
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,502
But he's so late,
Mr. Kentley's
getting annoyed.

628
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,253
And you?

629
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,922
Me? I'm hungry.

630
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,049
Brandon, exactly
what is this?

631
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,759
A cassone
I got in Italy.

632
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,677
No, I mean why are
we eating off it?

633
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,056
Oh, I've turned
the dining room
into a library.

634
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,600
Trust you to find
a new use for a chest.

635
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,812
One was always turning up
in the bedtime stories
he told in prep school.

636
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:01,692
The Mistletoe Bough,
that was always your
favorite tale, wasn't it?

637
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,277
What was that one about?

638
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,904
I don't remember
exactly how it started.

639
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,322
It was about
a lovely young girl...

640
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,657
She was a bride-to-be.

641
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,701
And on her wedding day,
she playfully hid
herself in a chest.

642
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:11,827
Yes, that's right.

643
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,205
Unfortunately,
it had a spring lock.

644
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,707
Fifty years later,
they found her skeleton.

645
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,668
I don't think
I'll get that playful.

646
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,211
Would you all
please help yourselves?

647
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,173
Talking of skeletons,
have you seen that
new thing at the Strand?

648
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,383
Yes, I adored it.

649
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,509
Did you? Good.

650
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,054
I didn't like
the new girl much.
Definitely Scorpio.

651
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,264
No, I didn't
like her either,

652
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,057
but her clothes
were fabulous.

653
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,392
Simply divine!

654
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,726
Absolute heaven!

655
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,019
I must see it.

656
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,605
Of course, the man
I have a passion for
is James Mason.

657
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,731
Is he good?

658
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,816
Absolutely terrific!

659
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,653
So attractively sinister!
Taurus, the bull, you know?

660
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,280
Very obstinate.
Really?

661
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,240
But I have
a confession to make.

662
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,244
Do you know
I think I like Mason
as much as Errol Flynn?

663
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,912
I'll take Cary Grant,
myself.

664
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,081
Oh, so will I!

665
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,585
Capricorn, the goat.
He leaps divine!

666
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,420
So much... Mmm!
Yes.

667
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,754
Absolutely.

668
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,174
Oh, he was thrilling
in that new thing
with Bergman.

669
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,595
What was it called now?
"The Something
of the Something."

670
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,515
No, that's the other one.
This was just plain
"Something."

671
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,684
It was sort of...
You know?

672
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,768
It's right on
the tip of my tongue.

673
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:18,853
Mine, too.

674
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,814
It was just plain
"Something." I'm sure.
I adored it.

675
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,441
And Bergman!

676
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,276
She's the Virgo type!

677
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,278
Like all these...
You know?

678
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,030
Oh, I think
she's lovely.

679
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,367
I once went to the movies.
I saw Mary Pickford.

680
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,370
I was mad about her!
Didn't you love her?

681
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,414
The Virgo type, rather,
like all of these...

682
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,082
Well, what did you
see her in?

683
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,792
I don't quite recall.

684
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,503
"The Something Something."

685
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,048
Or was it just
plain "Something"?

686
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,799
Really something
rather like that.

687
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,967
I don't believe
you ever went.

688
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,093
Really?

689
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,097
If I were you, I'd go easy on
the pâté, dear.

690
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,307
Calories.

691
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,017
Come on, Kenneth,
don't be polite.

692
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,978
Phillip,
would you mind
helping Mrs. Atwater?

693
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,021
I'd be glad to.

694
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,981
You sit down,
Mrs. Atwater.
I'll bring it to you.

695
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,650
Thank you so much,
dear boy.

696
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,360
I really must
apologize for David.

697
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,861
I can't think
what's keeping him.

698
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,613
He's only in town
for the weekend,
Mr. Kentley,

699
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,573
and David is a very
popular young man.

700
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,493
Here, let me help.
White or dark?

701
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,662
A little of both on this
for Mrs. Atwater.

702
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,246
What about you?

703
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,748
I don't eat it.

704
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,751
How queer. I never
heard of anyone who
didn't eat chicken.

705
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,921
Did you, Brandon?
Oh, you probably did.

706
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,839
Why don't you eat it,
Phillip?

707
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,091
I just don't.

708
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,425
Well, now,
there must be a reason.

709
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,887
Freud says there's a reason
for everything. Even me.

710
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,348
There's no reason, Janet.

711
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,017
As I remember,
Phillip, you have
a very funny reason.

712
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,352
Doesn't he, Brandon?
Yes.

713
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,479
I knew there had to be one.
Now, what is it? Tell.

714
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,730
Oh, it's nothing too much.

715
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,190
Well, I think
it's quite fascinating.

716
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,650
Come on,
Brandon, please.

717
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,278
Well, it happened
about three years ago
in Connecticut.

718
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,531
Mother has a place there,
you know?

719
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,576
We were going to
have chicken, so we
walked over to the farm.

720
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,663
It was a lovely Sunday
morning in late spring.

721
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,708
Across the valley,
the church bells
were ringing.

722
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,835
And in the yard,
Phillip was doing likewise

723
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,878
to the necks of two
or three chickens.

724
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,213
Oh, dear!

725
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,216
It was a task
he usually performed
very competently.

726
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,718
But on this
particular morning,

727
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,721
his touch was, perhaps,
a trifle too delicate,

728
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:20,099
because one of the subjects
for our dinner table
suddenly rebelled.

729
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,183
Like Lazarus, he rose...

730
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,226
That's a lie!

731
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,978
Phillip!

732
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,314
There isn't a word
of truth in the whole story.

733
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,524
I never strangled
a chicken in my life!

734
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,608
Now, look here, Phillip...

735
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,278
I never strangled a chicken,
and you know it.

736
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,449
Forgive me, but
it just seemed very funny,

737
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,744
you two being so intense
about an old, dead chicken.

738
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,913
Sorry. We were
ridiculous and very rude.

739
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,083
I apologize for both
of us and the story.

740
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,334
Well.

741
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,172
Is it all over?

742
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,506
I'm afraid so, Rupert.

743
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,383
Oh, what a pity.

744
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,927
In another moment,
you might have been
strangling each other

745
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,095
instead of a chicken.

746
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Mr. Cadell, really!

747
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,891
No. But a man's
honor was at stake.

748
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,436
And personally,
I think a chicken is
as good a reason for murder

749
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,856
as a blonde, a mattress
full of dollar bills,

750
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,068
or any of the customary,
unimaginative reasons.

751
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,822
Now, you don't
really approve of murder,
Rupert, if I may?

752
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,992
You may, and I do.
Think of the problems
it would solve.

753
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:25,289
Unemployment, poverty,
standing in line
for theater tickets.

754
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,125
I must say, I've had
a perfectly dreadful time

755
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,420
getting tickets
for that new musical,
what's it called?

756
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,546
You know.

757
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,424
"The Something,"
with what's her name?
Mmm-hmm.

758
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,928
My dear Mrs. Atwater,
careful application
of the trigger finger

759
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,972
and a pair of seats
in the first row is
yours for the shooting.

760
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,474
And have you
had any difficulty

761
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,976
getting into our
velvet rope restaurants?

762
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,144
Frightful!

763
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,437
A very simple matter.

764
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,983
A flick of the knife,
madam, and if you'll
kindly step this way.

765
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,779
No, step over
the head waiter's body.

766
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,990
Thank you,
and here's your table.

767
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,283
Rupert, you're the end.

768
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,661
There's a hotel clerk I could cheerfully
flick a knife at.

769
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,998
Oh, no, sorry.
Knives may not be
used on hotel employees.

770
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,627
They are in
the "death by slow
torture" category.

771
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,795
Ohh!

772
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,966
Along with bird lovers,
small children,
and tap dancers.

773
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,843
Landlords, of course,
are another matter.

774
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,972
You seeking an apartment?
Call on our Ms. Sash Weight

775
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,682
of the blunt
instrument department.

776
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,852
What a divine idea!

777
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,604
If it suits your purpose,
merely...

778
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,732
But then we'd all be
murdering each other.

779
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,359
Oh, no. Oh, no.

780
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:40,030
After all, murder is,
or should be, an art,

781
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,534
not one of the seven
lively, perhaps,
but an art nevertheless.

782
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:48,122
As such, the privilege
of committing it
should be reserved

783
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,750
for those few
who are really
superior individuals.

784
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,961
And the victims,
inferior beings

785
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,754
whose lives are
unimportant anyway.

786
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,383
Obviously. Now mind you, I don't
hold with the extremists

787
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,428
who feel that there
should be open season
for murder all year round.

788
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:07,600
No, personally,
I would prefer to have
"Cut a Throat Week."

789
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,684
Oh!

790
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,729
Or "Strangulation Day."

791
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,733
Probably a symptom of
approaching senility,
but I must confess

792
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,403
that I really
don't appreciate
this morbid humor.

793
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,071
Well, the humor
was unintentional.

794
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,573
You're not serious
about these theories?

795
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,033
Of course, he is.

796
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,367
Oh, you're both
pulling my leg.

797
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,744
No. Why do you
think that?

798
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,246
Well, Brandon,
the notion that
murder is an art

799
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,207
which a few superior beings
should be allowed
to practice...

800
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,209
In season!

801
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,669
Now I know
you're not serious.

802
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,087
But I am.

803
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,130
I'm a very serious fellow.

804
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,256
Then may I ask,

805
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,467
who is to decide
the human being is inferior,

806
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,719
and therefore
a suitable victim for murder?

807
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,429
The few who are privileged
to commit murder.

808
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,681
And just who might they be?

809
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,019
Oh, myself, Phillip,

810
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,897
possibly Rupert.

811
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,274
Oh, I'm sorry,
Kenneth, you're out.

812
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,442
Gentlemen, I'm serious.

813
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,610
So are we, Mr. Kentley.

814
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,322
The few are those men
of such intellectual
and cultural superiority

815
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,825
that they're above
the traditional
moral concepts.

816
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,535
Good and evil,
right and wrong,

817
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,329
were invented for
the ordinary, average man,

818
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,747
the inferior man,
because he needs them.

819
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,998
Then obviously you
agree with Nietzsche

820
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,249
and his theory
of the superman.

821
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,210
Yes, I do.
So did Hitler.

822
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,212
Hitler was
a paranoiac savage.

823
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,632
His supermen,
all fascist supermen,
were brainless murderers.

824
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,467
I'd hang any who were left.

825
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,054
But then, you see,
I'd hang them first
for being stupid.

826
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,723
I'd hang all incompetents
and fools anyway.

827
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,058
There are far too
many in the world.

828
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,393
Then perhaps you
should hang me, Brandon,

829
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,978
for I'm convinced I'm
so stupid, I don't know

830
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,604
whether you're
all serious or not.

831
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,439
But in any case,
I'd rather not hear any more

832
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:41,193
of your, forgive me,
contempt for humanity,

833
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,696
and for the standards
of a world that
I believe is civilized.

834
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,863
Civilized?
Yes.

835
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,199
Perhaps what is
called "civilization"
is hypocrisy.

836
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,450
Perhaps.

837
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,660
Well, I'm sure Rupert,
fortunately...

838
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,828
Now, gentlemen. Really...

839
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:51,996
...has the intelligence
and imagination...

840
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,457
Please, Brandon,
I think we've had
just about enough!

841
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,213
Phillip, where did you
put those books you
set out for Mr. Kentley?

842
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,424
I'd very much like
to see them myself,
if I may.

843
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,342
Of course.
They're in the dining room.

844
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,137
Mr. Kentley,
wouldn't you like
to see the books now?

845
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,056
I apologize, sir,
again.

846
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,267
I'm afraid I let
myself get carried away.

847
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,228
Oh, that's quite
all right, my boy.

848
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,730
I think
it's a good collection.

849
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,106
The first editions,
I mean.

850
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,317
Yes, I'd like to
see them. May I use
the telephone first?

851
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,237
I'd like to talk to
my wife. She may have
some word of David.

852
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,864
Of course.
It's this way.

853
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,657
Dear, dear.
I'm afraid Henry...

854
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,950
Uh...

855
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,702
Brandon?
Yes.

856
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,122
You were really
pushing your point
rather hard.

857
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,293
You aren't planning
to do away with a few
inferiors, by any chance?

858
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,711
I'm a creature of whim.
Who knows?

859
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,046
I see.

860
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,089
I think he's definitely Scorpio.

861
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,758
I know exactly what you mean.

862
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:49,053
Uh, Mrs. Atwater,
wouldn't you like
to see the books?

863
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,055
Oh, I'd love it.

864
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,558
Do you know,
when I was a girl,
I used to read quite a bit.

865
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,603
Oh, we all do
strange things
in our childhood.

866
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:04,610
Kenneth, why don't
you switch on the radio
or play some records?

867
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,654
A little atmospheric music
goes a long way.

868
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,410
He is such a sly,
little devil, isn't he?

869
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,872
Bringing us
back together again
with sweet music.

870
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,208
Don't let it get you.
He's always doing
something like this.

871
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,335
I'm going in the other room.

872
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,544
To see the books?

873
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,880
No, to let Brandon see me.

874
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,381
Do you care what he thinks?

875
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,800
I know what he thinks!

876
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,762
He thinks I threw you over
because David has
a bigger bank account.

877
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,181
Then why do you go?

878
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,017
Because...

879
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,436
Because I'm embarrassed
at being here with you.

880
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,522
Oh, Janet.

881
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,607
Never thought I
could be, did you?

882
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,984
Honestly? No.

883
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,739
Well, I am,
and I don't like it
one bit.

884
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,784
I should think
you'd have the decency
to be embarrassed yourself.

885
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,327
Why?

886
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,081
Well, you threw me over,
chum, remember?

887
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,377
My, wouldn't friend Brandon
love to know that?

888
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,463
What's the matter?

889
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,882
Nothing. I'm just thinking.

890
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,467
What about?

891
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,052
Female vanity.

892
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,141
Well, I'm also
embarrassed because...

893
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,809
Go on.

894
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,061
Well, you and David
used to be
such good friends,

895
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,522
and you're not now,
and it's my fault.

896
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,107
I'm such an idiot girl.

897
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,441
No, you're not.

898
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:30,028
Then I'm certainly giving
a good imitation of one.

899
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,657
Why must I try and
be so smart with
everyone but David?

900
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,993
Don't you kid
with David, too?

901
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,873
I relax with David,
thanks to you.

902
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,083
To me?
Yes.

903
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,507
That grim Sunday at Harvard,
when you called it quits,

904
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,510
David took me for a walk.

905
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,889
My chin was about
an inch from the ground.

906
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,850
I just couldn't
be the gay girl.

907
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,853
I just relaxed and
let everything pour out.

908
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,107
The real, real me stuff.

909
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:12,196
Did you hear that phrase?
I hear myself saying
things like that and...

910
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,114
Oh, where's David?
You know,

911
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,201
I'm not very smart.

912
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,453
Why?

913
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,456
I never realized you were...

914
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,711
Brandon and
his atmospheric music.

915
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,631
You are in love
with David, aren't you?

916
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,965
Yes.

917
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,093
I don't get it.

918
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,345
Get what?

919
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,263
Brandon made a crack
when I got here.

920
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,390
He sort of implied
I'd have a better chance
with you again

921
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,516
because David would
be out of the running.

922
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,894
Wait. You mean,
before I got here,

923
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,103
Brandon knew
we had broken...

924
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,521
He even knew
about you and David.

925
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,273
What?

926
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,276
Kenneth, he pretended
to be completely ignorant
when I told him.

927
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,653
He said...
What's going on here, anyway?

928
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,198
I don't know,
but I'm going to find
out once and for all!

929
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,659
Brandon?
Yes?

930
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,535
May I see you for a moment?
Certainly.

931
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,413
Why can't he keep
his hands off people?

932
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,582
Well?

933
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,919
Just exactly what
are you up to, chum?

934
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,462
I'm up to getting
you coffee if you like.

935
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,464
Let's dispense
with the charm.

936
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,424
I'd like to know
why you had the gall
to tell Kenneth

937
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,927
he wouldn't have to
worry very much longer
about David and me?

938
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,929
I don't think
that's precisely
what I said, Kenneth.

939
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,598
It's what you implied,
and I want to know why.

940
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,434
Some women are
quite charming when
they're angry, Janet.

941
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,602
Unfortunately,
you're not.

942
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,770
Cut that out, Brandon.

943
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,855
Well, chivalry
rears its ugly head!

944
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,816
I don't believe
David's coming!

945
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,859
Wait and see.
I don't have to.

946
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,945
He's never this late.
He's never late at all.

947
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,364
And if something had come up,
he'd have phoned.

948
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,534
I think you
deliberately arranged it
so that he wouldn't come.

949
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,119
How clever of me!

950
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,122
I might have known
you couldn't just give
a party for Mr. Kentley.

951
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,082
No, you'd have to
add something that appealed

952
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,334
to your warped
sense of humor.

953
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:52,879
Well, I hope
you've enjoyed yourself,
Brandon. I haven't!

954
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,757
He's really impossible.

955
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,384
You shouldn't
let him upset you so much.

956
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,885
Something gone wrong,
Brandon?

957
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,970
No.

958
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,390
Janet just has
a talent for being
bothersome at times.

959
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,892
However,
I suppose I'd better...

960
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,231
What did you mean,
"Something gone wrong"?

961
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,567
You always plan
your parties so well,

962
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,819
it's odd to have
anything go wrong.

963
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,238
She seems to be
missing David.

964
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,951
As a matter of fact,
I'm beginning to
miss him myself.

965
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,578
Aren't we all?

966
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,998
Two desserts, Mr. Cadell?

967
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,250
One for you
and one for me, my love.

968
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,668
Oh, Mr. C.

969
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,796
Well, the others
don't seem to be in
the mood for ice cream.

970
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,799
No, though they could all do
with a little cooling off.

971
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,595
My, it's a peculiar party,
not that that surprises me.

972
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,722
Why not?

973
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,848
I could have predicted it
this morning.

974
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,517
Both of them must have
got up out of the wrong
side of the bed.

975
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,519
They've been in
a state all day!

976
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,522
Oh, Mr. Brandon says
he's always in a state
when he gives a party.

977
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,024
It's the first time
I've seen it.

978
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,817
Usually, he lets me
prepare everything

979
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,903
in my own way,
but, look at this,

980
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,988
the chicken's
hardly been touched!

981
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,365
Well, what was
so different today?

982
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,657
What wasn't!

983
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,451
Mr. Brandon was
in the maddest rush

984
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,536
for me to clean up
and get the table set.

985
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,538
And, oh,
it looked so lovely!

986
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,874
But then when I
was whisking out
to do the shopping,

987
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,419
he suddenly told me to take
the whole afternoon for it.

988
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:17,923
The whole afternoon,
after that mad rush
in the morning.

989
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,383
Did he say why?

990
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,551
No, just a whim,
I suppose.

991
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,887
But when I came back,
he and Mr. Phillip

992
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,306
were going at it
hammer and tongs.

993
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,392
Oh. What about?

994
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:32,687
Well, now, Mr. Cadell,
even if I did know,
do you think I'd tell?

995
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:33,814
Well, I hope so.

996
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,065
Not me.
Really?

997
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,566
I'm like the grave.
I see.

998
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,277
Look at this mess!
Just makes double the work.

999
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,488
After I have
this cleaned off,

1000
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,075
I just have to
clear all those books
off the dining room table,

1001
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,036
bring them in here,
and put them
back in the chest,

1002
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,496
which is where they
were in the first place.

1003
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,540
Why did you serve
from here, anyway?

1004
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,500
It wasn't my idea.

1005
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,838
I had everything laid out
in the dining room
and it was just beautiful.

1006
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,590
Of course on this thing,
there isn't half of the room.

1007
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,772
Is she still harping
on her table

1008
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,941
and how awkward it is
to serve from this?

1009
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,485
It's really much more
convenient, you know?

1010
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,446
Because this way,
people don't have
to go all the way

1011
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,947
into the dining room
to get their food

1012
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,407
and come all the way
back here to eat it.

1013
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,159
Hmm. Seems to me
they've gone all the way
in there now

1014
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,785
for their dessert
and coffee.

1015
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,998
Mrs. Wilson,
please serve the guests.
Don't lecture them.

1016
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,838
We did get up on the wrong side of
the bed, didn't we?

1017
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,272
I'm in quite
an embarrassing position.

1018
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,482
How do you mean?

1019
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,860
Well, I seem to
be the only one
having a good time.

1020
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,446
You and Mrs. Atwater.

1021
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,868
What's going on, Phillip?

1022
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,537
Would you mind
turning that off?

1023
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,788
Sorry.

1024
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,917
I don't like to play
with light in my eyes.

1025
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,339
You know, Phillip,

1026
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,218
I get quite intrigued
when people don't
answer questions.

1027
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,136
And quite curious.

1028
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,554
Did you ask me a question?

1029
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,474
Yes, Phillip,
I asked you a question.

1030
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,647
Well, what was it?

1031
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,316
I asked you,
"What is going on here?"

1032
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,527
A party.

1033
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,821
Yes, but
a rather peculiar party.

1034
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,032
What's it all about,
Phillip?

1035
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,700
What's what all about?

1036
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,036
Stop playing crime
and punishment, Rupert.

1037
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,955
If you want to know
something, come out
with it! Otherwise...

1038
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,374
No. Temper, temper.

1039
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,042
Don't stop.
I'd like a drink.

1040
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,420
Wait, I'll get it for you.
Keep playing.
What would you like, scotch?

1041
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,130
No, brandy.

1042
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,514
You're very fond
of that little tune,
aren't you?

1043
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:14,975
You know, Phillip,

1044
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,477
I wish I could
come straight out with
what I want to know.

1045
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,605
Unfortunately,
I don't know anything.

1046
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,440
I merely suspect.

1047
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,487
I said that...
I heard you.

1048
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,613
This all right?

1049
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:29,739
Thank you.

1050
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,579
That's fine.

1051
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,748
Do you use this?

1052
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,250
Sometimes.

1053
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,919
I thought only
beginners did.

1054
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,212
I must say...

1055
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,256
All right, Rupert,
I'll ask you.

1056
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,216
What do you suspect?

1057
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,928
Oh, I've forgotten.

1058
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,555
Where's David, Phillip?

1059
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,265
I don't know.

1060
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,267
Why?
Brandon knows.

1061
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,393
Does he?
Doesn't he?

1062
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,936
Not that I know of.
Oh, come now.

1063
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,689
I don't.
Why don't you ask Brandon?

1064
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,232
I have.

1065
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:09,779
But he's too busy
maneuvering the other
two points of the triangle.

1066
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,283
What for, Phillip?
Just what is
Brandon trying to do

1067
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,452
with Janet and Kenneth?

1068
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,414
What's the matter?
What are you laughing at?

1069
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,790
Nothing.

1070
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:25,170
What is it?
What, am I so far
off the track?

1071
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,131
There's nothing
going on at all, Rupert.

1072
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,094
You're...

1073
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,016
...more than usually
allergic to the truth
tonight, Phillip.

1074
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,185
That's the second time
you haven't told it.

1075
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,228
Thanks.
When was the first?

1076
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:45,482
When you said you never
strangled a chicken.

1077
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,235
You're confused.
Brandon dreamt that up

1078
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,820
for the sake of
a very unfunny joke.

1079
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,364
No, he didn't.

1080
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,658
No, he didn't, Phillip.

1081
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,534
And if you'll think
back very carefully,

1082
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,329
you'll realize
that I know he didn't.

1083
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:05,335
About a year ago,
I was up at the farm.
Do you remember?

1084
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:09,839
One morning I saw you
display your handiwork.

1085
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,511
You're quite a good
chicken-strangler,
as I recall.

1086
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,681
Well, I just meant that
Brandon's story wasn't true.

1087
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,973
I didn't mean
I hadn't killed any chickens.

1088
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,183
That's what you said.

1089
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,435
Well, I didn't think
it was a suitable topic
of conversation

1090
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,645
while we were eating!

1091
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,522
You could have said that.
All right, I didn't!

1092
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,400
We're not eating
now, Phillip. What'd
you lie to me for?

1093
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,526
Because I don't
like to talk about...

1094
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,610
About what?

1095
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,070
Strangling...
I can't play with that thing!

1096
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,239
I want you to
have them very much.

1097
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,366
It's extremely
generous of you, Brandon.

1098
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,161
Please, I know you appreciate first editions
far more than I, Mr. Kentley.

1099
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,705
It's really very nice of you, Brandon.

1100
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,039
What's wrong?

1101
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,874
You and Phillip must come to
dinner very soon...

1102
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,251
What's wrong now,
Phillip?

1103
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,211
Don't you want Mr. Kentley
to have the books?

1104
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,714
No. I mean,
I don't care if he
has them, I just...

1105
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,465
What? What?

1106
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,926
I just think it's
a clumsy way of tying
them up that's all.

1107
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,429
David never had any trouble
taking care of himself.

1108
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,389
I know, but I cannot understand this.

1109
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,890
Whenever he's
been detained before,

1110
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,559
he's telephoned.
Isn't that so, Janet?

1111
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,437
Oh, yes. He's always been after me
to be more punctual.

1112
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,855
As well he might.

1113
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,356
You wouldn't
know me these days.

1114
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,775
I'm a new woman.
Punctual as a clock.

1115
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,027
That's very unfeminine, my dear.

1116
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,655
Perhaps, but I prefer manners
to femininity.

1117
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,782
Oh, Henry, you sound
just like Daddy.

1118
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,535
I remember once
when David was very small...

1119
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,121
Take it easy, Phillip.

1120
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,082
Rupert's on to something.
He isn't. Now, let up.

1121
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,250
I've got to have a drink,
Brandon.

1122
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,418
You've had enough.
You're not...

1123
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,795
Take your hand off my arm!

1124
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,592
Don't you ever again
tell me what to do
and what not to do.

1125
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,677
I don't like it, Brandon,
and I'm not going to take it.

1126
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,221
All right,
keep your voice down!

1127
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,891
I hope I didn't
upset Phillip.

1128
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,437
Uh, no, he's more
likely mixing his drinks.

1129
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,189
You seem rather
upset yourself.

1130
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,565
Do I?

1131
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,735
Yes, there's something
upsetting both of you
a great deal,

1132
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,944
something that...

1133
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,905
Excuse me, sir.

1134
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,117
There's a lady phoning
for either Mr. Kentley
or Mrs. Atwater.

1135
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,120
Oh, it must be Alice.
I'll talk to her, Henry.

1136
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,330
All right.

1137
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,456
Down the hall to
your left, dear.

1138
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,291
Thank you.
The first bedroom.

1139
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,795
Mr. Kentley, do you suppose David
could possibly be home?

1140
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,797
I don't know, Janet.
I hope so.

1141
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,632
I hate to throw a damper,

1142
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,550
but if David was home,
I should think

1143
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,511
he'd be calling
instead of Mrs. Kentley.

1144
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,637
Wouldn't you say so,
Brandon?

1145
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,763
I wouldn't know.

1146
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,225
The David I remember was very polite
as well as very punctual.

1147
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,768
He hasn't changed.

1148
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,688
Of course. If he's not at home,
where could he be?

1149
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,148
Don't ask me.
I don't know.

1150
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,735
He might be any number of places,
such as the club,

1151
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,779
or the Bradleys
are giving a party,

1152
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,739
or maybe he went
down to Janet's.

1153
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,115
Why?

1154
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,617
Perhaps he decided
to pick her up after all.

1155
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,161
I phoned my place after I spoke
with Mrs. Kentley.

1156
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,454
He wasn't there?

1157
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,498
No. I left a message
just in case, but...

1158
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,000
We might have a better chance at
finding out where he is now

1159
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,837
if we knew where
he was this afternoon.
What do you think, Brandon?

1160
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,673
I haven't the least idea where
he was this afternoon.

1161
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,801
But don't you think it would help
if we found out where he was?

1162
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,094
I suppose so.

1163
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,805
I know he went to the club
this afternoon to play tennis,

1164
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,765
-and I know that he got there.
-Why?

1165
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,684
Because someone phoned from there

1166
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,519
with a message that
David would meet us here.

1167
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,229
Well, do you know
who gave the message?

1168
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,564
No.

1169
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,858
Well, then, obviously, David
ran into someone

1170
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,443
at the club
who changed his plans.

1171
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,695
You weren't there
this afternoon,

1172
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,863
by any chance,
were you, Kenneth?

1173
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,656
No. I wish I had been.

1174
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,284
I don't suppose
you or Brandon were, Phillip?

1175
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,286
-No.
-Hardly. We had our hands full

1176
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,662
getting ready for the party.

1177
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,039
Oh, there was a lot
to be done this afternoon.

1178
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,332
Well, you know.

1179
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:36,212
Yes, I see. You didn't speak to David
at all today, then?

1180
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,631
No. Why do you ask?

1181
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,425
I just thought that perhaps
he might have called

1182
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,051
to say he'd be late
or something.

1183
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,429
He didn't. Neither Phillip nor I
have talked to David

1184
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,556
since the day we
invited him to the party.

1185
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,057
That's odd.

1186
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,142
What do you mean?

1187
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,229
I thought I heard David on the phone
to Phillip yesterday morning.

1188
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,397
Really?

1189
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,857
Yes, you did.
I'd forgotten.

1190
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,735
Oh? What were you talking to him about?
Did he call about the party?

1191
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,571
Yes, he wanted to make sure about the time,
that was all.

1192
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,907
Here, I'll help
you with that.

1193
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,284
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Cadell.

1194
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,577
Very good.

1195
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,078
That's all right,
Mrs. Wilson.

1196
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,831
You can put the books back
when you come in to
clean in the morning.

1197
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,042
Well, I didn't have
any idea of coming in
in the morning.

1198
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,627
I'm afraid you have to.

1199
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,921
Just let the books
go for now.

1200
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,714
Well, all right.

1201
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:26,596
Henry, Alice hasn't
had a word from David.
She's frantic.

1202
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,097
I better talk to her.

1203
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,392
She hung up.
She began to cry
so badly.

1204
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,061
Oh, Henry, I'm worried.

1205
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,312
What did she say?

1206
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:38,775
She's been calling
every place he might be.
Not once, but several times.

1207
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,779
And now, Henry,
she thinks he may
have had an accident.

1208
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,739
She wants you to
call the police.

1209
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,990
The police?

1210
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,911
Oh, no, Anita, I don't think
that's necessary.

1211
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,455
David's no longer a child.

1212
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,958
I'm quite sure
he's all right. I...

1213
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,837
Brandon, I think
I'd better go home.
My wife needs me.

1214
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,798
This isn't like
David. He...

1215
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,967
Of course.
I understand.

1216
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,468
May I go with you,
Mr. Kentley?

1217
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,844
Thank you, Janet.

1218
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,638
I'll get your things.
Thank you.

1219
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,557
Oh, Mr. Kentley,
your books.

1220
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,476
Oh. Yes.

1221
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,396
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

1222
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,523
Would you call me
as soon as you
hear from David?

1223
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,649
Be glad to.

1224
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,694
I'm sure the dear boy will
turn up somehow.

1225
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,820
Janet.

1226
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:24,988
Yes?

1227
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,658
This is hardly the time,
but I'm very glad
we had that talk.

1228
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,326
So am I.

1229
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,577
And David will be, too.

1230
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,829
Good.

1231
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,831
Well...

1232
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,666
Kenneth, why don't
you come along with us?

1233
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,668
Oh, I don't...
Please.

1234
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,795
Thanks.

1235
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,005
This yours, Janet?

1236
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,965
Yes, I'll just carry it.

1237
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,009
Oh... Thanks.

1238
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,260
I'll get my hat.

1239
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,469
Going with Janet?

1240
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,346
Yes, we're all
going together.

1241
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,140
Well, what did
I predict?

1242
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,895
Good night,
Mr. Kentley.

1243
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,731
I hope Mrs. Kentley's
feeling better very soon.

1244
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,815
Thank you.

1245
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,276
Uh... You will call me the moment
you hear from David?

1246
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,610
I will.

1247
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,862
Say good night
to Phillip for me.

1248
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,030
I'll get your hat, Mr. Cadell.

1249
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,865
Mrs. Atwater,
thank you so much for coming.

1250
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:13,036
Thank you for letting me come. I'm
so sorry we have to leave.

1251
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,203
Good-bye.

1252
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,830
-Good night.
-Good-bye.

1253
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,166
That's not yours.

1254
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,086
I'm very sorry
we had to spoil it.

1255
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,172
You couldn't possibly spoil it,
Mr. Kentley.

1256
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,632
Well, I meant by leaving so early.

1257
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,676
Good night. Be careful
of those stairs, Anita.
Here we are.

1258
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,386
I'm all right.

1259
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,888
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.

1260
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,389
Good night,
Mr. Cadell.

1261
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,682
You going, too?

1262
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,143
Yes. Yes, I must.
Good night.

1263
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,686
Good night.

1264
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,605
Can I help you with those books,
Mr. Kentley?

1265
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:41,689
Thank you.

1266
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,507
Thank you for
a lovely evening.

1267
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,967
Good night, good night.
It's been charming.

1268
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:15,431
Oh, Phillip, this party
really deserves to
go down in history.

1269
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,727
Well, come on, it's over,
and it couldn't have
gone more beautifully.

1270
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,105
Yes, it could.
Without Rupert.

1271
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,272
Oh, but he was brilliant.

1272
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,440
He helped me
say all the things

1273
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:25,858
I've wanted to say
to those idiots.

1274
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,402
He gave the party
the very touch I predicted.

1275
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,279
The touch of what?

1276
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:34,784
Prying? Snooping?
Or just plain pumping?

1277
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,744
Do you know how busy
he was questioning me?

1278
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,246
About what?

1279
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,164
Oh, what difference?

1280
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,126
You were busy in there
arranging that other
little touch of yours.

1281
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,544
What touch?

1282
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,587
Tying up the books
that way.

1283
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,132
Oh, I thought
that was wonderful.
Didn't you like it?

1284
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,926
No, Brandon, I didn't
like it one bit.

1285
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,719
You'll ruin everything
with your neat
little touches.

1286
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,389
Be quiet.
Mrs. Wilson's still here.

1287
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,644
Determined to get drunk,
aren't you?

1288
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,146
I am drunk.

1289
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,649
And just as childish
as you were before
when you called me a liar.

1290
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,317
You had no business
telling that story.

1291
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,777
Why did you lie, anyway?

1292
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,321
I had to.
Have you ever bothered,

1293
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:15,324
for just one minute,
to understand how
someone else might feel?

1294
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,993
I'm not sentimental
if that's what you mean.

1295
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,120
No, that's not what I mean,
but it doesn't matter.

1296
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:23,207
Nothing matters,
except that Mr. Brandon
liked the party.

1297
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:28,087
Mr. Brandon gave the party.
Mr. Brandon had
a delightful evening.

1298
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,381
Well, I had
a rotten evening.

1299
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,801
Keep drinking and you'll
have a worse morning.

1300
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:37,263
At least if
I have a hangover,
it'll be all mine.

1301
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,435
You know, Phillip,
I've been thinking.

1302
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,062
We deserve a real holiday
after it's all over.

1303
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,981
Where would you like to go?

1304
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,525
Of course, I think
we should come back here
for a few days, first.

1305
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,860
Otherwise, it might
look a little like...

1306
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,614
I've been praying
I'd wake up and find
we hadn't done it yet.

1307
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,073
But why?

1308
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,997
I'm scared to death,
Brandon. I think we're
going to get caught.

1309
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,540
Oh, there's not a chance.

1310
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,043
There was, I suppose,
but not anymore.
Why, we're...

1311
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,756
Uh... Is that you,
Mrs. Wilson?

1312
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,384
Yes. I'll need a key to get in
and clean up in the morning.

1313
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,095
That is if you're
still driving up
to the farm tonight.

1314
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,722
Oh, we're driving up,
all right.

1315
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,935
Oh, well, that's good.
You don't look well,
either one of you. Thanks.

1316
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,937
Of course, I could
do with a rest myself.

1317
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,398
But I want both of you
to come back in tip-top,
A-one shape.

1318
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,858
We will.
Well, I'm off.

1319
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,862
Enjoy yourselves.
Don't forget to write.

1320
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,657
And mind your P's and Q's.
Mmm-hmm.

1321
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,248
Who are you calling?

1322
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,791
Only the garage.

1323
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,169
Hello?
This is Mr. Brandon Shaw.

1324
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:54,507
Would you send
my car around, please?
Yes, right away. Thank you.

1325
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,322
We'd better
draw the curtains.

1326
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,039
Who's that?
Brandon, who's that?

1327
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,250
Probably the garage man
with my car keys.
Answer it.

1328
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,127
There hasn't been
time for him to get here.

1329
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,671
Then maybe Mrs. Wilson
forgot something.
Answer it.

1330
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,882
Brandon, couldn't we pretend
we're not home?

1331
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,927
With all these lights on?
Answer it, Phillip.

1332
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,653
Who is it?

1333
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,868
Brandon. Brandon,
it's Rupert.

1334
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,161
What?

1335
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,872
He wants to come up.
He says he left
a cigarette case here.

1336
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,290
He wants to come up.

1337
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,958
Well, let him come.

1338
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,835
But you know he's lying!
He's caught on!
He didn't leave...

1339
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,295
Shut up and get
back to that phone.

1340
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,671
I won't.

1341
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:16,839
Get back to that phone.

1342
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,965
Brandon, I can't.

1343
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,967
You've got to.
No! He knows!

1344
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:21,469
Shut up!

1345
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,944
Rupert? Come on up.

1346
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:46,452
No, of course not.
He's just a little tight.

1347
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,416
No, but we'll find it
in no time.

1348
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,960
Right.

1349
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,722
Phillip.
Phillip, listen to me.

1350
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,518
Rupert's on his way up now,
and you've got to
pull yourself together.

1351
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:13,562
Phillip, did you hear me?

1352
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,898
Come on,
have another drink
if you must,

1353
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,902
but get hold of yourself
and keep your mouth shut.

1354
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,780
It'll be over
in five minutes.

1355
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,575
I don't know how much,
if anything, Rupert knows,

1356
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,285
but I promise you,

1357
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:32,123
he'll be out of
here in five minutes,
one way or the other.

1358
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,126
Phillip,
for those five minutes,

1359
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,128
you've got to pull
yourself together.

1360
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,295
Brandon, Brandon...

1361
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,422
Now look,

1362
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:45,094
I'm not going to
get caught because of
you or anyone else.

1363
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,847
No one is going to
get in my way now.

1364
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,625
Brandon, it's not
loaded, is it?

1365
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,468
Sorry to bother you, Brandon.

1366
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,011
It's no bother
at all. Come in.

1367
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,554
I knew you were
leaving tonight,

1368
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,390
and I didn't want to
be left without my case.

1369
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,017
Hello, Phillip.
Hello.

1370
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,477
I didn't mean to
alarm you before.

1371
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:35,853
You didn't alarm him.

1372
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,647
I'm afraid Phillip's
a little antisocial tonight.

1373
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,774
Oh? I thought perhaps...

1374
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,818
Any idea where
you left the case?

1375
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:44,820
No. No, none at all.

1376
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,657
Completely unlike me
to forget it, isn't it?

1377
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:53,120
I suppose a psychoanalyst
would say that I didn't
really forget it at all.

1378
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,707
I unconsciously left it
because I wanted
to come back.

1379
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:03,339
But why should I
want to come back?

1380
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,882
Yes, why?

1381
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,927
For the pleasure
of our company,
or another drink.

1382
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,179
Well, that's a very
good idea. May I have
one for the road?

1383
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,097
Of course. A short one?

1384
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,517
No, I'd prefer a long one
if you don't mind.

1385
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,684
Not at all.

1386
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,520
Phillip, will you
fix Rupert a drink?

1387
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,271
Now let me see.

1388
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,107
The last I remember
having the case

1389
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,694
was when I was there.

1390
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,533
I was just going to
open the chest
for Mrs. Wilson

1391
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,952
when you came over, Brandon.

1392
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,120
And then what?

1393
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,627
I think I...

1394
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,132
Wonder where it could be.

1395
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:48,968
Oh.

1396
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:50,928
Well, here it is
right where I left it.

1397
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,973
Gentlemen,
I beg your pardon.
I'm very sorry.

1398
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,103
Well, may I have
that drink anyway?

1399
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,563
Of course.

1400
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,772
You really don't mind?

1401
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,357
No. Why should we?

1402
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,567
Well, you might be...

1403
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,693
What?

1404
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,445
Tired. You're sure
it's all right?

1405
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,863
He said
you could have it.

1406
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,198
Thank you.
Don't mind Phillip.

1407
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:13,826
I'm afraid he's
had a few too many.

1408
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,247
Well, why not? Why not?
After all, it was a party.

1409
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,503
Well, it's very
pleasant to sit here

1410
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,339
with a good drink
and good company.

1411
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,757
I'm glad.

1412
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,762
Please don't let me
be in the way.

1413
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,139
Of what?

1414
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,682
Well, I know you
have things to do.

1415
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,891
What do you mean?

1416
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,102
Oh, packing,
last-minute odds and ends.

1417
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,479
You are driving up to
Connecticut tonight,
aren't you?

1418
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,481
Yes, but
we're all packed.

1419
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:47,401
Oh, I see.
All ready.

1420
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,613
All except one guest,
who must be gotten rid of.

1421
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,449
Well, I'll be off,

1422
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,243
as soon as
I finish my drink.

1423
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,331
There's no need
to hurry, Rupert.

1424
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,751
Thank you. I would
like to stay a bit.

1425
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,212
Perhaps even
see you off.

1426
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,634
I always hate
to leave a party,

1427
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:17,014
especially when
the evening has been
unusually stimulating,

1428
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,852
or strange,
like this evening.

1429
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,188
What do you mean
"strange"?

1430
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,776
Did I say "strange,"
Brandon?

1431
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,613
Well, you often
pick words for sound
rather than meaning.

1432
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,115
I don't exactly
know what I meant,

1433
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,078
unless I was
thinking about David.

1434
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,833
What was strange
about David?

1435
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,168
His not showing up.

1436
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,380
You don't think
anything really did
happen to him, do you?

1437
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,090
What could have?

1438
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,092
He could have been
run over or held up.

1439
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,802
In broad daylight?

1440
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,428
That's right.
I'd forgotten.

1441
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:01,225
Yes, it must have
been broad daylight
when it happened.

1442
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,688
When what happened?

1443
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:10,275
When whatever did
happen to David.

1444
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,529
Nothing, probably.

1445
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:21,412
Still, where is he?

1446
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,330
What's your theory?

1447
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,498
Mine?

1448
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,292
I was considering
Janet's for the moment.

1449
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,002
I didn't know she had one.

1450
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,671
Yes, you do.

1451
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,298
I couldn't help
overhearing Janet.

1452
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,801
I gather she thinks
you kidnapped David,

1453
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,053
or did something
to prevent him from coming.

1454
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,222
I'm not interested
in Janet's prattle,

1455
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,099
but you always
interest me, Rupert.

1456
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,352
Do you think
I kidnapped David?

1457
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,146
Well,
it's the sort of mischief

1458
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,856
that would have
appealed to you in school

1459
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,151
for the experience,
the excitement,
the danger.

1460
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,486
But it would be
slightly more difficult

1461
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,364
to pull off now,
though, don't you think?

1462
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,449
You'd find a way.

1463
01:07:58,533 --> 01:07:59,533
How?

1464
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,911
I mean, suppose you were I.

1465
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,914
How would you get David
out of the way?

1466
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,041
You're much better
at this sort of thing
than I am.

1467
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:11,003
No, but what would
you do if you were I?

1468
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,885
Well, if I wanted
to get rid of David,

1469
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:23,223
I'd invite him for
a drink at the club
or some quiet bar,

1470
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,476
or better still,
I'd invite him here.

1471
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,186
Then no one would
see us together.

1472
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,854
That's good.
And no witnesses.

1473
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,105
Yes, that's right.

1474
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,273
Then what?

1475
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:35,778
Well...

1476
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,866
Well, let me see.

1477
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,788
At the appointed time,
David would arrive,

1478
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:49,875
I'd walk slowly out of
the room into the hall,
and greet him.

1479
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,128
Tell him how fine
he's looking and so forth,

1480
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,547
and take his hat.

1481
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,760
And I'd bring him in here,

1482
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:03,597
make some small talk
to put him at his ease,

1483
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,933
probably offer him a drink,

1484
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,228
and then he'd sit down.

1485
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,437
Yes?

1486
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:14,358
I'd try to make it all very pleasant,
you understand?

1487
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,070
Phillip would
probably play the piano.

1488
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,991
Now, as I recall,
David was quite strong.

1489
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,244
He'd have to be knocked out.

1490
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,413
So I'd move quietly
around behind the chair

1491
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,999
and hit him on
the head with something.

1492
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,379
His body would fall
forward on the floor.

1493
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,756
Then where would
you put him?

1494
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,430
Well...

1495
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,474
Uh...

1496
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,894
Well, let me see.

1497
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:58,110
Well, I think I'd
get Phillip to help me
carry him out of the room,

1498
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:02,447
down the back stairs,
and the two of us
would put him into the car.

1499
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,033
You'd be seen.
What?

1500
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,536
Well, you said yourself
that if anything did happen,

1501
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,038
it must have happened
in broad daylight.

1502
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,874
Oh, that's right.
I'd forgotten.

1503
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,043
That means I'd have to
find someplace to
hide the body until dark.

1504
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:18,046
Yes, you would,
but where, Rupert?

1505
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,841
Yes.

1506
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,053
Yes, where?

1507
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,309
Cat and mouse!
Cat and mouse!

1508
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,476
Phillip!

1509
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,520
Which is the cat
and which is the mouse?

1510
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:34,730
That's enough of that.

1511
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:35,898
Mind your own business.

1512
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:36,982
That's enough, Phillip!

1513
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,985
I told you before,
mind your own business!

1514
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:45,490
It really isn't
any of my business.
I'm not his keeper.

1515
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,453
With him in
this condition, though,

1516
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:53,040
there doesn't
seem to be much point
in your staying, Rupert.

1517
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,542
That is,
unless you came back

1518
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:59,087
to find something
besides your cigarette case.

1519
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,424
You mean, for example,
to find if you
really got rid of David?

1520
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,301
Yes, that's what I mean.

1521
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,136
Oh, you're as
romantic as Janet.

1522
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,473
I don't think for a moment
that you kidnapped David.

1523
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,768
Oh, I will admit that Janet
put the notion in my head,

1524
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,978
but I never would
have mentioned it

1525
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:19,650
if it weren't that you
seem to be carrying fear
of discovery in your pocket.

1526
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,859
What?

1527
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,027
That's a gun, isn't it?

1528
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:27,282
That teased my suspicions
more than anything else.

1529
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,076
And to tell you the truth,

1530
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,412
it really scares me
a little.

1531
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:37,626
I'm terribly sorry, Rupert.
I don't blame you,
but, well, here.

1532
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,128
You can relax.
I have to take it
up to the country.

1533
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:43,340
There've been
several burglaries,
and Mother's a bit on edge.

1534
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,593
Finished, Phillip?

1535
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,970
All right.

1536
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,263
Did you hear what Rupert said
about the gun?

1537
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,099
He thought...

1538
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,519
It's odd the way
one can pyramid

1539
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,771
simple facts into
wild fantasies,
isn't it?

1540
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,398
We all do it,
don't we, Phillip?

1541
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,565
Yes.

1542
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:05,153
Particularly after a few drinks.
How is yours, Rupert?

1543
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,572
I think I'll be running along.

1544
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,032
Phillip, you'll feel much better

1545
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:10,450
once you get out
in the open air.

1546
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,285
I don't think
there'll be much traffic,

1547
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,079
and we ought to
make good time.

1548
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,582
It's a lovely night. You'll be driving
up in good weather.

1549
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:22,004
I almost wish
I were going with you.
It might be rather exciting.

1550
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:25,590
Driving at night always is,

1551
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,176
but driving with
you and Phillip now

1552
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,639
might have an additional
element of suspense.

1553
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:39,312
You were right, Phillip.
Those books
were tied clumsily.

1554
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:40,605
He's got it.

1555
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,857
He's got it!
Phillip!

1556
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,234
He knows.
He knows. He knows.

1557
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,153
All right, Phillip.
Easy. I'll take
care of it.

1558
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:47,988
He knows!
No, you won't.

1559
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:52,451
I'd just as soon kill
you as kill him. Sooner!

1560
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,370
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?
Somebody else to know.

1561
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:59,041
Somebody else to see
how brilliant you are,
just like at school.

1562
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,502
I told you he'd
find out, but, oh, no! No,
you had to have him here.

1563
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,004
And now we're done for!
Shut up! Shut up!

1564
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,424
No! You made me do it,
and I hate you.
I hate both of us! I...

1565
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,565
Stupid, babbling drunk.

1566
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,900
I'm sorry, Rupert.

1567
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,193
It's all right.

1568
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,363
It's all right.
If you really
want to kill,

1569
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,656
you don't miss,
not at that range.

1570
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,158
Of course he didn't
want to kill you.

1571
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,118
He didn't know
what he was doing,

1572
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,163
any more than he knew
what he was saying.

1573
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,748
I didn't want
anyone to know this,

1574
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,333
but he's been becoming
an alcoholic, Rupert.

1575
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,377
Brandon, will you
step over there, please?

1576
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,713
Phillip's drunk, Rupert.

1577
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:49,591
Surely you don't take
those nightmare ideas
of his seriously?

1578
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,051
Brandon.

1579
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,262
Brandon, I'm tired.

1580
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,557
And in a way,
I'm frightened, too.

1581
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,185
But I don't want
to fence anymore.

1582
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,478
What are you going to do?

1583
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,230
I don't want to,

1584
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,108
but I'm gonna look
inside that chest.

1585
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,442
Are you crazy?

1586
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:10,278
I hope so.
With all my heart,
I hope I'm crazy.

1587
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,446
Rupert, this has
nothing to do with you.

1588
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,614
I've got to.

1589
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,616
Don't! Rupert!
I've got to look
inside that chest.

1590
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,495
All right!
Go ahead and look.

1591
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,456
I hope you like
what you see.

1592
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,685
Oh, no. No!

1593
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,270
Rupert...

1594
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,897
I couldn't
believe it was true.

1595
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,066
Rupert, please.

1596
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,151
Please what?

1597
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,945
Listen to me.
Just listen. Let me explain.

1598
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,239
Explain? Do you think
you can explain that?

1599
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,407
Yes, to you I can.

1600
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,409
Because you'll understand.
Understand?

1601
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,661
Rupert. Rupert,
remember the discussion

1602
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,538
we had before
with Mr. Kentley?

1603
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:02,914
Yes.
Remember we said,

1604
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,001
"The lives of inferior beings
are unimportant"?

1605
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:09,671
Remember we said...
We've always said,
you and I,

1606
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:14,009
that moral concepts
of good and evil
and right and wrong

1607
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,428
don't hold for
the intellectually superior.

1608
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,888
Remember, Rupert?

1609
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,306
Yes, I remember.

1610
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:23,310
Well, that's all
we've done. That's all
Phillip and I have done.

1611
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:26,730
He and I have lived
what you and I have talked.

1612
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:29,566
I knew you'd understand,
because you have to,
don't you see?

1613
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,109
You have to.

1614
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,292
Brandon.

1615
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,466
Brandon,
till this very moment,

1616
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,385
this world
and the people in it

1617
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:01,014
have always been dark
and incomprehensible to me.

1618
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:07,145
And I've tried to clear
my way with logic
and superior intellect.

1619
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:12,234
And you've thrown
my own words right back
in my face, Brandon.

1620
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,194
You were right to.
If nothing else,

1621
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,821
a man should
stand by his words.

1622
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:20,951
But you've given my words
a meaning that
I never dreamed of!

1623
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,788
And you've tried to
twist them into a cold,

1624
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,749
logical excuse for
your ugly murder!

1625
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,836
Well, they never
were that, Brandon.

1626
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,881
And you can't
make them that.

1627
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:38,760
There must have been
something deep inside you
from the very start

1628
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,929
that let you do this thing.

1629
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,724
But there's always
been something
deep inside me

1630
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,143
that would never
let me do it,

1631
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,937
and would never let me
be a party to it now.

1632
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,105
What do you mean?

1633
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:54,484
I mean that tonight
you've made me ashamed
of every concept I ever had

1634
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,153
of superior or
inferior beings.

1635
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:01,783
But I thank you
for that shame,
because now I know

1636
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:06,371
that we are each of us
a separate human being,
Brandon,

1637
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,583
with the right to
live and work and
think as individuals,

1638
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:13,878
but with an obligation
to the society we live in.

1639
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,299
By what right do you dare say

1640
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,635
that there's a superior few
to which you belong?

1641
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,764
By what right
did you dare decide

1642
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:29,394
that that boy in there
was inferior and therefore
could be killed?

1643
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,315
Did you think
you were God, Brandon?

1644
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,693
Is that what you thought
when you choked
the life out of him?

1645
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:40,280
Is that what you thought
when you served food
from his grave?

1646
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,699
I don't know
what you thought,
or what you are,

1647
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,200
but I know
what you've done.

1648
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,077
You've murdered!

1649
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,997
You've strangled the life
out of a fellow human being

1650
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:54,002
who could live and love
as you never could,
and never will again.

1651
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,128
What are you doing?

1652
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,212
It's not what I'm
going to do, Brandon.

1653
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,797
It's what
society's going to do.

1654
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,508
I don't know
what that will be,
but I can guess.

1655
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:04,262
And I can help.
You're going to die,
Brandon, both of you!

1656
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,639
You're going to die.

1657
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,700
Was that a gun?

1658
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:27,410
Yes, there were
three shots fired.

1659
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,620
It must be
in the next street.

1660
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,246
Did you see
the firing from the gun?

1661
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,831
No, we thought
it came from the next street.

1662
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,708
No, I saw them back there.
There were three!

1663
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,168
Did you hear
that gun fired?

1664
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,544
Yeah, they came
from up there.

1665
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:39,297
There were shots
fired, weren't there?

1666
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:46,012
I think we better have somebody
call the police.

1667
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,431
Did any of you
hear any shots fired?

1668
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:49,808
Yes.

1669
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,437
Somebody better
call the fire department.

1670
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:56,648
Can I use your phone?

1671
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,479
Here comes
a squad car now.

1672
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,235
They're coming.
