1
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,663
Hey, sheriff.

2
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:34,321
A Mercury is a real good car.

3
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,615
That was the car
I was driving that day.

4
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,539
I owned a lot of cars.

5
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,084
Yeah, different kinds.

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,046
A lot of different kinds of cars.

7
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,841
She was standing, this girl...

8
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,344
on the side of the street
by this chicken stand.

9
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,638
Not the Colonel's,
a different chicken stand.

10
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,599
I pulled the Mercury up alongside...

11
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,936
and rolled down the window
by electric power.

12
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,482
And she had this leather skirt on...

13
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,735
and she had a lot of hair
on her arms.

14
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,030
I like that. It means a big bush,
which I like.

15
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:25,706
She says, "Are you dating?"
You know?

16
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,208
I said, "Sure."
So she gets in...

17
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,920
and we pull off into...

18
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,424
this remote location
comfortable for both of us.

19
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,136
She says, "How much
do you want to spend?"

20
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,639
I said, "Enough to see
your bush. I know it's big."

21
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,142
She says, "$25."

22
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,941
That's not chicken feed
to a working man.

23
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,236
I produce the $25,
she sticks it in her shoe...

24
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,322
pulls up her skirt...

25
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:04,203
and there is thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis.

26
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,794
You can imagine I wanted my $25 back.

27
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,510
Why are you weirded out?

28
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,721
It's not San Quentin.
It's a nut house.

29
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,849
Most patients don't know where
they are. They won't hurt you.

30
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,019
It doesn't bother you we'll be facing
a killer in a few minutes?

31
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,647
You wanted to major in journalism.

32
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,321
They're from that newspaper deal.

33
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,949
- From the college?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,826
- I'm Jerry Woolridge.
- I'm Marsha Dwiggins.

35
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,746
She's Theresa Evans.
She's here to take pictures.

36
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,208
Y'all sit down.

37
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,338
A man named John Leggitt Hunter
had a filling station.

38
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,714
A good filling station business.

39
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,218
He was the type of person
that I'm sure you've met too...

40
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,220
who didn't deserve what he had.

41
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,016
One thing he had was...

42
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,019
this beautiful, young bride,
Sarah.

43
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,940
She was a Georgia peach.

44
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,737
She was more like the picture I had
in my mind than any woman I'd seen.

45
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,116
So I took her away
from John Leggitt Hunter...

46
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,244
who did not deserve her.

47
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,330
Oh, I don't know if I told you...

48
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,542
but he was a Frenchman
who claimed to be an Englishman.

49
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,424
Took strong nylon cord
to get her away from him.

50
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,218
She was a fighter and a Georgia peach.

51
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,517
There must have been a mix-up.

52
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,022
I talked to your sponsor,
teacher or whoever...

53
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,317
and told him no pictures.

54
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,446
This is for an article
or something, right?

55
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,242
Yeah, it's for the school newspaper
which has pictures.

56
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,911
It's a regular paper.

57
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,122
Karl's real sensitive
about having his picture made.

58
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,542
He wouldn't be on the bulletin board
for the Easter collage.

59
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,548
Now...

60
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,510
a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

61
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,230
I'll talk to him, see what he says.

62
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,610
You gotta make something explode
to truly understand it.

63
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,948
You gotta examine all those particles
while they're still on fire.

64
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,911
Karl, let's go down
to the old classroom.

65
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,914
Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see.

66
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,918
Let's go.

67
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,815
Remember I told you about
those newspaper people?

68
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,943
They want to ask you questions
about your release.

69
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,946
They think it'll make a good story.

70
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,032
Will you talk to them?
Get interviewed?

71
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,036
They're women.

72
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:41,712
I think it'd be good for you. You'll see
all kinds of people on the outside.

73
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,714
This'll help.

74
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:55,642
Now, he'll only talk to you
but you can't ask him anything...

75
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,644
and don't stare at him.

76
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,230
How can I interview him
if I can't ask any questions?

77
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,524
Sorry, that's the best it's gonna get.

78
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
Can I ask you a question?

79
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,613
If he's so troubled,
why are you letting him out?

80
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,532
What if he does it again?
It happens.

81
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,410
His time's up.
That's the rules.

82
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,914
He's been treated, reevaluated,
doesn't show any signs anymore.

83
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,750
- Signs?
- Homicidal signs.

84
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:25,047
Miss, I'm sorry,
but you'll have to step outside.

85
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,633
- Why?
- Please?

86
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:41,021
I have to change
the light in here for Karl.

87
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,732
I hope you can still see to write.

88
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,111
I reckon what you want to know
is what I'm doing in here.

89
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,947
I reckon it's because I killed somebody.

90
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,120
But I reckon you want to know
how come I killed somebody...

91
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,622
so I'll start at the front
and tell you.

92
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:48,922
I lived out in back of
my parents' place most of my life...

93
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,843
in a little old shed
that my daddy'd built for me.

94
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,222
They didn't want me in the house
with the rest of them...

95
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,851
so I sat around in the shed
looking at the ground.

96
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,939
I didn't have no floor...

97
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,235
but I had me a hole dug out
to lay down in...

98
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,446
a quilt or two to put down there.

99
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,618
My father...

100
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,913
was a hardworking man
most of his life...

101
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,625
not that I can say the same
for myself.

102
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,044
I mostly just sat around
in the shed...

103
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,213
tinkered around
with a lawn mower or two...

104
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,134
went to school off and on
from time to time.

105
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:39,431
But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me...

106
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:43,936
and made quite a bit of sport of me,
made fun of me quite a bit.

107
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:49,233
So mostly I just sat around
out there in the shed.

108
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,113
My daddy...

109
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,033
worked at the sawmill,
down at the planer mill...

110
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,911
for an old man named Dixon.

111
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,539
Old man Dixon was a very cruel fellow.

112
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,125
Didn't treat his employees well
or pay them well.

113
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,045
Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.

114
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,631
Just barely enough to get by,
I reckon.

115
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,176
I reckon he got by all right.

116
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,640
They used to come out,
one or the other of them...

117
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,143
usually my mother...

118
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,521
feed me pretty regular.

119
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,692
So I know he made enough
so I could have mustard and biscuits...

120
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,236
three or four times a week.

121
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,033
But old man Dixon...

122
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,035
he had a boy...

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,831
name of Jesse Dixon.

124
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,626
Jesse was more cruel
than his daddy was.

125
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,213
He used to make
quite a bit of sport of me...

126
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,924
when I was down there
at the schoolhouse.

127
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,472
Used to take advantage of the girls
in the neighborhood.

128
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,228
They used to say...

129
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,440
that my mother was a very pretty woman.

130
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,737
They said that quite a bit
when I'd be there at the schoolhouse.

131
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,825
I reckon you want me to get on with it
and tell you what happened.

132
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,827
So I reckon I'll tell you.

133
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,540
I was setting out in the shed
one evening, not doing much...

134
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,126
just staring at the wall...

135
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,296
and waiting on my mother
to give me my Bible lesson.

136
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,345
I heard a commotion in the house...

137
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,015
so I run up on the screened-in porch
to look inside.

138
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,811
I looked in and seen my mother laying
on the floor without any clothes on.

139
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,529
I seen Jesse Dixon
laying on top of her.

140
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,117
He was having his way with her.

141
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,621
I just seen red.

142
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,546
I picked up a Kaiser blade that was
sitting by the door.

143
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,716
Some folks called it a sling blade.
I called it a Kaiser blade.

144
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,846
It's got a long, wood handle,
kind of like an ax handle...

145
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,849
with a long blade shaped like a banana.

146
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,644
Sharp on one edge
and dull on the other.

147
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:36,400
It's what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot. Yeah.

148
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,238
I went in the house...

149
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,117
and I hit Jesse Dixon
upside the head with it...

150
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,119
knocked him off my mother.

151
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,707
I reckon that didn't satisfy me...

152
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,128
so I hit him again in the neck
with the sharp edge...

153
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,840
and just plumb near cut his head off,
killed him.

154
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,053
My mother jumped up
and started hollering...

155
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,098
"What did you kill Jesse for?"

156
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,934
Well, come to find out...

157
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,021
my mother didn't mind
what Jesse was doing to her.

158
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,526
That made me madder
than what Jesse'd made me...

159
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,945
so I took the Kaiser blade--

160
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,324
some folks called it a sling blade,
I called it a Kaiser blade--

161
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,245
and I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

162
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,167
Killed her.

163
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,761
Some folks asked me:
if you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?

164
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,096
I reckon I would.

165
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,017
Anyhow, they put me in here...

166
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,479
and here I been
for a great, long while.

167
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,067
I've learned to read some.

168
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,654
Took me four years to read the Bible.

169
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,824
I reckon I understand
a great deal of it.

170
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,494
Wasn't what I expected
in some places.

171
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,707
I've slept in a good bed
for a great, long while.

172
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,337
Now they've seen fit
to put me out of here.

173
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,965
They say they're setting me free today.

174
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,137
I reckon that's all you was
needing to know.

175
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,935
You want more details.
I reckon I can tell them.

176
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,188
I don't know whether that's enough
for your newspaper or not.

177
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,692
Will you ever kill again, Karl?

178
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,331
I don't reckon I got no reason
to kill nobody.

179
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,678
- Where will he go?
- Anywhere he wants.

180
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,515
I think he's going to Millsburg where
he's from, about 20 miles from here.

181
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:17,686
- Will he be supervised?
- As much as anybody, I guess.

182
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,813
Y'all have a nice day, now.

183
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,483
I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.

184
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,490
Would you walk these girls out?

185
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,578
Thank you.

186
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:51,011
I reckon I'll have to get used to
looking at pretty people.

187
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,013
Guess you will.

188
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,184
Reckon I'll have to get used to them
looking at me too.

189
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,064
Better go get your things.

190
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,066
Ain't got nothing but them books.

191
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,070
Better go get them.

192
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,031
All right, then.

193
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,087
All right, then.

194
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,401
Can I help you?

195
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,287
I was kinda wanting
something to eat.

196
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,414
Well, what would you like?

197
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,210
You got any biscuits in there?

198
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,547
No, this is a Frosty Cream.
We don't serve biscuits.

199
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,591
We got a lot of other stuff.

200
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,302
What you got in there
that's good to eat?

201
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,888
We got Big Chief Burgers,
Bongo Burgers...

202
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,516
Foot-longs, Corny Dogs,
Frosty Shakes, Creamy Bars.

203
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,686
Did you want me to go through
the whole list?

204
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,981
What do you like?

205
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:37,738
Well, the french fries are pretty good.

206
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,617
- French fried potatoes?
- Yep, french fries.

207
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,288
How much you want for them?

208
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,791
They're 60 for medium
and 75 for large.

209
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,048
I reckon I'll have me
some of the big ones.

210
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,300
All right.
One large french fries?

211
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,718
These darn things are heavy.

212
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,388
Hard to carry too.

213
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,015
- You got wash in there?
- Yeah.

214
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,895
Can't your mama and daddy tend to it?

215
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:56,441
I got a mama but she's at work
at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

216
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,112
My daddy's dead.
He got hit by a train.

217
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,450
How far you going
with them sacks full of wash?

218
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,452
Half a mile, I think.

219
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,082
I can help you tote it
if I don't give out first.

220
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,501
Okay, but you don't have to.

221
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,797
All right, then.

222
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,887
My name's Frank Wheatley.
What's yours?

223
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,306
Karl's my name.

224
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,391
- What's your last name?
- Childers.

225
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,812
What are all them books?

226
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,814
Oh, different ones.

227
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,317
One's the Bible, one's a book
on Christmas...

228
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,903
one's on how to be a carpenter.

229
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:45,282
- Why do you carry them around?
- Ain't got no place to set them down.

230
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,492
Don't you live somewhere?

231
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,370
Did live at the state hospital.

232
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:54,541
- Why?
- I killed some folks a while back.

233
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,878
They said I wasn't right in the head so
they put me in the nervous hospital...

234
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,380
instead of putting me in jail.

235
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:03,050
- They let you out?
- Yeah.

236
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,720
- How come?
- They told me I was well.

237
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,806
Had to turn me loose.

238
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,185
- Are you well?
- I reckon I feel all right.

239
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,065
This here's my house.

240
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,738
You don't seem like you killed nobody.

241
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,199
We can just
set these bags on the porch.

242
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,201
All right, then.

243
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,719
You like to play football?

244
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,265
I never was no account at it,
never got picked out for it.

245
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,685
Me and the Barnett twins
and some boys...

246
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,896
play at the junior high school field
all the time.

247
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,191
You want to play, come on over
'cause we ain't no good either.

248
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,278
I'll see you later.

249
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,280
All right, then.

250
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,545
Hon, you can't just go in there.

251
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,299
What in the world are you doing here?

252
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,301
I want to come back and stay in here.

253
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,180
You can't. You're a free man.

254
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:16,183
They let you out so you can
do as you please.

255
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,894
I reckon I don't care
about being a free man.

256
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,522
I don't know how
to go about it.

257
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,482
You'll have to learn.

258
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,817
It'll take some time.

259
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,695
Don't you have anybody
to help you out?

260
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,906
No, sir.

261
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,493
Your daddy was living there
last time I heard.

262
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:38,997
I guess he wouldn't want to
help you out any, would he?

263
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,251
Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

264
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,506
Don't you have anybody?

265
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,594
No, sir. Never did know
too much of nobody down there.

266
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,013
Not to be helping me out,
no way.

267
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,893
Karl, the truth is...

268
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,898
I don't know where they expect you
to go, what they expect you to do.

269
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:09,611
If I could, I'd let you come back here
and stay if you wanted to.

270
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,447
I'm just doing my job.

271
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,449
You follow me?

272
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,581
Listen, Karl, I know an old boy...

273
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:24,084
who's got a fix-it shop deal
in Millsburg.

274
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,086
He used to go to church with me.

275
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:31,008
You're good working on
small engines and things.

276
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:35,304
If I was to put my neck out
for you with him...

277
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:38,182
do you think you could work it
if he'll hire you?

278
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:44,313
I'm pretty handy, I reckon,
on lawn mowers and whatnot.

279
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:47,399
I know you are.
I've seen it myself.

280
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,110
- Could you give it a try?
- I reckon.

281
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,282
Now I can't promise
that he'll hire you.

282
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,618
I'll have to tell him
about your history.

283
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,372
I never was no good with history.

284
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,000
No. I mean your past.

285
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,880
Why you were in here.

286
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,717
Take you down first thing
in the morning.

287
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,679
You don't have
anywhere to stay tonight at all?

288
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:19,848
No, sir.

289
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,309
It's against the rules
for you to stay here.

290
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,395
If something happened,
I'd be liable.

291
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,819
I reckon I can walk around till
morning time, sit and read a book.

292
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,007
Karl, would you like
a muffin?

293
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,009
No, thank you.

294
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:03,183
So Jerry's taking you
someplace else tomorrow.

295
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,187
I don't know nobody named Jerry.

296
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,440
That's me, Karl. That's my first name.

297
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,695
He's carrying me to look for work
down in Millsburg...

298
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,697
where I was born.

299
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,159
Would you like some coffee?

300
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:25,414
Coffee makes me a mite nervous
when I drink it.

301
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,875
Daddy, can I go to bed?

302
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,003
Sure. You sleep
with your mama tonight.

303
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,964
I'm sleeping with your brother
so Karl can have your room.

304
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,591
Why?

305
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,969
Because he's company.

306
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,775
- Karl, you up?
- Yes, sir.

307
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,865
Didn't you sleep?

308
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,701
You been sitting there
like that all night?

309
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,828
Yes, sir.

310
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,997
Come on. We'd better hit the road.

311
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,459
All right, then.

312
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,264
Jerry, how's it going?

313
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,683
- Hey, Bill.
- Good to see you.

314
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:11,228
- Good to see you. How's everyone doing?
- Pretty good.

315
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:14,106
Kids are driving me crazy, and Phyliss
is putting me in the poor house...

316
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,899
but I can't complain otherwise.

317
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,902
Wouldn't do any good anyway.
You know Scooter?

318
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,113
Don't believe I do.
Good to meet you, Scooter.

319
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,448
How about you?

320
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,909
Well, this is the one I was
telling you about on the phone.

321
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:29,997
If you get nervous, I'll understand,
but I'm not going to lie to you.

322
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,207
He got into that trouble,
but he was young.

323
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,712
I remember. He cut them
to pieces, and one was his mama.

324
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,714
And that Dixon boy.

325
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:42,718
Hell, I always wanted to kill him.
He was an asshole.

326
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,803
I remember him too.

327
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:48,098
Kinda retarded or something
back in school.

328
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:52,311
Seems like he's pretty
well-adjusted these days.

329
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,688
I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.

330
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,860
He don't look much like he would.
And he can fix a small engine real good?

331
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,654
He's a whiz. It's all he's done
since he was a kid.

332
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,909
- You scared of him, Scooter?
- No, I don't guess so.

333
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,077
- Can he talk?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,830
You say he can stay
out in the back?

335
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,874
Fine with me. If he steals anything...

336
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,001
I'll take it out of your pocket.

337
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,713
He won't steal. He's a good old boy.
Keeps to himself.

338
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,883
I got a room full of work.
Scooter won't do it.

339
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,345
Karl, come over here.

340
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,680
I want you to meet your new boss.

341
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,558
This is Bill Cox.
He runs the place.

342
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,394
Says you can work here,
stay out back.

343
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,856
- It's good to know you, Karl.
- Thank you.

344
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:42,694
It's minimum wage. There's nothing back
there but an army cot and a toilet.

345
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,073
That's fine. I'll go to the car
and get your books.

346
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,075
All right, then.

347
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,206
They say you're a whiz on fixing
lawn mowers and things.

348
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,670
I've tinkered around
on them a bit.

349
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,923
We order from the Frosty Cream
at lunch, usually.

350
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,342
We'll buy you lunch
till you get on your feet.

351
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,012
I like them
french fried potatoes.

352
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,016
Yeah. Me too.

353
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:18,021
They make a good double meat burger.

354
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,787
All right, then.
I'll see y'all later.

355
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:37,291
Karl, you done good work.
They was right about you.

356
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,878
Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of
a job if you're not careful.

357
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,213
- I'll see y'all tomorrow.
- Wait up.

358
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,215
I'll leave with you and lock up.

359
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:51,805
There's a blanket under the cot, soap
in the bathroom for cleaning up.

360
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:55,893
One more thing. The way we lock
these doors, you can't get out at night.

361
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,563
- Did you want to go anywhere?
- I don't reckon.

362
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,483
If it works out, we'll get you a key so
you can get out at night.

363
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,694
- I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

364
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:32,763
Did I tell you the one about the two
old boys pissing off the bridge?

365
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,348
I don't remember.

366
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:39,394
These two old boys hung their peckers
off a bridge to piss.

367
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,898
One was from California,
one from Arkansas.

368
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,068
Old boy from California says,
"Boy, this water's cold."

369
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,862
Old boy from Arkansas says,
"Yeah, and it's deep too."

370
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,159
Get it?

371
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:57,704
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- That is a good one.

372
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:02,167
I do believe you told me that before.
I've heard it a bunch.

373
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:06,463
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, that's a classic.

374
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:12,010
Karl, I've been thinking, and it's not
Christian of me to keep locking you in.

375
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,763
You've been in lockup so long,
you don't need me to keep doing it.

376
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:17,391
You need to come and go as you please.
Here.

377
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,979
Take this key. It'll get you
in and out of here at night.

378
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,775
All right, then.

379
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,447
- Them french fries good?
- They's good, all right.

380
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,577
You got any money?

381
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:40,289
They give me some
when they turned me loose.

382
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,919
I spent some riding the bus,
eating french fried potatoes.

383
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,383
I'm going to pay you today
for this coming week...

384
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,969
so you have some walking-around money.

385
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:58,974
You need to buy some toothpaste and
cleaning up supplies to have back there.

386
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,477
Get you some magazines
and some hard candy...

387
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:06,273
something to keep you busy
at night.

388
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,233
All right, then.

389
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,694
I'll let you off
while it's still daylight.

390
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:47,648
I thought I heard somebody on the porch.
Wasn't your name Karl?

391
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,653
Yes, sir, it is.
You're named Frank.

392
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,823
Yeah. What are you doing by here?

393
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:00,536
- You said for me to come by.
- Wanna play ball with us?

394
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:05,749
I ain't no good at it.
I just come by to see you.

395
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:10,671
I was going to see my mama at Hoochy's
Dollar Store. She works 2:00 to 8:00.

396
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:14,007
All right, then.

397
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,593
You want to go with me?
You can meet my mama.

398
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,265
I ought not worry your mama
with company.

399
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:25,269
Come on. You'll like her.
She's real nice.

400
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:29,147
She'll give us anything we want her to,
candy or something.

401
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,902
I was needing to do some trading.

402
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:36,113
Reckon they sell toothpaste?

403
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,366
Yeah, they sell a little bit
of everything.

404
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:43,453
I won't tell her about you being in
the state hospital for killing.

405
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,497
Come on. Let's go.

406
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,599
You have to learn to live
without all that grease.

407
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,894
Here in the South,
I like grease in everything.

408
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,606
I like fried chicken, fried okra,
biscuits and gravy.

409
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,566
- It will kill you.
- Hey, Mama, Vaughan.

410
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,027
- What you up to, sweetheart?
- I bet I know.

411
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,821
- You want candy and pop, right?
- Yeah.

412
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:21,200
That rots your teeth.
I've got something better.

413
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,702
Potted meat is on special--
four cans for a dollar.

414
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:29,374
They're not selling but I'll give
the right kid some for free.

415
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,335
I don't like potted meat.

416
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:34,796
Daddy said it was made from lips,
peckers and intestines.

417
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,051
Don't talk that way. Did that
strange-looking man follow you in here?

418
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,262
Can I help you?

419
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,558
That's Karl. I met him
at the laundry mat.

420
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,353
Karl, this is Mama and Vaughan.

421
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,522
Vaughan is the manager.

422
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:55,776
He lets Mama off work anytime
because they're best friends.

423
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,819
Nice to meet you, Karl.

424
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,323
Pleased to meet you.

425
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,913
Frank, come back here with me
for a minute.

426
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,712
I haven't seen you here before.

427
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:21,093
No, sir, I don't reckon you have.
I haven't been in here before.

428
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:24,721
This store didn't used to be here.

429
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:29,226
It's been here 17 years.
Did you live here before?

430
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:32,104
I was born and raised here till
I was 12 years old.

431
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:36,775
- What brings you back?
- What's that you say?

432
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:41,905
Why are you here now?

433
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,783
They turned me loose from
the state hospital.

434
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:49,454
Is that right?
How long are you staying?

435
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:54,126
Mr. Woolridge got me hired
at Bill Cox's outfit.

436
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,213
- You have family here?
- Not to speak of.

437
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:02,926
Hey, Karl. Guess what?
Mama said you can stay in our garage.

438
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,096
Our car doesn't fit anyway.
It's real neat.

439
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,808
Frank told me about your situation.
Frank loves company.

440
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,311
Especially after his daddy passed
and all.

441
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,898
There's no sense in you staying
in that greasy old shop.

442
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,192
He's mentally retarded,
poor thing.

443
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,111
- He just go out of the state hospital.
- I know.

444
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,822
- Can we get some candy and pop?
- Sure. Go ahead.

445
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,782
Come on.

446
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:31,205
- Is it safe to let him around that guy?
- Frank's crazy about him.

447
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:35,209
He likes the way he talks and he helped
Frank carry home the laundry.

448
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,629
He's been in the hospital a long time.
There must be something wrong with him.

449
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:41,798
He's retarded. Frank's always after
a father figure.

450
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,218
Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
with his mean ass.

451
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:47,971
- What about me?
- He doesn't see you as a "guy" guy.

452
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,057
Karl's a "guy" guy?

453
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,203
I call this my secret place.

454
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,665
I come out here when I feel like
being alone.

455
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,750
I used to come here with Karen Cross.

456
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:20,754
She kind of used to be my girlfriend.

457
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,757
We would come out here
and hold hands and talk...

458
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:27,261
and read books to each other
with a flashlight.

459
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,222
She wouldn't have nothing to do with me
in front of other people...

460
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:34,268
because Mama and I
don't have any money.

461
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,271
Her daddy's a dentist,
so they're rich.

462
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,607
Was your folks well off?

463
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:45,279
No, we barely had enough
to scrape by on, I reckon.

464
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:48,282
Your folks still around?

465
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,325
My mother's dead.

466
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:54,913
My daddy's still around but he don't
want to have nothing to do with me.

467
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:58,709
- How do you know?
- He never did want to.

468
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:02,629
I figure he probably
ain't changed his mind much.

469
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,590
How'd your mama die?

470
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,469
You don't need to hear
things like that.

471
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,555
You just a boy.

472
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:14,766
You need to think good thoughts
while you still a boy.

473
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,103
There's lots of time for all the other.

474
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,898
I had bad thoughts since Daddy died.

475
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:25,319
Sometimes I wish I was still little
and he was still here.

476
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,197
Mama's real good, but I wish
I had both of them.

477
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,824
We went to Memphis in the car once.

478
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,493
It was raining so hard
we couldn't see the road...

479
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,330
but I wasn't scared because
as long as Daddy was driving...

480
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,373
nothing could happen to us.

481
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,626
That's the way I feel about Mama now.

482
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,380
Mama has a boyfriend now.

483
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:48,383
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

484
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:51,220
He works construction so he makes
a pretty good living...

485
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:54,056
but he don't help Mama out
with any money.

486
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:58,519
He ain't no good. He's mean to her.
He don't like me at all.

487
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,065
Mama says he's jealous
because I belong to my daddy.

488
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:08,070
He spends the night at our house
and he's got his own house.

489
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:11,490
Somebody told me this way
he can have more girlfriends.

490
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:15,202
I like the nights he's not there.
I ain't so nervous then.

491
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,417
How come she's still being girlfriends
with him if he's mean to her?

492
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,254
She says it's for the times
he's good to her.

493
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,256
She's lonely since Daddy died.

494
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,925
Sometimes she don't know why.

495
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:32,511
He threatened to kill her
if she left him.

496
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:37,266
My daddy would kill him if he was here
and somebody was mean to Mama.

497
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,393
Vaughan's real good to Mama.

498
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,395
Vaughan that you met?

499
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,773
But he's not able to do anything
to Doyle. He's funny.

500
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,025
Not "funny," ha-ha.
"Funny," queer.

501
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:49,194
He likes to go with men.

502
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:54,116
That makes him not able to fight good,
but he sure is nice.

503
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:58,453
He's from St. Louis. Queer people
get along better in a big town.

504
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,998
I wish he like to go with women.

505
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:04,084
I'd rather him be Mama's boyfriend
than Doyle.

506
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:10,007
Karl, remember I told you Daddy
got hit by a train?

507
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,092
Yes, sir, I recollect that.

508
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,222
It ain't the truth. He shot himself
with a shotgun on purpose.

509
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,601
How come him do that?

510
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:26,106
Because he didn't have enough money
to take care of us like he wanted to.

511
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,108
That's what the letter said.

512
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:31,820
He got laid off of work
and did odd jobs.

513
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:34,198
I thought he took care of us
just fine.

514
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:43,707
Karl, did you really kill somebody?

515
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,375
Yes, sir, I did.

516
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,378
- Who'd you kill?
- Two people.

517
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:51,507
- Were they bad people?
- I thought they was.

518
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:55,219
Maybe they needed it.

519
00:43:56,303 --> 00:44:01,808
I growed up and learned that you ain't
supposed to kill nobody.

520
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:05,896
It's okay if you're protecting yourself,
if it's self-defense.

521
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,315
Was it self-defense?

522
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,529
My daddy was good.

523
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:16,073
I think too many good people die.

524
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:18,033
That's what I think.

525
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,392
You sure you wanna
stay with these folks?

526
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:47,396
You're welcome to stay here.
It's working out good.

527
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:50,274
That boy wants me to.

528
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:53,235
All right, then.
I'll see you bright and early.

529
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:55,404
How's that garden tiller coming?

530
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,198
I fixed it.
It's working pretty good now.

531
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,784
You done fixed it?
I'll be damned.

532
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,870
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.

533
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,623
Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless
as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.

534
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:10,419
You done fixed it.
Well, I'll just be damned.

535
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,297
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, then.

536
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:25,517
I don't guess I'll give a shit, then.
I ain't here that much.

537
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:29,313
If you want a retard living
in your garage, that's your business.

538
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:32,691
I do got some tools
I'd rather not have stoled.

539
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,818
I could take those home with me.

540
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,029
He's real honest.
He wouldn't steal nothing.

541
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:40,991
Frankie, I wasn't talking to you,
was l?

542
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,202
- No, sir.
- "No, sir" is right.

543
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:46,705
I was talking to your mama.
It's her decision, not yours.

544
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,625
If I let it go on,
it's because she asked me, not you.

545
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:57,216
Does this retard drool
and rub shit in his hair and all that?

546
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,511
I'm going to have a hard time eating
around that kind of thing.

547
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,013
Just like with antique furniture
and midgets.

548
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:07,518
I can't so much as drink a glass of
water around a midget or an antique.

549
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,020
Doyle, you're awful.
You shouldn't be that way.

550
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:15,567
I ain't saying it's right. It's just
the truth. He'll make me sick.

551
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:19,905
- What was he in the nut house for?
- He's just retarded, I guess.

552
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,201
No, he had of gone nuts
and did something.

553
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:27,579
A lot of retards running around that
ain't locked up in the nut house.

554
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,082
Think about it, Linda.

555
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,209
You know what he done, Frank?

556
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,420
- I ain't sure.
- You oughta want to find out.

557
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,423
He might have hacked his family
to pieces with a hatchet or something.

558
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,425
Frank, you'd better ask him.

559
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:43,762
Don't hurt his feelings,
but it would be good to know.

560
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,014
I'm sure it's nothing.
He seems sweet.

561
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:50,269
You're all hung up
on people being sweet.

562
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:54,273
He's sweet. Everybody's sweet. Speaking
of sweet, where's your girlfriend?

563
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:57,276
- I thought he was coming over.
- He'll be here in a while.

564
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:01,196
- We're going for ice cream.
- Now ain't that sweet.

565
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,199
What do I do about supper while you're
running around with that fag?

566
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,994
You're not crippled.
Go make something.

567
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,621
Talking back and everything,
aren't you?

568
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,832
That makes me horny.

569
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:15,711
Frank, go and play in your room,
if Doyle's going to talk nasty.

570
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:19,923
- I don't want to go play.
- He don't want to. Let him stay.

571
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:25,929
Let's be a family till your mentally
retarded and homosexual friends arrive.

572
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,904
Yes, sir?

573
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:45,824
You're really going to stay here.

574
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:49,119
That boy wants me to.

575
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,121
Have you knocked yet?

576
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,375
- No, sir, I ain't.
- How long have you been here?

577
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,506
Quite a spell, I reckon.

578
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:05,302
Before you get used to staying here,
we need to talk about a few things.

579
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,721
Can I take you to lunch?

580
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,015
I done ate a little bit ago.

581
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,726
I mean tomorrow
or the next day.

582
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,023
I reckon I could eat something
at noontime.

583
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,528
Bill Cox generally gets me
a box lunch...

584
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:26,406
but I reckon he can
lay off doing it tomorrow.

585
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:31,328
Then I'll come by and
pick you up around noon, all right?

586
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,413
All right, then.

587
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,211
There's your girlfriend.

588
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,717
Y'all come on in.

589
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,513
Come on. Have a seat in here.

590
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,102
- Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
- Tolerable, I reckon.

591
00:48:55,227 --> 00:49:00,774
Karl, this is Doyle. Frank, you and Karl
go fix him up a place in the garage.

592
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,026
- Vaughan, you ready to go?
- Sure.

593
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,028
Honey, don't rush everybody off.

594
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:08,615
- You and Karl want to go with us?
- I don't want to.

595
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,034
We got things we need to do.

596
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,328
Vaughan, you know what I heard?

597
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:16,707
That you been putting it on Albert
Sellers over at the funeral home.

598
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:20,919
- I know Albert. We're friends.
- I heard you was more than friends.

599
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:25,632
I heard Dick Rivers caught you two
going at it in the same room...

600
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:29,303
with poor old Mrs. Ogletree and her dead
as a doornail laid out on a gurney.

601
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:32,598
- That's ridiculous, a total lie.
- Let's go, Vaughan.

602
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:35,100
We'll be back in a while.
I'll bring you something.

603
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:40,105
- Your food's in the oven warming over.
- You fixed him something.

604
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:45,027
Vaughan, I was just going on with you.
Just joking around. You know, buddy.

605
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,529
I know. You're a real card.

606
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,203
Karl, come over,
sit down and talk to me.

607
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,507
Come on, Karl.
Let's go to the garage.

608
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,134
Goddammit. I want to talk to him.

609
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,220
Sit down, Karl.

610
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,019
What's in your bag?

611
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,235
This and that.
Toothpaste and whatnot.

612
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:32,199
- What's all them books?
- Different ones.

613
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,577
One of them's the Bible.

614
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,913
You believe in the Bible,
Karl?

615
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,583
Yes, sir. A good deal of it.

616
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,211
I can't understand all of it.

617
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:48,257
I can't understand none of it.

618
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:51,093
This one begat that one,
that one begat this one...

619
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:56,014
and begat and begat and lo and behold
someone says some shit to someone.

620
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:58,600
- How retarded are you?
- Stop it, Doyle.

621
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,230
Frankie, be quiet. We're talking.
The adults are talking.

622
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:09,111
Was you in lockup for cutting someone
with a hatchet or something?

623
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:15,409
I ain't never used no hatchet
that I remember.

624
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,620
So you're just crazy
in a retard kind of way then?

625
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,500
It wouldn't matter to me
if you did do violence.

626
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,211
I ain't scared of shit.

627
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,423
You think I'm scared
for you to stay here?

628
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,217
You just a humped-over retard.

629
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:42,811
I'm just kidding you.
Welcome to our humble home, buddy.

630
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,606
Frank needs
all the friends he can get.

631
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:48,817
Frank's a weak little kid.

632
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:51,195
His daddy taught him
how to be a pussy.

633
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,405
Don't talk about my daddy.

634
00:51:56,867 --> 00:52:00,204
Go on out to the garage.
Leave me be.

635
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,831
Go on.

636
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:04,833
Come on, Karl.

637
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:20,891
Don't say nothing
about our little spat to your mama.

638
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,893
I don't want her worrying.

639
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:30,567
I'd like to kill that son-of-a-bitch.
I hate him.

640
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:35,572
You ought not talk that away.
You just a boy.

641
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,699
Well, I hate him.

642
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:40,577
He ought not talk that away
to you neither.

643
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,914
He ain't no account. He's mean
to you and your mama.

644
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,336
Your mama and that fellow that's
carrying me to get something to eat's...

645
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,089
going to be back directly.

646
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,259
Will you be here with us
for a long time?

647
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,511
I reckon,
if you want me to.

648
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:04,601
I got some of that potted meat
and soda crackers if you want some.

649
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:09,606
How can you eat all that stuff
with them insides it's made out of?

650
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:12,025
I reckon it tastes
pretty good to me.

651
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,697
I like the way you talk.

652
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,324
Well, I like the way you talk.

653
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:25,414
You think it's really got
peckers in there?

654
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:28,333
You know better than to say that word.

655
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,130
It smells kinda funny.

656
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,133
It's a little loud.
Looky right here.

657
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,136
I believe you right.
I believe I see one in there.

658
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,020
Thank you, sir.

659
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,496
Mister, could you hand me
that mustard over there?

660
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,709
Thank you.

661
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,008
Okay, Karl.
The reason that l...

662
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,302
brought you here is...

663
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:23,222
to talk about something
that's on my mind.

664
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:26,517
I'm just going to put it
right out on the table.

665
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,728
Where do I start?

666
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:35,734
Linda and Frank are
very important to me.

667
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,903
They're like family.

668
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:41,323
My own family was never like a family.

669
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:45,577
They're horrible people.
As a matter of fact...

670
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:50,332
for years I prayed every night
that my father would die...

671
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,210
and finally realized,
through a lot of therapy...

672
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,756
I was wasting my energy
on hating him.

673
00:54:57,923 --> 00:55:01,593
So now I just don't care.

674
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:05,264
But you see, you and I
are a lot alike...

675
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,266
as strange as that may seem.

676
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:12,604
I don't mean physically
or even mentally, really...

677
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,898
but emotionally.

678
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:19,611
Actually, the hand
we've been dealt in life--

679
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:25,701
We're different. People see us
as being different, anyway.

680
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:29,037
You're--
You've got...

681
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,416
your affliction or whatever and l--

682
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,918
Well, mine's not as easy to see.

683
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm just going to say it.

684
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,632
I'm gay.

685
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:44,803
Does that surprise you?

686
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,805
That I'm gay?

687
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:53,312
- You know what "gay" is, don't you?
- I don't reckon.

688
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,901
Homosexual.

689
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:02,112
I like men. Sexually.

690
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:06,825
Not "funny," ha-ha.
"Funny," queer.

691
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:12,372
That's an offensive way
to put it.

692
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,499
You shouldn't say that.

693
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,503
You were taught that,
weren't you?

694
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:20,380
I've heard it said that away,
yes, sir.

695
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,302
Anyway, it's hard to live gay--
that's the right way to say it--

696
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,304
in a small town like this.

697
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:31,058
I've wanted to leave many times, but...

698
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,310
because I love...

699
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:37,231
Linda, Frank and...

700
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,025
a certain other person--

701
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,819
They've kept me here.
Anyway, I'm rambling.

702
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,407
If you're going to live
in the Wheatley garage...

703
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:50,035
you need to know it's
not going to be easy.

704
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:52,704
Doyle is a monster.

705
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:58,210
Not just a closed-minded redneck,
but a monster, a dangerous person.

706
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:04,091
I've told Linda that one day that man
is going to hurt her and that boy...

707
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:06,510
maybe even kill them.

708
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:10,222
I see it in his eyes.
I'm very in tune, even psychic.

709
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,766
But Doyle is going to
make your life hell.

710
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:21,733
There's one more thing.

711
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:26,238
It's none of my business why you were
in the state hospital.

712
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,700
Everybody has something
in their past.

713
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,827
Maybe...

714
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:34,413
you tried suicide.

715
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:38,208
Maybe you did something terrible.

716
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:41,420
But what I see before me...

717
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,298
is a gentle...

718
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:47,426
simple man.

719
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:51,513
All I want you to promise me...

720
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:55,309
is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda.

721
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,936
You know. You would never...

722
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,815
hurt either of them
for any reason, would you?

723
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,527
I would never hurt them.

724
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:12,117
That's what I thought. I'm sorry
if I've offended you in any way.

725
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:16,371
You seem like a thinker, you know.

726
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:20,626
You seem to always be deep in thought.

727
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:23,128
What are you thinking right now?

728
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:33,514
I was thinking I might wanna take some
of these potatoes home with me.

729
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,726
How about before that?

730
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,236
Let me think.

731
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:51,323
Before that, I was thinking...

732
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,535
I could use me six or eight cans
of that potted meat...

733
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:56,912
if you got any extra.

734
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,383
Frankie, get some of this salad.

735
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,220
Hold your plate up for me.

736
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:19,059
I'm just gonna reach.
How come Karl won't eat in here with us?

737
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,396
I don't know.
He said he'd eat out there.

738
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:25,232
I wouldn't let it get to you.
Put some dressing on there.

739
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:28,652
- Yes.
- I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

740
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:34,950
Who the hell could eat with him making
all that racket in his throat?

741
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,327
He does make some funny noises.

742
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,329
I like the way he talks.

743
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:43,250
Sounds like a race car motor idling.
Makes me not be nervous.

744
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,335
I'm glad of it.

745
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,630
What have you got to be nervous about?
You're a kid.

746
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:51,925
You got no bills to pay,
no business to run.

747
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,763
You don't even have to have a job.
You got no old lady on your ass at all.

748
00:59:56,847 --> 01:00:00,058
I don't know.
I just stay nervous.

749
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:03,937
Could I have some of that ham?

750
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,939
Yeah. I'm sorry.

751
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,944
Thank you.

752
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:33,634
- You know what, by God?
- What?

753
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:35,636
I know what I ought to do tonight.

754
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,597
Please, don't.

755
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:42,518
I'm gonna call up Morris
and get the band together.

756
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:45,020
We're gonna party our asses off.

757
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:49,358
I'd love to show them Karl.
They'd get a kick out of him.

758
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,860
Not tonight.
I'm not up for it.

759
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:55,155
They always stay till morning.
I'll just give out.

760
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:57,699
You don't gotta do nothing.
Just put chips in a bowl...

761
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:00,536
and run ice out to us
when we get low.

762
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:04,957
Last time, you got mad and run Morris
and them off and told them to stay away.

763
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:09,336
That ain't none of your business.
Besides, that's the way friends are.

764
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,883
Fuck. I'm calling them up.

765
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,723
Linda, go into the garage
and get my guitar.

766
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,101
It's out there with that looney toon.

767
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:26,228
Now?

768
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,730
Yeah, now.
I'm calling them up.

769
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:33,026
Morris, what you doing, boy?

770
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,654
Where's Randy and them?

771
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:39,658
Yeah, now. Please.
Frankie, go help your mom.

772
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,660
- When are we gonna eat?
- Hang on.

773
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:43,662
Eat when you come back.
Get my guitar.

774
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:45,789
Come on, sugar.

775
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,916
I wanna get together.

776
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,751
Yeah.

777
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:52,212
Call him.

778
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:55,424
One. Two. One, two, three, four.

779
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:41,261
You gotta play through it. Wail on the
gig, but you gotta play through it.

780
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,347
- No, you play through--
- You like that, Vaughan?

781
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:46,892
Sure. It sounds like
a number one hit tune.

782
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:50,145
Karl, did you like that?

783
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,983
- I reckon.
- I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!

784
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:58,362
- I can't think with that racket!
- Hey!

785
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:01,657
- It's nighttime.
- Hey!

786
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:04,660
- I'm calling the police!
- I told you already!

787
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,703
The law's on my side!

788
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:11,792
I play cards with J.D. Shelnut,
chief of police!

789
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:15,128
So kiss my ass, you old bastard!

790
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,134
You and Frank clean this mess up.
Put the tarp over these instruments.

791
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:24,638
Me and the boys are going to
the county line. We're out of liquor.

792
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:27,724
Karl, come with us.
Vaughan, come on.

793
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:31,144
It's late.
I have to work tomorrow.

794
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:34,064
Don't be a pussy.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

795
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,858
- Come on.
- He don't want to.

796
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:39,862
Don't go if you don't want to.
You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.

797
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:44,533
I ain't gonna wreck.
I'll be good. I promise.

798
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,660
I love you, sweetie.

799
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:49,705
Come on, Karl. Go with us.

800
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:53,417
Just trying to make these two
feel like they're part of it.

801
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,210
Come on, Vaughan.
This'll be fun.

802
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,005
Karl, let's go.
Come on.

803
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:09,766
- You gotta lay out on that tambourine.
- I ain't did nothing wrong.

804
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,529
Hey! Ain't anybody gonna come get me?

805
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:26,700
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

806
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:31,205
- Exactly the point, my young friend.
- I don't get it.

807
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:33,916
I rest my case.

808
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:37,002
Morris is real smart
with philosophies and things.

809
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,339
That's why him and me is the
songwriting team of our group.

810
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:44,968
I come up with the good tunes,
or melodies, as we call them...

811
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,929
Morris is the lyrics.

812
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:49,765
Not unlike Gary Brooker
of Procol Harum.

813
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:53,310
We don't ever played songs
y'all wrote. I ain't heard one of them.

814
01:04:53,352 --> 01:04:54,645
Y'all just talk.

815
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:58,315
We don't play any songs
with words at all.

816
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:03,153
We ain't got no fucking microphone!
We ain't got no speakers!

817
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:05,447
We wrote one last night
outside the mini-mart.

818
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:09,868
Morris called it, "Stuart Drives
a Comfortable Car."

819
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:15,332
Then, like in country songs,
in parenthesis it says...

820
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:18,544
"There's usually someone in the trunk."

821
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:21,672
And I came up with a tune,
just humming.

822
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,050
You don't wanna question
a genius, Vaughan.

823
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:27,845
Morris here's a modern-day poet.

824
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:30,013
Kind of like in the olden times.

825
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:35,727
Yeah, I got a new tune. This
composition's entitled, "The Thrill."

826
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:37,563
Goes something like this:

827
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:42,401
I stand on the hill,
not for a thrill...

828
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:45,529
but for a breath of a fresh kill.

829
01:05:45,654 --> 01:05:48,949
Never mind the man who contemplates...

830
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,869
doing away with license plates.

831
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:54,705
He stands alone anyhow...

832
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:58,000
baking the cookies of discontent...

833
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,086
by the heat of the laundromat vent.

834
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,922
Leaving his soul.

835
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:07,843
Then, like in poetry,
I go dot, dot, dot.

836
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:11,138
You know, kind of off-center,
then I drop down...

837
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:13,932
and then I go: Leaving his soul...

838
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:18,353
parting the waters
of the medulla oblongata...

839
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:19,855
of...

840
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:23,859
mankind.

841
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:26,320
Damn good song, wasn't it?
You like that song?

842
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,239
All right.

843
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:31,241
I don't think that's right.

844
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:33,994
I believe the "dot, dot, dot"
come between...

845
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:36,246
"medulla" and "oblongata."

846
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,169
Well, it did.

847
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,463
The dots are where I say they are.

848
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:47,841
Melody and tune.
That's your trade, Terence.

849
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:50,093
You're a tunesmith.

850
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,346
I don't understand the words.

851
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:55,641
Y'all don't shut up,
I'm gonna go out of my mind.

852
01:06:55,641 --> 01:07:00,312
Besides, Karl's liable to bust his
spring. He's already off balance.

853
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,482
That wasn't the way you made
it up before. That's all I know.

854
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:08,445
We don't need no fancy words.
We need to practice, to rehearse.

855
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:11,865
I'll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

856
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:16,537
We don't need this messing around.
That's ridiculous.

857
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,205
Amen, Johnson.

858
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:23,460
We don't got no goddamn band!

859
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:26,588
We don't need to fucking practice!

860
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:30,968
We don't need a shit-ass manager
neither!

861
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:35,055
You motherfuckers!
You're all just a bunch of losers!

862
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,641
I'm the only sane son-of-a-bitch here!

863
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,726
Get the fuck out of my house!

864
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:42,145
It's not your house.
It's Linda's.

865
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,857
I'll whip the dog shit out of you.

866
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:48,110
I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again!

867
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:52,614
All of you get the fuck out
before I get too mad to turn back!

868
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,951
What about our instruments?

869
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:58,662
Come here, you little prick!

870
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:02,124
Come here, you little fucking prick!

871
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,919
Get out!
All y'all!

872
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:08,005
Get the fuck out!

873
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:10,048
Come on, you motherfuckers!

874
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,970
Get the fuck out!

875
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:17,389
Randy, you tuning son-of-a-bitch!

876
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:21,059
Go fucking practice!

877
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:27,149
Come on, Morris. You fucking genius.
Get the fuck up...

878
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:30,068
and get the fuck out of here,
goddammit!

879
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:34,281
This ain't right, Doyle.

880
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:38,118
- There's something wrong with you.
- Get out!

881
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,454
Nobody wants to take this shit.

882
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:53,467
Dots look good on paper.
You don't sing them anyway.

883
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:58,722
- You're just showing your true colors.
- Stay out of my face, you buzzard!

884
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:09,608
Hey! I said get out of my house!

885
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,486
That goes for cocksuckers and retards!

886
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,363
Get up off your asses and go!

887
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:17,199
This is not your house.
This is my house.

888
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,368
I'll say who stays and goes.

889
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:23,413
You got a house.
Why don't you go home to it?

890
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,667
You know better to talk like
that when I'm hurting.

891
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,710
Don't make me knock the piss out of you.

892
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,296
Don't you touch her.

893
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,841
That's funny, Vaughan.

894
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:37,553
Linda, go to bed.
And take little snot-nose here with you.

895
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:39,847
You're not staying here tonight.

896
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:43,892
Get sober before you come back.
I'm tired of my child seeing this.

897
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:49,064
Get your ass straight or I'll lock
your ass out of my life for good.

898
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:53,235
If you even think about leaving me,
I told you...

899
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,571
I'm gonna kill you deader than
a doornail.

900
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:58,490
- That might be better than this.
- I'm a witness to you threatening her.

901
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:00,659
You get the fuck out now!

902
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:02,411
Leave!

903
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:06,874
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Leave!

904
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,008
- Don't do that!
- I'm calling the police!

905
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:20,053
- Goddamn you, little prick!
- Don't touch my mama!

906
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:23,098
Don't touch her!
Go home!

907
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:25,809
- Get away from here!
- Jesus!

908
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,395
Hey! Goddamn you!

909
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,439
Get away from us!

910
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,945
Get away from us!

911
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:41,325
All right.
Okay.

912
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,827
I'm gonna leave now.
Fuck me.

913
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,959
I'm gonna go home and sober up.

914
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,756
Go on, then.

915
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:58,926
Everything's bothering me.
I'm hurting, Linda.

916
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,055
- I love you.
- Well, I hate you!

917
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:07,184
I hate you, you little prick!
No, I don't.

918
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:10,229
I love your mama.

919
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:12,314
I just--

920
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,108
I can't explain what goes on.

921
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:18,195
You bunch of freaks.
I hope you have fun.

922
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,449
I'll call you tomorrow.

923
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,160
I'm sorry, honey.

924
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,790
I said I'm sorry, Linda.

925
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:37,005
All right.
You can kiss my ass.

926
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,591
And if you ever hit me again,
you little bastard...

927
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,637
I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

928
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,681
You hear me?

929
01:12:05,117 --> 01:12:08,120
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

930
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:11,164
Let's just try
and forget about tonight.

931
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:15,627
We don't need to think about
bad thoughts, do we?

932
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:17,671
No, honey. We don't.

933
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:21,341
I'll make some coffee
and start cleaning up.

934
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:24,428
Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

935
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:27,764
Coffee kindly make me nervous
when I drink it.

936
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:47,659
You scared me.

937
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:52,247
-I didn't aim to.
-You wanna sit down? You need something?

938
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:54,249
No, ma'am.

939
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:15,062
There was these two fellers standing
on a bridge going to the bathroom.

940
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:21,527
One feller says that the water is cold.

941
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,904
The other says that the water is deep.

942
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,536
I believe one feller comes from
Arkansas.

943
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,539
Get it?

944
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:37,209
I'll be dog.

945
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:53,141
Reckon you can make some biscuits?

946
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:55,894
You mean right now?

947
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,606
Whenever you take a notion to.
I don't mean to put you out none.

948
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:03,569
It is nearly breakfast time anyway.

949
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:07,239
I can't go to sleep.
I have to be at work in three hours.

950
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:09,700
You know how it is if you only sleep
an hour or two.

951
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:12,744
You feel worse than if you hadn't
slept at all.

952
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,746
Yes, ma'am. I do.

953
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,669
Sit down.
I'll make you some biscuits and gravy.

954
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,464
- Mustard's good on them to me.
- Okay.

955
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:28,343
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

956
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:34,641
I was thinking--
There's this girl that works with me.

957
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:37,644
She's real heavy,
but she's cute in the face.

958
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:41,148
Well, you know, she's slow.

959
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:47,446
She's a little bit--
She's not retarded.

960
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:50,741
It don't matter.
I thought you might like to meet her.

961
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:53,994
Vaughan wants to have a supper at his
house. We could invite her.

962
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:56,246
Would you like that?

963
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:00,959
I reckon I wouldn't mind
having a little supper.

964
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,463
Vaughan's friend will be there too.
He works at the funeral home.

965
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,134
You know, Frank really likes you a lot.

966
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,887
He says you make him feel calm.

967
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,349
I like Frank.
He's a good boy.

968
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:18,060
Me and him made friends.

969
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,444
It ain't right for me to keep
from telling you...

970
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:30,030
how come me to be in a state hospital.

971
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:34,451
That's okay.
It's not really my business.

972
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:38,622
Have wondered, though.

973
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:42,543
Why was it?
Was it like a nervous breakdown?

974
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:53,345
I killed my mother
and an old boy named Jesse Dixon.

975
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,848
I thought they's doing wrong.

976
01:15:56,723 --> 01:15:59,351
I was about your boy's age.

977
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,603
They told me I'm well from it now.

978
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:03,647
Was that you?

979
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,233
I remember that.
I was only three or four...

980
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,652
but I always heard about it
growing up.

981
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:11,363
They say you're well?

982
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,282
Yes, ma'am.

983
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:22,165
I like your garage.

984
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:29,756
I never would hurt you or that boy.

985
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:33,844
I'd lay my hand on the Bible
and say the same thing.

986
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:36,305
I know you wouldn't, hon.

987
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:46,106
Well, I'll make you some biscuits.

988
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:02,331
How about you, Jerry?

989
01:17:02,456 --> 01:17:04,791
- How are you, Bill?
- Doing pretty good.

990
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:08,462
Got a sick tiller.
What's got you down this way?

991
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:11,173
I thought I'd check up on Karl.
See how things are working out.

992
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:14,676
He's pretty quiet, except for them
rackets and breathing things he does.

993
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:17,095
He ain't threatening me
with a killing or nothing.

994
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:19,473
You couldn't have been more right
about him fixing things.

995
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:22,184
He's a regular Eli Whitney
on a lawn mower.

996
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:26,897
And loves french fries. He can eat
four larges and won't even belch.

997
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,899
I'm proud to have him.

998
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:31,944
- Him staying working out?
- He's gone to staying with...

999
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:34,446
that Wheatley boy and his mama
in their garage.

1000
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:37,366
That little boy's adopted
him like a mascot.

1001
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:39,701
He got a key here
to come and go as he pleases.

1002
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:41,662
He's working out real good.

1003
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,330
- Can I see him?
- Sure.

1004
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,707
Scooter, take Jerry in
to talk to Karl.

1005
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,709
All right.

1006
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:56,134
Sure you'll be okay
staying with that woman and her boy?

1007
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:58,136
Yes, sir.

1008
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,014
Do they know about you?

1009
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:03,058
My history?

1010
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,852
Yeah.

1011
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,563
I told them about it.

1012
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,067
They know I'm well.

1013
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:15,571
That Miss Wheatley
made me some biscuits.

1014
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:18,907
I'll be.

1015
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:22,327
That boy, he's my friend.

1016
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:25,581
He likes the way I talk,
and I like the way he talks.

1017
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,418
I knew you were gonna be all right.

1018
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:32,129
I just wanna check on you.

1019
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:36,175
I'm gonna tell Bill good-bye
and head on back.

1020
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:38,135
All right, then.

1021
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:45,642
Karl, see if you can
figure out what's wrong with this thing.

1022
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,896
It won't crank up. Everything seems
to be put together right.

1023
01:18:49,062 --> 01:18:51,565
- Bill, I'll see you.
- Okay. Stop back by.

1024
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:54,735
Don't worry about your boy.
He's doing good.

1025
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:58,822
It ain't got no gas in it.

1026
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:02,618
You see there, Scooter.
Thinks of the simplest things first.

1027
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:07,706
- Does everybody like the food?
- Yeah.

1028
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:11,168
Good. I haven't decided yet
if I'm a good cook.

1029
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:15,255
Karl, you know what?

1030
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:19,927
Melinda was voted employee of the month
at the Dollar Store last February.

1031
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:22,804
Isn't that something?

1032
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,890
Yes, ma'am. I reckon.

1033
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:28,769
When you like pricing items
as much as I do...

1034
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:32,439
it's just bound to happen
sooner or later, I guess.

1035
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:39,446
Maybe you and Melinda
might like to take a walk tonight.

1036
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:42,449
- It's such a nice evening.
- Vaughan, don't get pushy.

1037
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:44,701
I'm sorry.

1038
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:49,164
I kind of like walking
from time to time.

1039
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:52,042
I stay on my feet all the time at work.

1040
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:55,546
I just can't find shoes
that's comfortable.

1041
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:59,716
Hospital shoes might be the answer.
Nurse's shoes.

1042
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,469
Or the kind old ladies wear
who work in school cafeterias.

1043
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:05,222
Same difference.

1044
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,058
I get real mean when my feet hurt.

1045
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:11,562
It's the only time
I don't like checking out customers.

1046
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:14,147
When my feet hurt.

1047
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,650
You and Karl aren't talking much.

1048
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:19,570
You boys must really like that food.

1049
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:22,698
Well, I ain't got nothing to say
about shoes.

1050
01:20:22,781 --> 01:20:25,158
Listen, everybody.

1051
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:28,036
This might sound corny, but--

1052
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:32,374
I've had some wine
and that tends to make me emotional...

1053
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,501
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1054
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:37,254
It came over me in a rush.

1055
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:39,840
I just want you all to know...

1056
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,012
that I care about
each and every person at this table.

1057
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,264
Thank you.
That's really sweet of you.

1058
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,641
We care about you too.
Don't we, y'all?

1059
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,101
Yeah.

1060
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:56,064
Also, please don't tell anyone
at the store...

1061
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:58,275
that Albert was here tonight.

1062
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,823
Why?

1063
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:07,326
You know how this town is.
People talk...

1064
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:10,829
and they spread cruel rumors.

1065
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:16,251
Unfortunately, there's certain parts
of my life I have to keep private.

1066
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:20,964
You mean about you and Albert
being together in that way?

1067
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:24,468
- Yes.
- I think everybody already knows.

1068
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:26,970
They're always talking about it.

1069
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,390
Maureen Ledbetter told
the most awful story...

1070
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:34,061
about why you ain't allowed
at the First Baptist Church no more.

1071
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:37,731
Karl, why don't you and Melinda
take a walk? It's nice out.

1072
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:46,657
All right, then.

1073
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:57,960
That sure was quick.

1074
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:07,344
You walk fast, don't you?

1075
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,346
I reckon.

1076
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:13,559
These are the worst shoes I own
for walking.

1077
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:17,396
How far'd you say you want to go?

1078
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:21,233
I don't reckon
I thought about it too much.

1079
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,235
I don't know.
She just ain't catching fire.

1080
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:26,196
I don't know.
She just ain't catching fire.

1081
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,615
Did you check them points?

1082
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,160
No, I didn't.

1083
01:22:32,286 --> 01:22:34,454
That's probably it.

1084
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,709
- Yes, ma'am?
- Is Karl here?

1085
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,919
Yes. Just a minute.

1086
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:46,675
Karl. There's somebody out here
to see you.

1087
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:49,678
Some gal holding a nice bouquet.

1088
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:54,141
Come on out. She wants to talk to you.
Don't just sit there.

1089
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:11,658
Hi. I'm on my lunch break.

1090
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,660
These are on sale
'cause they're not fresh.

1091
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:19,958
Two ninety-nine a bunch, plus
my ten percent employee discount.

1092
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:24,505
Since I didn't bring nothing for you
on our date last night...

1093
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:27,007
I thought you might like to have them.

1094
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:36,934
Thank you.

1095
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:40,854
Scooter, let's go over to the Frosty
Cream and pick up something for lunch.

1096
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:42,731
I can go.
You don't have to.

1097
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:45,651
- You don't never go.
- Goddammit, Scooter. Let's go.

1098
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:48,654
Pardon my language, ma'am.

1099
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:07,673
Well, I just thought I'd bring them.

1100
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,051
I liked walking with you.

1101
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:14,346
I got a blister the size of a quarter
on one heel.

1102
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:20,352
Well, I'll see you sometime, I guess.

1103
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,861
Blisters sure can hurt.

1104
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:32,531
Yeah.

1105
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,912
Flowers is pretty.

1106
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:41,373
I've always thought that.

1107
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:46,170
Me too.

1108
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:39,598
Hey, Karl.
How'd you know I was in the garage?

1109
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:44,978
I seen that door cracked open a little.
I figured you was in there.

1110
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,481
- You off of work?
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,359
Where'd you get them flowers?

1112
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,862
That gal that made employee of the month
at the Dollar Store.

1113
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:56,823
She gave them to me
for walking with her.

1114
01:25:58,367 --> 01:26:00,661
I was going over to the secret place.

1115
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:04,039
I borrowed one of your books.
You ain't mad, are you?

1116
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:07,042
No, sir. You can look at every one
of my books you want to.

1117
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,462
Thank you.
It's name's "A Christmas Carol."

1118
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:13,465
That's that one on Christmas
I was telling you about.

1119
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:16,426
You wanna go with me?

1120
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:19,471
All right, then.

1121
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:21,974
- Yeah. Come on.
- All right.

1122
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:32,067
Know why I want you
to play ball with me?

1123
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,569
No.

1124
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:36,989
'Cause it's fun.
Don't matter if you ain't no good.

1125
01:26:37,114 --> 01:26:39,825
It takes your mind
off of everything else.

1126
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:42,619
And when you're trying to score
a touchdown...

1127
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:44,663
that's all you're thinking about.

1128
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:48,041
I ain't no account,
but Daddy always said...

1129
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:52,129
he was proud of me when I threw the ball
and ran with it.

1130
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:56,758
Did you have any brothers and sisters
growing up to play with?

1131
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:59,761
I had one there for a little bit.

1132
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:01,263
But...

1133
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:05,267
it didn't get old enough
for me to play with it.

1134
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,853
Why not? It die?

1135
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:09,771
Yes, sir.

1136
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:11,273
Why?

1137
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:14,943
It got born a little too early.

1138
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:19,615
My mother and father
made it come out too early.

1139
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:23,076
So it died when it come out?

1140
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:28,457
My daddy come out to the shed
and got me...

1141
01:27:28,498 --> 01:27:30,501
said, "Here. Take this
and throw it away."

1142
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:33,921
He handed me a towel
with something or another in it.

1143
01:27:37,174 --> 01:27:38,967
I started for that barrel...

1144
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:44,223
and I opened up the towel
'cause there was a noise...

1145
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:46,391
and something moving around in it.

1146
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:52,356
That towel was all bloody-like
all around it there.

1147
01:27:57,152 --> 01:28:01,365
It was a little old baby,
not no bigger than a squirrel.

1148
01:28:02,199 --> 01:28:04,201
It was alive?

1149
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:06,954
Yes, sir.
Right then it was.

1150
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,207
A boy or girl?

1151
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,919
It was a little old boy.

1152
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:18,215
You threw it in the trash barrel?

1153
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,969
That didn't seem right to me.

1154
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,221
So I went into the shed
and got a shoe box...

1155
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:27,057
and emptied out the screwdrivers,
washers and nuts...

1156
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:29,059
and things out of it.

1157
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:33,564
I taken the little feller
and put him in the box...

1158
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:36,567
buried him in the corner of the yard.

1159
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:40,070
That seemed more proper to me,
I reckon.

1160
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:43,156
It was still alive when you buried it?

1161
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:47,327
I heard it crying a little
through that box.

1162
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:56,378
That don't seem right. It seems like
you would have took care of him...

1163
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:58,547
if he was your brother.

1164
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,757
I wasn't but six or eight.

1165
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:04,178
I reckon I didn't know
what to do.

1166
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:06,471
I didn't know how to care
for no baby.

1167
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:10,017
My mother and father didn't want him.

1168
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,146
They learned me to do
what they told me to do.

1169
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:19,443
I figure it probably best we give him
right back to the good Lord...

1170
01:29:19,568 --> 01:29:21,612
right off the bat anyhow.

1171
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:25,741
That makes me feel real sad.

1172
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:29,077
Couldn't you have done something?

1173
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:31,747
I would have.
I wish I'd had him.

1174
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:35,667
He'd still be right here, now.
Living.

1175
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:38,629
It makes me sad too.

1176
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:42,925
I wish there was something
I could have did about it.

1177
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:49,389
I don't think nothing bad
oughta happen to children.

1178
01:29:50,474 --> 01:29:53,018
I think all those bad things
oughta be saved up...

1179
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:58,023
for the folks that done growed up,
that's the way I see it.

1180
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:03,529
I shouldn't have told you about that.

1181
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:07,032
Boy your age ought not
to hear such things.

1182
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:09,701
It just kind of come out.

1183
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,955
I didn't mean to say nothing
bad about you.

1184
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:17,042
You're good.
You don't mean no harm.

1185
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:21,547
You ever think about killing yourself
on purpose, like Daddy did?

1186
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:26,677
I studied about it some.

1187
01:30:27,678 --> 01:30:29,847
Bible says you ought not to.

1188
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:35,060
Says you do that,
you go off to Hades.

1189
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:38,105
Some folks call it hell.
I call it Hades.

1190
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:43,151
Bible says the same thing
about killing others too.

1191
01:30:53,036 --> 01:30:55,330
Yes, sir.
I reckon it does.

1192
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:16,268
Spend more time over here--

1193
01:31:17,269 --> 01:31:19,146
Well, hell.
There's the boys.

1194
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:21,982
How you doing?
Glad you all came back.

1195
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:26,778
I was wanting to talk to y'all.
Come sit down.

1196
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:28,780
Come on. Sit down.

1197
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:33,827
I was just telling Linda--
We were thinking that things...

1198
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:37,748
would be a lot better if I spent
more time over here.

1199
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:42,669
And if we could--
Hell, I'll just start over.

1200
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:47,257
I took off work early today, and your
mama did the same, so we could talk.

1201
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:51,762
Really what I came over here to do
was apologize--

1202
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:53,972
which ain't easy for me--

1203
01:31:53,972 --> 01:31:56,266
about how I acted the other night.

1204
01:31:57,518 --> 01:31:59,269
I admit it.
I was drunk.

1205
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:04,358
I got all worked up
and one thing led to another.

1206
01:32:05,442 --> 01:32:09,863
I care about you all, though.
I do.

1207
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:13,659
I don't mean to be so damned--

1208
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,703
well, asshole-ish,
I guess would be the word.

1209
01:32:17,871 --> 01:32:20,958
Karl, I don't believe I hit you,
did l?

1210
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:24,169
So no apology necessary, I guess.

1211
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:26,547
But, Frankie, I'm sorry.

1212
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:29,049
I'm sorry I hit your mama.

1213
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:32,970
It's just that I'm jealous of her.

1214
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:35,848
I don't like her life
or how she lives it.

1215
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:39,059
I don't like homosexuals.

1216
01:32:39,142 --> 01:32:43,730
And she goes out and buddies
up with one, so I gotta deal with that.

1217
01:32:43,856 --> 01:32:46,859
I don't like wimpy-ass kids
or mental retards...

1218
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:49,278
and she got one of each
living with her.

1219
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:53,448
I'm just kidding about that.

1220
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,743
I mean, we all got to get along...

1221
01:32:56,869 --> 01:32:59,371
no matter what our differences are.

1222
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:03,083
See, I work construction.

1223
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,043
I build things.

1224
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:08,255
You understand how important that is
to the world, Frankie?

1225
01:33:09,882 --> 01:33:14,261
I don't know if you realize
the pressure a man like me's got on him.

1226
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,349
The upshot is, I'm gonna be spending
a lot more time here.

1227
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:22,352
We're gonna all get along
like a family should.

1228
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:27,274
I might even surprise you
and pop the question.

1229
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:34,072
Well.

1230
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:37,659
I'm gonna get on back over
to the job site...

1231
01:33:37,743 --> 01:33:39,661
Iock up some stuff over there.

1232
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:45,667
I just wanted to stop by and give y'all
a little piece of happiness today.

1233
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:46,960
Bye-bye.

1234
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:55,677
You be a good boy now.
Hear me?

1235
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:06,146
Well, at least he's trying...

1236
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:08,774
but who knows for how long.

1237
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:12,778
He's lying, Mama.
He'll never do better.

1238
01:34:12,861 --> 01:34:15,030
I know, honey.

1239
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:19,868
Just remember what I said.
We'll bide our time.

1240
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:24,039
You just steer clear of him
as much as you can.

1241
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:27,876
Doyle's had a hard life.
It's just about run him crazy.

1242
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:32,214
We had hard lives too, Mama.

1243
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:37,553
You're a hell of a boy, Frank.

1244
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:43,976
Someday, you're gonna get
all the good things you deserve.

1245
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:48,564
Karl's gonna get some more biscuits
tonight. What do you think about that?

1246
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:52,150
I could sure use some.

1247
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:02,452
Karl, come unload
a generator for me.

1248
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:17,467
Lift this thing down
and carry it to the back.

1249
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:20,470
- It's on the blink.
- You want us to help you lift that?

1250
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:23,056
No. That Karl's strong enough
to lift a bulldozer.

1251
01:35:23,182 --> 01:35:25,767
He can fix anything too.

1252
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:28,979
He's mentally retarded, but he's a whiz
at small engines.

1253
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:33,275
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1254
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:36,820
What I was telling you was,
he didn't just make the team...

1255
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:40,949
Coach says he's gonna
start him at end on defense.

1256
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:43,660
Guy's a chip off the old block,
ain't you, Steve?

1257
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:46,747
- I guess so.
- How's the rest of the team look?

1258
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:49,082
Pretty good.
We expect to do well.

1259
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:52,836
- Got a quarterback this year?
- Jeff Bailey's boy. You know him.

1260
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:55,964
- Got a good arm. A little slow.
- I watched him in junior high.

1261
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:58,675
He throws the ball pretty well.
He's taller now.

1262
01:35:58,675 --> 01:36:00,511
You gonna start at the defensive end?

1263
01:36:00,511 --> 01:36:02,513
Hup!

1264
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,349
Come on, man!

1265
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:14,274
Good job, Karl.
We got a touchdown.

1266
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:17,444
That was a good lateral.

1267
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,530
That was just like the wishbone.

1268
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:24,535
Yes, sir.
I darned near made me a touchdown.

1269
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,453
Then I seen them boys
bearing down on me.

1270
01:36:26,537 --> 01:36:30,165
Figured I better give it off
to you. I seen you following me.

1271
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:34,044
We liable to win
if we keep this up.

1272
01:36:34,044 --> 01:36:37,172
For somebody like you,
you sure can run fast.

1273
01:36:37,214 --> 01:36:40,717
- Come on. Let's kick off to them.
- All right, then.

1274
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:48,475
I know you could have
scored that touchdown by yourself...

1275
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:51,144
instead of throwing it over to me.

1276
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:54,982
Them boys was trying to pull me down
pretty hard.

1277
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:57,651
You're strong.
You just threw it to me...

1278
01:36:57,776 --> 01:37:00,779
where I could score that touchdown
so I'd feel good.

1279
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:03,657
My daddy used to do
that kind of thing.

1280
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:09,663
It don't matter to me about us losing.
Does it to you?

1281
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:11,456
No, sir.

1282
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:13,584
It was fun anyhow.

1283
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:18,255
I wasn't thinking about nothing else,
just like you told me I'd do.

1284
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,757
Can we play every Saturday?

1285
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:22,759
If I ain't too stove up.

1286
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:25,679
I ain't like you.
I'm old and give out.

1287
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:31,977
I'm proud of you.

1288
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:49,448
I'd kick your head in
25 years ago.

1289
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:53,452
You're dead, I guess.
Where'd you go to?

1290
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:59,166
I know, Mother. That's kind of sad.
I was drunk when I did it.

1291
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:14,681
I'm your boy.

1292
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:20,020
I ain't got no boy.

1293
01:40:23,357 --> 01:40:26,276
I'm your oldest boy,
name of Karl.

1294
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,278
I ain't got no boy.

1295
01:40:31,365 --> 01:40:33,867
They turned me loose
from the nervous hospital.

1296
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:36,286
Said I was well.

1297
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:50,676
I got hired on to work for Mr. Bill Cox,
fixing lawn mowers and whatnot.

1298
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,349
That grass out there in the yard
growed up quite a bit.

1299
01:40:57,474 --> 01:40:59,685
I figured I might cut it for you.

1300
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:06,149
I told you I ain't got no boy.
Get on out of here and let me be.

1301
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:09,069
You ain't no kin to me.

1302
01:41:12,573 --> 01:41:14,950
I learned to read some.

1303
01:41:18,453 --> 01:41:20,581
I read the Bible quite a bit.

1304
01:41:26,962 --> 01:41:29,047
I can't understand all of it.

1305
01:41:29,173 --> 01:41:32,759
But I reckon I understand
a good deal of it.

1306
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:36,847
Them stories you and Mama told me,
they ain't in there.

1307
01:41:39,183 --> 01:41:42,269
You ought not done that to your boy.

1308
01:41:43,979 --> 01:41:46,773
I studied on killing you.

1309
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:49,776
I studied about it quite a bit.

1310
01:41:54,823 --> 01:41:57,284
But I reckon there's no need for it
if all you're gonna do...

1311
01:41:57,326 --> 01:42:00,454
is sit there in that chair.

1312
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:03,582
You'll be dead soon enough.

1313
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:06,251
And the world'll be shut of you.

1314
01:42:14,343 --> 01:42:17,346
You ought not kill my little brother.

1315
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:22,851
He ought of had
a chance to growed up.

1316
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:28,857
He would have had fun sometime.

1317
01:43:02,683 --> 01:43:04,560
Little feller.

1318
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:20,761
What the goddamn hell
you doing up in the middle of the night?

1319
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:22,679
What you want, hon?

1320
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:24,681
I wanna be baptized.

1321
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:27,267
Get baptized then.
I don't give a shit!

1322
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:30,854
Call up a fucking preacher!
We can't baptize you.

1323
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:34,358
We'll go see Brother Epersom tomorrow
and get you baptized.

1324
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:37,986
It's Sunday.
You go on back to bed now.

1325
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,865
What are you doing
with that damn hammer?

1326
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:49,456
I don't rightly know.
I just woke up holding it.

1327
01:44:58,549 --> 01:45:01,385
- What's he's doing with that hammer?
- I don't know.

1328
01:45:24,283 --> 01:45:28,579
Upon his profession of faith
in our Lord Jesus Christ...

1329
01:45:28,704 --> 01:45:31,290
in obedience under His command...

1330
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,584
and by the authority of this church...

1331
01:45:33,709 --> 01:45:36,879
I indeed baptize this brother...

1332
01:45:37,004 --> 01:45:39,798
in the name of the Father
and the Son...

1333
01:45:39,882 --> 01:45:41,800
and the Holy Ghost.

1334
01:45:45,095 --> 01:45:46,805
Amen.

1335
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:49,516
Marie, would you sing 137, please?

1336
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:53,979
Softly and tenderly

1337
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:56,982
Jesus is calling

1338
01:45:58,108 --> 01:46:03,447
Calling for you and for me

1339
01:46:09,286 --> 01:46:12,080
- How'd the baptizing go?
- Real good.

1340
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,082
Yeah? Good.

1341
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:17,377
I'm kind of hungry.

1342
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:20,088
Isn't it about time to eat?

1343
01:46:20,088 --> 01:46:24,134
You know what I got a crave for?
Some of that Chicken Champ.

1344
01:46:24,301 --> 01:46:26,887
Why don't you run down and get some?
I'll buy.

1345
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:28,972
Would y'all like that?

1346
01:46:29,097 --> 01:46:30,974
It sounds fine to me.

1347
01:46:31,099 --> 01:46:33,977
I'd value me a chicken leg or two.

1348
01:46:36,396 --> 01:46:40,484
- Get some of their cole slaw too.
- Okay. Y'all wanna go with me?

1349
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:42,986
They don't need to go with you.
There's a ball game coming on.

1350
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:47,282
- We'll sit here and do man things.
- I'll be back in a little bit.

1351
01:46:47,282 --> 01:46:50,494
- All right. Get some extra gravy.
- Okay.

1352
01:46:55,582 --> 01:46:58,085
Why don't y'all
sit your asses down here.

1353
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:01,088
Sit down.

1354
01:47:13,684 --> 01:47:17,688
I just wanted to get your mama
out of the house so we could talk.

1355
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,410
Here's the deal, Frank.

1356
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:37,791
If I'm gonna throw my life away
to come live with y'all...

1357
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:43,005
we're gonna get some shit straight.

1358
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:47,301
Your mama and I don't have no problems
except for you.

1359
01:47:47,301 --> 01:47:50,679
Fact is, we never have
a bad word between us.

1360
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:53,015
But since you do exist...

1361
01:47:53,098 --> 01:47:55,893
and I'm gonna be
the head of the household...

1362
01:47:55,893 --> 01:47:58,312
you're gonna learn
to live by my rules.

1363
01:47:58,395 --> 01:48:02,399
The first rule is: You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

1364
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:04,109
You got me?

1365
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:08,280
Now you stay
the hell out of my way.

1366
01:48:08,405 --> 01:48:11,116
And do what a regular kid does.

1367
01:48:11,116 --> 01:48:14,912
You're a weird little shit, Frank.
And I don't get you.

1368
01:48:14,953 --> 01:48:19,583
So wake up
and face what they call reality.

1369
01:48:20,459 --> 01:48:22,377
We're gonna be a family.

1370
01:48:22,461 --> 01:48:24,880
My family.

1371
01:48:24,963 --> 01:48:27,591
I'll be paying all the bills.

1372
01:48:27,716 --> 01:48:30,469
So that means,
you're stuck with my ass...

1373
01:48:30,594 --> 01:48:32,471
but I ain't your daddy.

1374
01:48:33,597 --> 01:48:36,099
You just act like I am.

1375
01:48:36,141 --> 01:48:38,143
The other thing I say is...

1376
01:48:38,143 --> 01:48:40,145
your buddy Karl is going.

1377
01:48:41,813 --> 01:48:44,399
We can't be no normal family
with him living in the garage...

1378
01:48:44,483 --> 01:48:47,611
and coming in the bedroom
at 4:00 in the morning with hammers.

1379
01:48:47,653 --> 01:48:50,113
Karl could stay if he wants to.
Mama said--

1380
01:48:50,155 --> 01:48:52,115
What I tell you about your mama?

1381
01:48:52,157 --> 01:48:55,577
Mister, don't you never
lay another hand on that boy.

1382
01:48:55,577 --> 01:48:58,664
- You understand me?
- Let go of my hand, you retard.

1383
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:02,167
Get out there!
Get your shit and get out!

1384
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:07,297
That's a wake-up call, Frankie.

1385
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:09,508
You remember what I said
about reality!

1386
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:12,594
Get out, retard.

1387
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:42,082
Where you going?
Didn't you want some chicken and things?

1388
01:49:42,207 --> 01:49:45,502
No, ma'am.
I'm going off somewheres.

1389
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:48,213
Well, okay.
I got you some.

1390
01:49:48,297 --> 01:49:50,591
Frank-- he went off somewheres too.

1391
01:49:50,716 --> 01:49:53,093
So when you go in there,
he won't be indoors.

1392
01:49:53,218 --> 01:49:55,095
Where did he go?
What's going on?

1393
01:49:55,179 --> 01:49:58,015
He just wanted to go play, I reckon.

1394
01:49:58,015 --> 01:50:00,017
You go in and eat
with that Doyle...

1395
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,686
and don't worry yourself none.

1396
01:50:02,686 --> 01:50:04,688
All right, then.

1397
01:50:04,813 --> 01:50:06,690
Well, I'll see you later.

1398
01:50:06,815 --> 01:50:08,775
If you see Frank,
tell him to come home.

1399
01:50:08,901 --> 01:50:10,944
I don't get to see him
except Sundays.

1400
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:13,780
He can go play tomorrow.

1401
01:50:13,906 --> 01:50:15,782
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

1402
01:50:19,912 --> 01:50:22,915
You're a good mama to that boy.

1403
01:50:22,956 --> 01:50:25,209
You care for him.

1404
01:50:25,209 --> 01:50:28,086
You work hard to care for him.

1405
01:50:28,212 --> 01:50:30,881
You light him up in his eyes.

1406
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:32,883
I've seen it.

1407
01:50:34,092 --> 01:50:37,638
That boy wouldn't know what to do
without you.

1408
01:50:37,804 --> 01:50:40,307
Thank you.
That's real good of you to say.

1409
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:43,101
I wouldn't know what to do
without him either.

1410
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:45,646
You been real good to me too.

1411
01:50:45,812 --> 01:50:50,108
It ain't everybody that'd make biscuits
in the middle of the night.

1412
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:53,153
You and that boy's
given me a good feeling.

1413
01:50:54,154 --> 01:50:56,907
We sure like having you.

1414
01:50:56,990 --> 01:50:58,909
Thank you.

1415
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:03,664
I'm just now getting around
to telling you--

1416
01:51:03,789 --> 01:51:08,293
But I fixed that washing machine so that
boy ain't gotta tote laundry no more.

1417
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:10,504
Thank you.

1418
01:51:16,176 --> 01:51:18,178
You been real good to me.

1419
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:38,407
Hey, Karl.
How'd you know I'd come out here?

1420
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:41,910
I knowed you'd be out here.

1421
01:51:41,994 --> 01:51:44,580
What you doing
digging with that stub?

1422
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:47,916
Just digging.
I ain't never gonna be happy now.

1423
01:51:47,916 --> 01:51:51,378
Not with that son-of-a-bitch
moving in for good.

1424
01:51:51,503 --> 01:51:54,381
I wish me and you and Mama
would just run away.

1425
01:51:54,506 --> 01:51:56,717
She said...

1426
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,219
wherever we went,
he'd find us.

1427
01:51:59,303 --> 01:52:04,516
He's crazy. Sometimes I think it'd been
better off if I wasn't even born.

1428
01:52:05,601 --> 01:52:07,978
I'm glad of it
you was borned.

1429
01:52:11,106 --> 01:52:14,776
I don't reckon I'm gonna be out there
in the garage no more.

1430
01:52:14,902 --> 01:52:17,613
You have to.
You have to look out for me.

1431
01:52:17,696 --> 01:52:20,449
You can't let that
son-of-a-bitch run you off.

1432
01:52:20,449 --> 01:52:24,912
You just a boy.
You ought not use language like that.

1433
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:28,457
I don't mean to say nothing
bad about you...

1434
01:52:28,582 --> 01:52:32,419
but why don't you stop Doyle
when he's being that way?

1435
01:52:33,587 --> 01:52:36,089
You're older than him.
You're strong too.

1436
01:52:37,466 --> 01:52:41,470
My daddy wouldn't let him
do that to me and Mama.

1437
01:52:43,388 --> 01:52:46,391
That feller's a whole site
meaner than me.

1438
01:52:46,391 --> 01:52:48,810
He'd just whup the tar out of me.

1439
01:52:48,894 --> 01:52:51,396
Yeah. I guess so.

1440
01:52:53,106 --> 01:52:55,150
I'm real tired,
you know that?

1441
01:52:56,652 --> 01:52:59,488
A boy my age shouldn't
be tired of things.

1442
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:04,910
I'm tired too.

1443
01:53:07,913 --> 01:53:12,084
Just 'cause I ain't gonna be
around no more, maybe...

1444
01:53:12,084 --> 01:53:14,586
that don't mean
I don't care for you.

1445
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:17,005
I care for you a good deal.

1446
01:53:17,089 --> 01:53:20,092
I care for you more
than anything else there is.

1447
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:22,594
You and me made friends
right off the bat.

1448
01:53:23,804 --> 01:53:26,306
I care for you too.
But you'll be around.

1449
01:53:26,348 --> 01:53:28,809
Don't say that.

1450
01:53:28,809 --> 01:53:32,104
It don't make no difference
where I was to be.

1451
01:53:32,187 --> 01:53:36,984
We'll always be friends.
Can't nobody stop that.

1452
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:50,205
I aim for you to have these books.

1453
01:53:50,289 --> 01:53:53,208
You don't wanna give away
all your books.

1454
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:55,294
I aim for you to have them.

1455
01:54:04,094 --> 01:54:08,098
Maybe you can make more sense of them
than I can.

1456
01:54:08,182 --> 01:54:13,312
I made you a bookmarker and put it
in that book on Christmas.

1457
01:54:17,191 --> 01:54:19,193
Thanks.

1458
01:54:20,944 --> 01:54:24,615
You know when you got a feeling
and you don't know why?

1459
01:54:24,698 --> 01:54:27,201
Yes, sir.

1460
01:54:27,284 --> 01:54:30,787
I got a feeling today.

1461
01:54:30,913 --> 01:54:33,790
Reckon, what kind of a feeling?

1462
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:37,419
Like something different.
I don't know.

1463
01:54:40,088 --> 01:54:41,965
You leaving, ain't you?

1464
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,479
Would you do something for me
if I was to ask you to?

1465
01:54:55,604 --> 01:54:59,107
You know I would.
Whatever you want.

1466
01:55:01,401 --> 01:55:03,487
When you leave outta here tonight...

1467
01:55:03,612 --> 01:55:07,491
I don't want you going over there
and staying with that Doyle.

1468
01:55:09,993 --> 01:55:14,790
He's got it out for you tonight.
I got me a feeling too.

1469
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:18,710
You ought not be over there
when he's all liquored up and mean.

1470
01:55:18,794 --> 01:55:20,712
Your mama neither.

1471
01:55:21,797 --> 01:55:26,218
When you get up here and leave, I want
you to go to that feller's house--

1472
01:55:26,218 --> 01:55:28,720
your mama's friend.

1473
01:55:31,306 --> 01:55:34,518
I want you to give me your word on it.

1474
01:55:34,601 --> 01:55:37,396
Okay. I give you my word on it.

1475
01:55:38,981 --> 01:55:42,901
Is everything gonna be okay?
Are you all right?

1476
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:50,701
Yeah, everything's gonna be all right,
boy.

1477
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:00,794
I kind of wanna put my arm
around you for a minute...

1478
01:56:00,919 --> 01:56:04,298
then I'm gonna get up
and leave out of here.

1479
01:56:32,284 --> 01:56:35,204
I love you, boy.

1480
01:56:36,788 --> 01:56:38,707
I love you too.

1481
01:56:42,586 --> 01:56:45,297
All right, then.

1482
01:57:25,212 --> 01:57:27,589
What are you doing here?
You wanna come in?

1483
01:57:27,714 --> 01:57:32,302
I ain't staying.
I need to ask you for a favor.

1484
01:57:34,388 --> 01:57:37,683
This evening
I want you to go get Miss Wheatley...

1485
01:57:37,808 --> 01:57:41,895
and let her and Frank
stay over here with you tonight.

1486
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,481
What's wrong?
ls everything all right?

1487
01:57:44,606 --> 01:57:46,817
That Doyle...

1488
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:51,697
he's in a bad way again with
that drinking and being mean to folks.

1489
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:54,199
I want you to give me your word
you'll do it.

1490
01:57:54,199 --> 01:57:57,202
Sure. Okay.
He hasn't hurt them, has he?

1491
01:57:57,286 --> 01:57:59,621
No, sir.
Not yet.

1492
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:02,416
Here.

1493
01:58:02,499 --> 01:58:04,918
I want you to give that
to Miss Wheatley.

1494
01:58:04,918 --> 01:58:06,920
It ain't much...

1495
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,215
but they might be
a little something there to help out.

1496
01:58:10,299 --> 01:58:14,219
It's what I made fixing lawn mowers
and whatnot for Bill Cox.

1497
01:58:15,804 --> 01:58:18,682
How about you, Karl?
You wanna stay here?

1498
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:25,522
I don't reckon that you have to go with
women to be a good daddy to a boy.

1499
01:58:25,606 --> 01:58:28,901
You been real square
dealing with me.

1500
01:58:28,984 --> 01:58:32,696
Bible says two men
ought not lay together.

1501
01:58:34,406 --> 01:58:39,995
But I bet you the good Lord
wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades.

1502
01:58:41,413 --> 01:58:44,917
That boy-- Frank--

1503
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,295
he lives inside of his own heart.

1504
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:51,215
That's an awful big place to live in.

1505
01:58:53,217 --> 01:58:55,802
You take care of that boy.

1506
01:58:59,389 --> 01:59:02,100
I will.

1507
02:01:55,899 --> 02:01:57,901
Where's everybody else?

1508
02:02:05,492 --> 02:02:07,411
You seen them?

1509
02:02:14,793 --> 02:02:18,297
Didn't I tell you
to get moved out of here?

1510
02:02:21,717 --> 02:02:25,304
How does a feller go about
getting hold of the police?

1511
02:02:31,518 --> 02:02:34,313
Use the fucking phone, I guess.

1512
02:02:35,606 --> 02:02:37,900
Which numbers do you put in?

1513
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,119
Can't you see I'm trying to relax?

1514
02:02:51,288 --> 02:02:55,292
I thought I told you
to get out of here and leave me alone.

1515
02:03:00,422 --> 02:03:02,925
What the hell you doing
with that lawn mower blade?

1516
02:03:03,884 --> 02:03:06,386
I aim to kill you with it.

1517
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:22,903
To call the police you push...

1518
02:03:22,986 --> 02:03:27,407
nine, one, one.

1519
02:03:32,704 --> 02:03:35,415
Just tell them
to bring an ambulance.

1520
02:03:38,502 --> 02:03:41,797
Or a "hearst,"
if you're gonna kill me.

1521
02:04:41,398 --> 02:04:43,692
Yes, ma'am.

1522
02:04:43,817 --> 02:04:46,695
I need the police
sent over here to the Wheatley house.

1523
02:04:49,907 --> 02:04:55,120
I've killed Doyle Hargraves
with a lawn mower blade.

1524
02:04:55,204 --> 02:04:59,291
Yes, ma'am.
I'm right sure of it.

1525
02:04:59,416 --> 02:05:02,085
I hit him
two good whacks with it.

1526
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:06,507
That second one
just plumb near cut his head in two.

1527
02:05:09,801 --> 02:05:12,012
It's a little old white house...

1528
02:05:12,095 --> 02:05:16,808
on the corner of Vine Street
and some other street.

1529
02:05:16,808 --> 02:05:22,105
There's a truck out front, says
"Doyle Hargraves Construction" on it.

1530
02:05:24,816 --> 02:05:27,611
I'll be sitting here
waiting on you.

1531
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:32,491
And Doyle said
besides sending the police...

1532
02:05:32,616 --> 02:05:34,826
you might wanna send an ambulance...

1533
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:37,287
or a "hearst."

1534
02:05:38,789 --> 02:05:40,791
Thank you.

1535
02:06:44,396 --> 02:06:45,898
So...

1536
02:06:47,024 --> 02:06:50,819
now on the third day...

1537
02:06:50,903 --> 02:06:55,991
I washed her,
'cause she wasn't too clean, you know.

1538
02:06:56,116 --> 02:06:58,911
But I got all the right spots.

1539
02:06:58,994 --> 02:07:00,913
She was the first one I ever kept...

1540
02:07:00,996 --> 02:07:06,001
'cause I get bored real easy--
I got a short attention span, you know.

1541
02:07:07,628 --> 02:07:13,091
Now I can't say
that she enjoyed her stay...

1542
02:07:15,719 --> 02:07:20,224
with that washcloth I put in her mouth
and held in place with duct tape.

1543
02:07:20,307 --> 02:07:22,309
Kept her complaining down to a minimum.

1544
02:07:22,309 --> 02:07:24,603
I don't like people
who talk all the time.

1545
02:07:24,686 --> 02:07:27,105
I like to do all the talking.

1546
02:07:27,189 --> 02:07:30,317
That's why I think I'm
so fond of you...

1547
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:33,320
'cause you just so easygoing, you know.

1548
02:07:36,198 --> 02:07:40,827
Although, I do sense a little tension
in you from time to time.

1549
02:07:43,705 --> 02:07:46,708
So you were out in the world?

1550
02:07:48,293 --> 02:07:51,088
Did you have fun?
Did you make any acquaintances?

1551
02:07:52,214 --> 02:07:55,801
There was a boy.
We made friends.

1552
02:07:55,926 --> 02:07:57,803
I'll bet you did.

1553
02:08:01,306 --> 02:08:05,894
I was never bent that way.
I was bent the other way.

1554
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,814
So?

1555
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:15,112
What was it like out there
in the world?

1556
02:08:16,405 --> 02:08:18,323
It was too big.

1557
02:08:21,493 --> 02:08:23,912
It's not too big in here, is it?

1558
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,798
You know something?

1559
02:08:34,798 --> 02:08:36,800
I feel real...

1560
02:08:37,926 --> 02:08:40,512
generous today--
I feel like listening.

1561
02:08:41,805 --> 02:08:44,308
I bet you got plenty to tell.

1562
02:08:50,189 --> 02:08:52,566
Who'd you kill?

1563
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:56,028
Was it the boy?

1564
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:59,323
Don't you say nothing
about that boy.

1565
02:09:05,621 --> 02:09:10,125
Fact of business,
don't you say another word to me.

1566
02:09:10,125 --> 02:09:13,420
I ain't listening to you no more.

1567
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,728
Yeah.
