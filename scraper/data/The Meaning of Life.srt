I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

471
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,597
If you're not
getting your hair cut,

472
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,308
you don't have to move your brother's
clothes down to the lower peg.

473
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,144
You simply collect his note
before lunch,

474
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,071
after you've done
your scripture prep,

475
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,740
when you've written
your letter home before rest,

476
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,910
move your own clothes
onto the lower peg,

477
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,154
greet the visitors
and report to Mr. Viney

478
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,910
that you've had
your chit signed.

479
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,575
Now, sex.

480
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,464
Sex, sex, sex.
Where were we?

481
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,383
Well, had I got as far as

482
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,217
the penis entering the vagina?

483
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,892
No, sir.
No, sir. No, sir.

484
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,437
Well, had I done foreplay?

485
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,812
STU DENTS: Yes, sir.

486
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,195
Ah. Well, as we all know
all about foreplay,

487
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,575
no doubt you can tell me what
the purpose of foreplay is.

488
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,205
Biggs.

489
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,291
Don't know.
Sorry, sir.

490
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,789
Carter?

491
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,377
Oh, was it taking
your clothes off, sir?

492
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,467
Well, and after that?

493
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,549
Oh, putting them
on a lower peg, sir.

494
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:51,147
The purpose of foreplay is to
cause the vagina to lubricate,

495
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,977
so that the penis
can penetrate more easily.

496
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,944
Could we have a window open,
please, sir?

497
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,613
Yes. Harris, will you?

498
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,316
And, of course, to cause
the man's penis to erect

499
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,739
and harden.

500
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,703
(IN HALING)

501
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:10,083
Now, did I do
vaginal juices last week?

502
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,910
Oh, do pay attention,
Wadsworth!

503
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,212
I know it's Friday. Watching
the football, are you?

504
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,541
Boy, move over there.
I'm warning you.

505
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,718
I may decide
to set an exam this term.

506
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,929
Oh, sir!
Sir!

507
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,223
So just listen.

508
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,470
Now did I or did I not

509
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,682
do vaginal juices?

510
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,434
STU DENTS: Yes, sir.

511
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,692
Name two ways of getting them
flowing, Watson.

512
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,114
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

513
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,364
What's wrong
with a kiss, boy? Hmm?

514
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,621
Why not start her off
with a nice kiss?

515
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,377
You don't
have to go leaping

516
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,454
straight for the clitoris
like a bull at a gate.

517
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,881
Give her a kiss, boy.

518
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,212
Suck the nipple, sir?
Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

519
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,638
Stroking the thighs, sir?
Yes, yes.

520
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,636
I suppose so.
Biting the neck.

521
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,809
Yes, good.
Nibbling the earlobe,

522
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,558
kneading the buttocks
and so on and so forth.

523
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,890
So we have
all these possibilities,

524
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:19,232
before we stampede
towards the clitoris, Watson.

525
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,484
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

526
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,736
Now, all these forms
of stimulation

527
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,285
can now take place.

528
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,793
And, of course, tonguing
will give you the best idea

529
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,588
of how the juices
are coming along.

530
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,297
Helen?
Now, penetration and coitus,

531
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:50,429
that is to say intercourse
up to and including orgasm.

532
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,265
Ah, hello, dear. Do stand up when
my wife enters the room, Carter.

533
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,974
Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry.

534
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,684
H ELEN: Humphrey, I hope
you don't mind.

535
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,236
I told the Garfields we would
dine with them tonight.

536
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
Yes, yes, well,
I suppose we must.

537
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,115
I said we'd be
there by 8:00.

538
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,993
At least it'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

539
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,951
I know you don't like them, but
I couldn't make another excuse.

540
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,828
It's just that I felt...

541
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,078
Wymer, this is
for your benefit.

542
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,289
Would you kindly
wake up?

543
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,291
I've no intention of going
through this all again.

544
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,389
We'll take the foreplay as
read, if you don't mind, dear.

545
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,564
No, of course not,
Humphrey.

546
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,145
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife,

547
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,025
in the standard way.

548
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:50,281
The penis is now, as you will
observe, more or less fully erect.

549
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,821
There we are,
that's better.

550
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,118
Now, Carter.

551
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,663
Yes, sir?
What is it?

552
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,668
It's an ocarina, sir.
Bring it up here.

553
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,260
The man now starts making thrusting
movements with his pelvic area,

554
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,259
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina.

555
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:14,218
Put it there, boy.
Put it there on the table.

556
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,271
While the wife maximizes her clitoral
stimulation by the shaft of the penis,

557
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,098
by pushing forward.

558
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,520
Thank you, dear.

559
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,945
What's funny, Biggs?

560
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,943
Oh, nothing, sir.

561
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,366
Do, please, share your little
joke with the rest of us.

562
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,282
I mean, obviously, something
frightfully funny's going on.

No, honestly, sir.

Well, as it's so funny,

we could hardly move

would be out there,

it is a struggle between alternative
viewpoints of life itself.

Without the ability to
defend one's own viewpoint,

against other perhaps
more aggressive ideologies,

663
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,753
then reasonableness and moderation
could quite simply disappear.

clean with you about this.

I'm afraid.

You see, a virus is what we
doctors call very, very small,

774
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,672

have made off with a whole leg.

is no more than an educated guess,

You looked after it
like a son.

wherever I did go.

the drawers in the bureau?

elusive fish.

911
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,597
And it went
wherever I did go.

912
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:46,852
Oh! Fishy, fishy,

913
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:51,527

Great! Yeah!

918
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,545
Best bit so far.
Fantastic! Really great!

919

Really risky, yeah.

920

think she writes her own material.

writes her material.

No. Burt Bacharach writes it.

Eric!

1124
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,191
Which brings us, once again,
to the urgent realization

1125
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,619
of just how much there is
still left to own.

1126
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:37,455
Item six on the agenda,
the Meaning of Life.

1127
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,330
Now, Harry, you've had
some thoughts on this.

1128
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,508
I've had a team working on
this over the past few weeks,

1129
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:50,134
and what we've come up with can be
reduced to two fundamental concepts.

1130
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,682
One. People are not wearing enough hats.

1131
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,974
Two. Matter is energy.

1132
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:02,233
In the universe, there are many energy
fields which we cannot normally perceive.

1133
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:07,272
Some energies have a spiritual source,
which act upon a person's soul.

1134
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,610
However, this soul
does not exist <i>ab initio,</i>

1135
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,366
as orthodox Christianity
teaches.

1136
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,743
It has to be
brought into existence,

1137
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,951
by a process of guided
self-observation.

1138
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:24,543
However, this is rarely achieved,
owing to man's unique ability

1139
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,877
to be distracted from spiritual
matters by everyday trivia.

1140
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,345
What was that about
hats again?

1141
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,936
Oh, people aren't
wearing enough.

1142
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,433
Is this true?

1143
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,561
Certainly.
Hat sales have increased,

1144
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,142
but not pari passu,
as our research...

1145
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,774
When you say "enough,"
enough for what purpose?

1146
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,321
Can I just ask, with reference
to your second point,

1147
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:53,948
when you say souls don't develop
because people become distracted...

1148
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,865
Has anyone noticed
that building there before?

1149
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,919
What?

that's the fastest speed there is</i>

1537
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:46,238
<i>So remember when you're feeling
very small and insecure</i>

1538
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:49,491
<i>How amazingly unlikely
is your birth</i>

1539
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:53,825
<i>And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere up in space</i>

1540
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:56,787
<i>'Cause there's bugger all
down here on Earth</i>
