1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:20,044
The Hurt Locker

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,044
Go, go!

3
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:31,037
Approaching.

4
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,881
I think we have touchdown.

5
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,555
Little to the right.

6
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,495
Hello, mum.

7
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:17,833
Now, push it in.

8
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,296
I can't.

9
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,881
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.

10
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:26,550
How about I pretend it's your dick?

11
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,135
You'll never get in if you did that.

12
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,347
- Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.

13
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,766
- No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.

14
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:40,856
Fucker.

15
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,861
- Got that.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,615
Here we go.

17
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:55,997
Oh, look at that.

18
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,873
- Nice 155, huh?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,086
It's going to
do some fucking damage.

20
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:05,214
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.

21
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:06,549
I got that.

22
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:10,094
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

23
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,805
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.

24
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:15,975
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

25
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:18,185
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

26
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,145
Yep.

27
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,648
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,

28
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,692
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.

29
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,777
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.

30
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,198
Bot is moving.

31
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:47,757
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

32
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,175
Good to go.

33
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:52,011
All right. Wagon's
set up. Bot moves.

34
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:56,515
Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.

35
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:58,517
Goats 12:00. Watch out.

36
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,728
Load them little bastards up.

37
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:18,872
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

38
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,084
Oh, fuck.

39
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,336
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

40
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,380
- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.

41
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,715
All right. Looks like
I'm going down there.

42
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,884
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

43
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:31,885
Oh, I love it.

44
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:44,272
So, if everything looks okay,
when I get down there

45
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,650
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it.

46
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,610
Give these people
something to think about.

47
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,571
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

48
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,323
we're just going to blow up
their little fucking road.

49
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,282
Sounds good.

50
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,703
Craving a burger; is that strange?

51
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,538
- Not for you.
- No, okay.

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,039
Helmet on.

53
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,333
Happy trails.

54
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,301
Blaster One, can you read me?

55
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,595
Roger that, Blaster one.
You're good to go.

56
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,061
You're looking good, Blaster One.

57
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,624
Nice and hot in here.

58
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:52,841
One fifty.

59
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,052
Roger that, 150 meters

60
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:10,108
Hi.

61
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,277
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:13,820
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

63
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,238
California?

64
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:16,657
- Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?

65
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:19,117
Hey, this ain't no fucking meet
and greet. Now get out of here.

66
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:20,786
Now.

67
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:25,082
Go.

68
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,801
You making friends again, Sanborn?

69
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:37,511
All day long.

70
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,977
Twenty-five.

71
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:49,356
Twenty-five meters. Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.

72
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,026
Thanks for reminding me.

73
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,153
That's what I'm here for, baby.

74
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,572
Okay-

75
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,624
The debts look good.

76
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,543
Roger that,

77
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:41,533
I'm laying on the charge.

78
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:43,910
Nice and sweet.

79
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,122
We're good to go.

80
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:48,999
I'm coming back.

81
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:54,421
- Five meters out.
- Five meters, Roger that.

82
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:55,922
Hey, Sanborn

83
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:59,468
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.

84
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,178
Needs grass.

85
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:04,723
We gonna start our grass business?

86
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:05,849
That's right, man

87
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:09,936
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.

88
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:13,315
It's going to be called
"Sanborn and Sons".

89
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,318
We'll be rich.

90
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,114
I like that, Crabgass.
St. Augustine, man.

91
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,866
I'm a scholar on this shit.

92
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,704
How about this?
You sell it. I fertilize it.

93
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,667
- 25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.

94
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,251
Sanborn!

95
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,296
Butcher shop, 2:00,
dude has a phone!

96
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,673
Why is Eldridge running?

97
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,759
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!

98
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,594
Come on, guys. Talk to me.

99
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:45,430
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!

100
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,933
Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him!

101
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,477
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!

102
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,312
- Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone!

103
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,272
Make him put it down!
Go get it!

104
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,651
- Come on, Eldridge!
- I can't get him in sight!

105
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,502
Thompson!

106
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:45,782
Anywhere's good.

107
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:09,264
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

108
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:46,426
Yeah?

109
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:51,973
Come in,

110
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,560
Sergeant James.

111
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:00,941
JT Sanborn, my man.

112
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,985
Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.

113
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,070
Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory.

114
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,739
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.

115
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:10,617
Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.

116
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:11,910
Victory sounds better.

117
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,788
All right. Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right?

118
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:15,539
Yeah.

119
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,582
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

120
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:18,667
Yeah, no problem.

121
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,794
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

122
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,421
We get a lot of mortars at night.

123
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,716
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.

124
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:26,883
That's why it's up there.

125
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,469
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

126
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,013
from coming in through
the roof, you know.

127
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:34,349
Besides, I like the sunshine.

128
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:37,936
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

129
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:40,355
- I know he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.

130
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,774
He was a great team leader too.

131
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,736
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.

132
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,446
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.

133
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:50,574
- Appreciate it.
- All right.

134
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,159
Cool.

135
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:57,039
Home sweet home, right?

136
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,091
Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?

137
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,136
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.

138
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,305
I'd rather be
on the side with the tanks,

139
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,182
just in case, rather than not have them.

140
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

141
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,686
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.

142
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,064
Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.

143
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,233
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

144
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,027
How's a fucking tank
supposed to stop that?

145
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,613
- Would you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry.

146
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,865
Just trying to scare the new guy.

147
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,743
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.

148
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:45,421
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.

149
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,804
Move.

150
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,180
Move!

151
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,386
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

152
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:35,722
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

153
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:47,358
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

154
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,544
Victory Main. Victory Main.
this is Blaster Mike.

155
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,630
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.

156
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:18,473
Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid.

157
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:28,024
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.

158
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:30,234
Give us a second to confirm.

159
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:32,487
Watch your feet.

160
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:36,074
Set visual
is three-four five-three.

161
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:38,076
Got the Humvee.

162
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,664
Friendly!

163
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,709
Friendly.

164
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,395
Ah, here we go.

165
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,648
They abandoned their vehicle.

166
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:11,025
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.

167
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,277
Yeah, I got it.

168
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:17,365
Let's move.

169
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:20,994
Friendly.

170
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,709
- Morning, boys.
- Sir.

171
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,086
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.

172
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,755
Step out and I'll
show you what's going on.

173
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:33,506
All right.

174
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,550
Down on that block 20 meters,

175
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,677
this side of the mosque,
east side of the street,

176
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,679
our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

177
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,222
going into a rubble pile.

178
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,057
- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah.

179
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,934
- I trust this guy. I know him.
- Okay.

180
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:45,727
I'll handle it.

181
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,103
- Do you want to talk him or...
- No.

182
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,480
Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.

183
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,233
Specialist, bring up the Humvee.

184
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,151
What's going on?

185
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm going to break out the suit.

186
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,947
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.

187
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,241
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

188
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,284
I'll handle it.

189
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,411
That's kind of tight down here, James.

190
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,094
Ready?

191
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:24,932
Good?

192
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:38,196
You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.

193
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,322
I'll be all right.

194
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,670
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

195
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,260
How's it looking, Eldridge?

196
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,762
- Good to go.
- Let's do it.

197
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,149
- Got two of them?
- Got two.

198
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,901
All right. Let's rock and roll, man.

199
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:38,297
- He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.

200
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,770
Blaster One, what's going on?

201
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,982
Blaster One! What are you doing?

202
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,485
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.

203
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,279
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

204
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,950
Hey. James, can you hear me?

205
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,329
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.

206
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,081
Creating a diversion

207
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:13,458
From what? Is there a threat?

208
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,960
Eldridge, get up on the wall. Move!

209
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,089
Tell me what you see, specialist.

210
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,217
All right, I got him.

211
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:24,844
He's walking down range.

212
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:27,513
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.

213
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:29,599
Where are you
in relationship to the IED?

214
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,225
Are you within 100 meters yet?

215
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:35,355
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

216
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:13,726
Take cover!

217
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,443
Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn

218
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,405
Shit. James! James, come back now.

219
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,532
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.

220
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,661
Want me to send backup?

221
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,496
I got it.

222
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,957
- Get here!
- Negative! Negative!

223
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:37,333
Stand down.

224
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,293
The blast will come up the block.

225
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,254
Stay clear around the corner.

226
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,173
EOD has the situation
under control, over.

227
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,760
Where you going?

228
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:50,096
Want to back up?

229
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,562
Get out of the car!

230
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,773
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!

231
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,362
What the fuck are you doing?

232
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:09,783
Back up.

233
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,289
Hello?

234
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:31,430
Want to get back?

235
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,328
It's that way.

236
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,459
Back.

237
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:21,647
Taxi's moving.

238
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,483
Get out of the car!
Stop!

239
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,492
Stay down!

240
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,872
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent.
he sure the hell is now.

241
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,875
Roger that. That's real funny.

242
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:37,973
Got something.

243
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:50,903
Oh, baby.

244
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:23,978
Gotcha.

245
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:39,660
All right.

246
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,500
We're done.

247
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,422
Good to go.

248
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:52,965
Come down, specialist.

249
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,384
Roger.

250
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,191
Got a wire.

251
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,777
Hang on.

252
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,327
Where are you going?

253
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,343
Secondary.

254
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:38,344
Shit.

255
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,095
Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.

256
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,911
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?

257
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:35,544
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.

258
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,672
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.

259
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,424
We're going on a mission,

260
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:43,677
and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.

261
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,304
It's combat, buddy.

262
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,063
Hey.

263
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,856
It's just 39 days.

264
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,483
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

265
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,586
Hey, it's "Mr. Be All You Can Be".

266
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:19,588
What's up, doc?

267
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,131
Not much. How are you?

268
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:23,050
I'm good.

269
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,430
Got a question about that
song, "Be All You Can Be".

270
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,393
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

271
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,061
I mean, I think it's logical.

272
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:39,358
This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?

273
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:41,819
You got to change
the record in our head.

274
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:43,612
You gotta start thinking
about other things.

275
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,364
Okay.
Stop obsessing... Right now.

276
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,742
What are you thinking about?

277
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,869
You want to know
what I'm thinking about, doc? Yeah.

278
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,122
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

279
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,253
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.

280
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:02,090
Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.

281
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,926
He's dead. He's alive.

282
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,518
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

283
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:14,811
Come on. You want the cool shit?

284
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,563
Come on, come on.
It's the tight shit, man.

285
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:19,065
Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?

286
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,109
Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.

287
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:22,902
New releases. Look.

288
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,447
Hello. Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good. Very good.

289
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:26,531
How much?

290
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:28,033
One for five and two for nine.

291
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,200
Three for twelve.

292
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,162
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax. Very good, man. Look.

293
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:34,080
- Look...
- No tax?

294
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,999
All right. What do you got?
What do you got.

295
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:39,544
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.

296
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,212
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

297
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:44,883
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?

298
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,469
- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?

299
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:49,637
- Yeah. The best shit, man.
- Okay.

300
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,348
Here you go,
I'll take one.

301
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:53,266
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

302
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,267
Want a cigarette?

303
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:56,645
Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.

304
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,148
Thank you. Take it easy.

305
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:09,282
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.

306
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,284
What's that?

307
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:15,163
- Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.

308
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:17,540
Wasn't cool.

309
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:22,295
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.

310
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:27,759
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.

311
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:31,638
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.

312
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:36,851
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

313
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:43,274
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck trailer trash like you.

314
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,112
Looks like you're on the right track.

315
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,365
We'll see you out there.

316
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,961
Let's go, move!

317
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:12,345
Shit. Get out of the way. Move.

318
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,684
Hallo.

319
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,229
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.

320
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:23,690
- All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?

321
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,858
No, I didn't look.

322
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:25,984
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

323
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:28,361
Car has been parked illegally.

324
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,531
The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk.

325
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:34,951
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.

326
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,038
You want me to go close to it?

327
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,333
Yeah. No-no. I don't. I'm kidding.

328
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:34,928
Shit.

329
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,680
It's coming from over here!

330
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:44,437
Blaster One. You there?

331
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:51,945
Blaster One, you hear me?

332
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:54,864
Here.

333
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,123
Shit.

334
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,210
Let's go, guys.

335
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:10,422
Let it go.

336
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,549
I got top cover.

337
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,717
That's a negative, specialist.

338
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,093
Eldridge, you stay with me.

339
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:16,678
Sanborn, you take top covers.

340
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:17,637
Shit.

341
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,095
Blaster Mike in position.

342
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:25,538
What do you got?

343
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:28,375
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.

344
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,377
He's not going to make it.

345
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,671
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

346
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,172
Got a survival wound, sir.

347
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:36,925
He's not going to make it.

348
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:06,579
Oh, God.

349
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:19,718
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

350
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,265
What are you doing?

351
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,434
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

352
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:31,313
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.

353
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,398
I need my kit and my cans.

354
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,275
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

355
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:38,611
I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.

356
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,415
Kit and cans.

357
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,977
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.

358
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,831
I'm looking for this initiating system.

359
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,320
Well, it's not in the back seat.

360
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,241
I don't think.

361
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,840
All right. It's not in the back seat.

362
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:33,144
Got a young man on the roof,
your 9:00, keep an eye on him.

363
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,312
Roger that.

364
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:43,654
It's not in the front seat.

365
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,454
It's not in the door.

366
00:36:58,002 --> 00:36:59,086
Not on the floors.

367
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:04,884
Not in the glove box.

368
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:07,636
If you haven't found it yet.
it's probably under the car.

369
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:11,515
Yeah. No wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

370
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:20,399
- Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.

371
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:23,444
You got eyes on some guy.
with a video camera?

372
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,528
No. Where?

373
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:28,491
He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me.

374
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:40,044
Shit.

375
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:41,420
Negative, I don't see him.

376
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:45,299
Hey, Sanborn. He's right
at my 12:00. Look! 12:00!

377
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,718
Roger that, I got him.

378
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:54,308
Getting ready to put me on You Tube.

379
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:56,102
Little shady.

380
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:58,062
Yeah, he looks shady.
Keep and eye on him.

381
00:37:58,354 --> 00:37:59,939
Okay. So, what's the play?

382
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:03,734
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

383
00:38:10,908 --> 00:38:12,201
Got more wire.

384
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:19,458
Leads fucking nowhere.

385
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:22,336
Fuck!

386
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:24,839
Hey, James, how you doing?

387
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,217
I'm wonderful. How are you?

388
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,927
You know, we've been here a while.

389
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:33,139
We need to get out of here soon.

390
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:34,223
Uh-huh.

391
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:42,023
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

392
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:46,694
Roger that. I'm going
to figure this out.

393
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,739
James, we need to get out of here.

394
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:52,908
James, do you copy?

395
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,286
Fuck it. I get it.

396
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,915
Fuck me.

397
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:09,133
Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?

398
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,134
All clear.

399
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,054
James, the evac
is complete. We can leave.

400
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:14,555
Let the engineers handle this mess.

401
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,724
- We moving?
- That's affirmative.

402
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,114
Interesting.

403
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:34,241
What's up with James?
He's not answering.

404
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,495
Yeah, I think he removed his headset.

405
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:41,582
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

406
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,250
Hey, James!

407
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,463
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.

408
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:55,971
Uh... that's a negative.

409
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,140
That, yeah, that's not going to happen.

410
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,326
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00.

411
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:39,348
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

412
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,142
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

413
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,890
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

414
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:22,642
This is real bad man.

415
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:24,143
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

416
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,067
I can't see James from here.

417
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:32,485
Get down now!

418
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,241
We can go!

419
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:47,041
Bastard.

420
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,358
We're done.

421
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:17,613
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

422
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:33,671
Woo.

423
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:47,393
That was good.

424
00:42:58,112 --> 00:42:59,655
- Hey, James.
- What?

425
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,076
Never turn your headset off again.

426
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,521
You the guy in the bomb suit?

427
00:43:32,147 --> 00:43:34,816
No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.

428
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:36,818
- Hey. James.
- Yeah?

429
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,487
Someone's here to see you.

430
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:42,574
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?

431
00:43:42,574 --> 00:43:44,368
Afternoon, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.

432
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:48,163
Well, that's just hot shit.

433
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,415
You're a wild man, you know that?

434
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:52,918
- Uh, yes, sir.
- He's a wild man.

435
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:54,127
You know that?

436
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:56,254
I want to shake your hand.

437
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:58,173
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

438
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:00,884
How many bombs have you disarmed?

439
00:44:01,802 --> 00:44:02,928
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

440
00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:04,221
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

441
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:05,472
I asked you a question.

442
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:08,684
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

443
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:12,688
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

444
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,315
That's just hot shit.

445
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:17,234
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

446
00:44:17,985 --> 00:44:19,987
- Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.

447
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:26,868
What's the best way to... go about
disarming one of these things?

448
00:44:28,328 --> 00:44:29,788
The way you don't die, sir.

449
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,749
That's a good one.

450
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:35,752
That's spoken
like a wild man. That's good.

451
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,063
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute.

452
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:56,440
Look who it is.

453
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,443
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

454
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,737
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?

455
00:45:01,737 --> 00:45:03,739
Yeah. The DVD you sold me was crap.

456
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:06,908
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.

457
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:08,535
No. It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.

458
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:10,037
- What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.

459
00:45:10,037 --> 00:45:12,247
- Girls on dog?
- Gay sex, man?

460
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:13,707
Anything you want, you get.

461
00:45:13,707 --> 00:45:16,001
I hook you up, man.

462
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,878
All right. What... what's your name?

463
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:20,005
- Beckham.
- Beckham like the soccer player?

464
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:22,132
Yeah, man. It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.

465
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:23,342
Are you a soccer player?

466
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:26,386
Yeah, man. Best of the best.
I'm better than Beckham.

467
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:27,179
You play goalie?

468
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,722
- Yes, I play goalie.
- Okay.

469
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:33,393
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the
ball, I'm going to give you five bucks,

470
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:35,979
- but if you can't...
- And what if... what if I can't?

471
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:39,191
Listen to me. If I score,
I'm going to keep your ball.

472
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:40,567
- Deal?
- Deal.

473
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:43,570
Get up there.

474
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,290
Go on.

475
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:52,496
- Let's see what you got hot stuff.
- Are you ready?

476
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:54,289
On three. Ready?

477
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,751
One, two, three. Aahh!

478
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,255
Shit.

479
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:04,049
Come on. Where's the five dollars?
Man, come on.

480
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:06,593
All right, I got ya.
Good job, dude.

481
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:08,929
Here's five.

482
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:11,390
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.

483
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,432
That's right.

484
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:13,558
It's fun, no?

485
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:15,227
It's cool? It's gangster.

486
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:18,772
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

487
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:21,984
Tell you what, I'm going to buy...

488
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,529
Let me see if I have
enough money, yeah. Five.

489
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:28,365
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

490
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:33,203
But if it's shakey... look at me...
or out of focus...

491
00:46:33,912 --> 00:46:35,831
or any way not 100%.

492
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:39,167
I'm going to chop off your goddammed
head with a dull knife.

493
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:41,586
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.

494
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:46,133
Here. You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?

495
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:48,635
Owen.

496
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:50,929
Hi.

497
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:52,222
- Hi, sir.
- How are you?

498
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:54,391
- I'm good.
- Good.

499
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:57,144
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking.

500
00:46:57,811 --> 00:46:59,938
Don't trust the mechanics
around here. You know.

501
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:03,275
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

502
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:05,110
I just want to check the oil.

503
00:47:05,944 --> 00:47:08,530
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

504
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:11,491
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.

505
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,951
Good to hear it.

506
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:16,204
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

507
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:23,086
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.

508
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:26,757
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.

509
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,508
He's going to get me killed,

510
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:30,594
almost died yesterday.

511
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,515
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.

512
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:38,101
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.

513
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:41,772
Going to war is a- is a once
in a lifetime experience.

514
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,315
It could be fun.

515
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:46,360
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

516
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,861
I've done my field duty.

517
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:50,030
Where's that? Yale?

518
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,868
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

519
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:56,244
These talks are voluntary.

520
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,038
Look, I'm sorry,

521
00:47:58,997 --> 00:48:01,249
I appreciate
what you're saying, I do.

522
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,126
I appreciate our sessions together,

523
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:07,964
but you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.

524
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:09,508
Well,

525
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:12,135
if this circumstance calls for it,
I will.

526
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:13,887
Just like every other soldier

527
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,812
Fire in the hole!

528
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,188
Firing now.

529
00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:29,861
Eee, ooh...

530
00:48:30,153 --> 00:48:31,989
- Ready for second det?
- Ready.

531
00:48:32,698 --> 00:48:36,076
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole.

532
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:37,619
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

533
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:41,623
Goddamn it,
I think I forgot my gloves down there.

534
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,625
- What?
- I forgot my gloves.

535
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:44,960
Hang on.

536
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:21,913
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.

537
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:24,541
What are you doing?

538
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,919
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.

539
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:33,050
He'd be obliterated to nothing.

540
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:36,762
His helmet would be left.
You could have that.

541
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:39,848
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.

542
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:43,060
Yeah. There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,

543
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:45,187
bits of hair.

544
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:49,816
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

545
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:52,402
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

546
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:57,240
You'd have to write the report.

547
00:49:59,993 --> 00:50:02,287
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.

548
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,166
No. I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

549
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:49,334
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.

550
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,336
I got four armed men.

551
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:53,338
They're in Haji gear.

552
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:56,675
All right. Go slow and easy.

553
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:06,518
Careful now.

554
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:11,565
All right. Careful now, guys.

555
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:14,276
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got them.

556
00:51:14,526 --> 00:51:17,863
"Obre... obre..."
put your gun down!

557
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:21,700
On your knees!
Put your gun down!

558
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,912
- Obre, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands.

559
00:51:24,912 --> 00:51:27,081
Get down, motherfucker. Obre!

560
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:29,792
Put your gun down now!

561
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:37,342
Put your gun down!

562
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:43,056
Advance, advance...

563
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:04,619
Hands high.

564
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:07,580
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you.

565
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,875
Pistol, off your hip, now.

566
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,335
What you want me to do?

567
00:52:12,335 --> 00:52:14,087
Keep
my hands up or take off the pistol?

568
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:18,299
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

569
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:25,306
Easy, easy.

570
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:26,891
Got it!

571
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:30,770
Can I touch my fucking head now?

572
00:52:32,605 --> 00:52:33,439
Slowly.

573
00:52:41,072 --> 00:52:43,408
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

574
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:45,743
Jesus.

575
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,538
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

576
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:51,666
Well, this is no place for a picnic.
What are you guys doing here?

577
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,501
We have a flat tire.
Can you help us?

578
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,169
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

579
00:52:55,169 --> 00:52:57,171
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.

580
00:52:57,422 --> 00:52:58,715
How do you use up a wrench?

581
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:01,467
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head.

582
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:02,593
He threw it at someone.

583
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:05,221
- All right.
- Thank you.

584
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:12,228
That's Chris. This is the wrench man.

585
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:14,689
Hello, wrench man. That's Jimmy.

586
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:17,150
You know, you can shoot people here.
You don't have to throw a wrench at them.

587
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,151
Fuck off.

588
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:29,245
Take a look at this.

589
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:31,831
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

590
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:35,501
Nine of hearts, that's one.

591
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:39,213
And the other...
jack of clubs.

592
00:53:44,218 --> 00:53:46,054
- These the same guys?
- Yep. That's them.

593
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:50,892
Does he need a little help there?

594
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:53,311
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on.

595
00:53:55,813 --> 00:53:58,149
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.

596
00:53:58,483 --> 00:53:59,817
All right, solutions? Anyone?

597
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:02,445
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check.

598
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:03,905
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.

599
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:06,866
How long you guys out here?

600
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,577
Specialist, what do we got?

601
00:54:10,703 --> 00:54:16,084
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah.

602
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:19,962
No one's counting.

603
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:25,093
Contact left.

604
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,980
Take cover,

605
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:40,108
Chris, take the 50, Jimmy,
take that in the Humvee.

606
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:41,651
- Got it.
- Come on!

607
00:54:55,732 --> 00:54:56,650
Charlie, go!

608
00:54:57,985 --> 00:54:59,444
Go, go, go!

609
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:07,869
We need more ammo.

610
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:11,707
Look inside.
Take all the go-bags, Jimmy.

611
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:16,586
- What are we shooting at?
- I don't know.

612
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:18,463
Fuck. The packages are gone!

613
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:19,881
They won't get far on foot.

614
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:23,176
Bring them back those fuckers now.
I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds.

615
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:37,399
I forgot,

616
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:39,818
it's 500,000 dead or alive.

617
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:46,158
- Okay, Jimmy, give me the Barret.
- Okay.

618
00:55:48,368 --> 00:55:49,453
I can't see a thing.

619
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:52,581
Come on!

620
00:55:58,128 --> 00:56:00,714
Chris is shooting wild.
Gotta conserve the ammo.

621
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:02,049
Hey. Chris can you hear me?

622
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:06,762
Hey. Chris! Chris! Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50!

623
00:56:07,012 --> 00:56:07,929
Roger that.

624
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,601
- Fifty's down.
- They shot Chris.

625
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,530
It must be coming from that building.

626
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,782
I can't see anything.

627
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:32,996
Movement on the roof.

628
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:47,928
Yeah?

629
00:56:48,428 --> 00:56:49,554
Three meters higher.

630
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:53,767
I'm going to adjust.

631
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:23,380
Fuck

632
00:57:24,006 --> 00:57:26,216
Fuck, he's dead.

633
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,010
We've got to get out of here now!

634
00:57:28,218 --> 00:57:28,719
Damn it.

635
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,512
This is Alpha Nine.
We're in deep shit.

636
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:31,763
I'll get on the Barret.

637
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:32,681
Go, go, go.

638
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,349
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

639
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:35,309
Go, go, go.

640
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:37,477
- No. Sanborn, don't come up here.
- Got it!

641
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:39,271
Go, buddy. Stay low!
Stay low!

642
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:40,355
I have two KIA,

643
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:44,693
correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...

644
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:46,069
Stay low!

645
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:47,279
Can you get me some help?

646
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,116
- Behind you.
- Yeah.

647
00:58:08,091 --> 00:58:09,301
Breathe easy.

648
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:13,096
- I got movement.
- Yeah.

649
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,182
On the ridge of that house

650
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,063
Eight hundred and fifty meters.

651
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:23,649
- See it.
- By the window.

652
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:28,236
- You got target.
- Got it.

653
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:36,745
All right, here little left.

654
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:39,122
Just breathe easy.

655
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:50,384
- I'm out of ammo.
- Hmm?

656
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,427
I'm out of ammo.

657
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:55,013
Eldridge, we need ammo.

658
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:00,477
Where is it?

659
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:03,146
Check on the dead guy, man.

660
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:04,523
It's on the dead man.

661
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:12,114
Eldridge!

662
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:13,448
I'm looking.

663
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:18,204
We need that ammo, man.

664
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:19,539
All right, man.

665
00:59:21,332 --> 00:59:22,500
Oh, here.

666
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:26,629
Thanks.

667
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,269
All right. Got it.

668
00:59:41,269 --> 00:59:42,812
Same target.

669
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,483
It's fucking jammed.

670
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,235
Let me see it.

671
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:52,363
Fuck!

672
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:57,243
Aw, shit. The blood's
making it jam. Eldridge.

673
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:58,786
Shit!

674
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:01,080
You gotta clean the blood off, man.
It's making them jam.

675
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,498
Specialist!

676
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:06,919
- Clean the blood off.
- Okay.

677
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:14,761
Clean it. Clean it.

678
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,763
You gotta clean it, man.

679
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,598
- How?
- Spit and rub.

680
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:22,894
All right.

681
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:26,272
Spit and rub, buddy.
Spit and rub.

682
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,320
It's not working. It's not coming off.

683
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:40,286
Spit and rub. Spit and rub.
Here, take it out.

684
01:00:42,664 --> 01:00:44,457
Use your camel. Use your camel.
Where is it?

685
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,751
You all right?

686
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:48,127
Here, use that.

687
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:53,091
Just breathe, buddy.

688
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:54,550
Come on. Just breathe in.

689
01:00:54,842 --> 01:00:56,886
Good. Here, squeeze.

690
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,472
- Got it?
- Yeah.

691
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,559
Rub that ojive, baby.
Come on. You got it.

692
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:14,946
You're doing good, man.
You're doing real good.

693
01:01:17,198 --> 01:01:18,741
-Got them?
- Yeah.

694
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,369
I'm going to keep
you safe, buddy, all right?

695
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:23,371
Now let's get these bastards.
Scan your sectors.

696
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:24,872
Scan your sectors.

697
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,590
Kill that fucking asshole.

698
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:37,969
Son of a bitch.

699
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,442
Nice. He's down.

700
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:55,361
Twenty meters to
the right of the building.

701
01:02:00,825 --> 01:02:01,784
I got him.

702
01:02:04,537 --> 01:02:05,705
Fire when ready.

703
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,090
He's moving. He's moving.
To the building.

704
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,593
- Follow him. You got him?
- Got him.

705
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:24,390
He's down.

706
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:29,437
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

707
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:41,532
Window.
The window. At the window.

708
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:48,247
He's still there.

709
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,391
Left window.
Left window. Got him?

710
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:07,600
Got him.

711
01:03:27,328 --> 01:03:28,329
He's down.

712
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:28,306
- Hey, Owen.
- Yeah?

713
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,893
Can you grab the juice
out of the pack please?

714
01:04:31,893 --> 01:04:32,810
Sure.

715
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:46,741
I think we're out.

716
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,620
- Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one.

717
01:05:11,432 --> 01:05:12,350
Thank you.

718
01:05:38,793 --> 01:05:41,462
Drink. Drink it.

719
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:47,028
Things are real quiet.

720
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,073
Yeah, I don't like it.

721
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:13,013
- Hey. Will?
- Yeah?

722
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,933
At your six o'clock

723
01:07:16,558 --> 01:07:19,645
I see movement on the bridge.
Right on the tracks.

724
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:23,023
Well, handle it.

725
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:28,988
Should I fire?

726
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:31,573
It's your call, buddy.

727
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,271
Good job.

728
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:34,011
Hey, Sanborn,

729
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:39,975
I think we're done.

730
01:08:53,572 --> 01:08:55,115
Okay? You all right?

731
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:00,996
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

732
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:06,043
- Man.
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

733
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:07,962
Owen.

734
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:10,589
Another round, boy.
That's your order.

735
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:12,883
Well, yes, sir. Sgt. James, sir.

736
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:14,718
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?

737
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,428
But you're a good warrior.
Give me your mug.

738
01:09:17,846 --> 01:09:18,681
There ya go, sir.

739
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:21,725
You were well on the field
of battle today, specialist.

740
01:09:22,434 --> 01:09:23,519
Cheers.

741
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:33,153
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

742
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:41,328
- I was scared.
- Yeah?

743
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:45,165
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know.

744
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,504
You're good. You're real good.

745
01:09:50,504 --> 01:09:52,381
Just what do we have here?

746
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:55,926
Will has possessions.

747
01:09:57,094 --> 01:09:59,013
I didn't know you owned anything. Will.

748
01:09:59,013 --> 01:10:00,681
Let's see what you got here. Will.

749
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:04,184
Who is that?

750
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:05,728
That's my son.

751
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:10,816
He's a tough little bastard.
Nothing like me.

752
01:10:10,816 --> 01:10:12,776
You mean to tell me you married?

753
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:18,115
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...

754
01:10:18,407 --> 01:10:21,327
...she got pregnant,
so we got married.

755
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:23,495
We got divorced.

756
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:28,083
Or I thought we got divorced.

757
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:31,545
She's still living in the house.
And she says we're still together,

758
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,215
so I don't know.
What does that make her?

759
01:10:35,549 --> 01:10:38,969
Dumb for still being with your ass.

760
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:41,889
Hey.

761
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:43,432
She ain't fucking dumb,
all right?

762
01:10:43,724 --> 01:10:44,933
She's just loyal.

763
01:10:46,769 --> 01:10:49,355
She's just loyal. That's all.
How about you guys?

764
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:53,692
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?

765
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:57,571
My only problem is the girl I do like.

766
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:00,866
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man.

767
01:11:01,075 --> 01:11:03,035
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

768
01:11:04,036 --> 01:11:05,412
Go on. Do it.

769
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:08,040
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.
- No. Hell no.

770
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,083
Make babies.

771
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,586
I know when I'm ready, and I
ain't ready for that yet, I know that.

772
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,840
Well, well...
what do we have here?

773
01:11:18,467 --> 01:11:19,885
Uh, components.

774
01:11:21,178 --> 01:11:23,430
They're bomb parts. Signatures.

775
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,516
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?

776
01:11:28,477 --> 01:11:29,687
Well...

777
01:11:36,527 --> 01:11:37,528
Ah-ha.

778
01:11:37,528 --> 01:11:39,113
There we go. This one.

779
01:11:39,905 --> 01:11:43,575
This one is from the U.N. building.

780
01:11:43,575 --> 01:11:47,329
Flaming car.
Dead man's switch. Boom.

781
01:11:47,705 --> 01:11:49,164
This guy was good, I like him.

782
01:11:50,749 --> 01:11:52,626
- Relay.
- Ah... look at this one.

783
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:57,673
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together.

784
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:02,970
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me.

785
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:04,847
And what about this one?

786
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:07,266
- Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring.

787
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:10,185
Like I said,
stuff that almost killed me.

788
01:12:11,687 --> 01:12:16,066
You know, I just think
it's really interested

789
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:17,443
to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone.

790
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:21,238
Damn that. It's all shit
from radio shack.

791
01:12:23,866 --> 01:12:24,992
It's interesting.

792
01:12:25,784 --> 01:12:27,244
I think it's interesting too.

793
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:29,038
Well, I think you hit me harder than
I hit you

794
01:12:29,038 --> 01:12:32,207
therefore I owe you a punch.

795
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:34,001
Now get your ass up, C'mon.

796
01:12:34,335 --> 01:12:37,254
C'mon. He's right.
Let's go. C'mon.

797
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:39,840
Come on!

798
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,717
All right, hold on, boys.
We need some rules.

799
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:43,677
Sanborn, no face shots.

800
01:12:43,677 --> 01:12:44,720
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

801
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,180
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

802
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:48,307
Yes, sir.

803
01:12:48,974 --> 01:12:49,975
What happened?

804
01:12:50,309 --> 01:12:52,186
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby.

805
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:54,229
Looks like frag scars.

806
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:58,359
- Let it go, Eldridge. C'mon.
- All right.

807
01:12:58,734 --> 01:13:00,194
Nice and big.

808
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,325
Oohh!

809
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:15,334
You like that, huh?

810
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:17,044
That's all you got?

811
01:13:17,628 --> 01:13:18,796
Come on.

812
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:23,175
Bring some. C'mon.

813
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,178
Ooh!

814
01:13:29,598 --> 01:13:32,685
Wooh. God damn.

815
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:34,645
That's gotta hurt.

816
01:13:38,357 --> 01:13:39,817
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah.

817
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,737
- Oh, he's all right.
- Get up, bitch.

818
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:47,199
All right, bitch.

819
01:13:50,536 --> 01:13:52,246
- What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me?

820
01:13:52,246 --> 01:13:53,956
- What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker.

821
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:55,833
What do you got? What do you got?

822
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,961
Wooh, he's a wild one.
We got a wild one.

823
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:01,046
C'mon, Sanborn.
Get him. That's right.

824
01:14:01,046 --> 01:14:04,800
- Ride him, baby.
- Get off me.

825
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,510
- C'mon, bitch.
- C'mon, guys.

826
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,304
What do you got?

827
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:10,014
Get off me.

828
01:14:10,222 --> 01:14:11,348
Hey, hey, hey,

829
01:14:22,651 --> 01:14:24,611
I'm just kidding,
motherfucker. Shit.

830
01:14:26,905 --> 01:14:28,365
You're all right, Sanborn.

831
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:29,575
You're all right. Man.

832
01:14:29,575 --> 01:14:31,869
Owen, get this guy a drink. C'mon.

833
01:14:33,704 --> 01:14:35,080
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

834
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,498
- All right, here.
- All right.

835
01:14:36,498 --> 01:14:37,207
See you later.

836
01:14:37,207 --> 01:14:38,375
- Be safe.
- All right.

837
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:41,712
All right, come on big boy.
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

838
01:14:42,171 --> 01:14:44,381
He hurt his knee. C'mon, man.

839
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:48,802
Steps. C'mon.

840
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:52,514
Step. Step.

841
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:02,484
All right, lay down.
All right. Get some rest.

842
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:08,114
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?

843
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:11,743
Hell, no.

844
01:15:13,495 --> 01:15:14,955
Night, boy.

845
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:09,926
Oh!

846
01:16:14,306 --> 01:16:16,016
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

847
01:16:16,808 --> 01:16:21,062
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time.

848
01:16:24,024 --> 01:16:26,067
That'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.

849
01:16:30,488 --> 01:16:31,573
Hey. Doc.

850
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,117
Not to insult your intelligence, sir,

851
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:37,370
but if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.

852
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,290
The round will just bounce around,
and someone might get shot.

853
01:16:40,957 --> 01:16:43,960
- I don't like getting shot.
- Understood. Sergeant.

854
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:57,974
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

855
01:16:57,974 --> 01:17:00,101
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.

856
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:03,438
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is,

857
01:17:04,064 --> 01:17:06,107
and then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes.

858
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:08,485
- We've gotta gear up.
- For what?

859
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:09,819
Security hasn't gone in.

860
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,488
Go in quiet.

861
01:17:11,488 --> 01:17:12,113
Radios off.

862
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:13,448
- Roger.
- Roger that.

863
01:17:14,157 --> 01:17:16,201
- Glad you came.
- See ya. All right.

864
01:20:09,207 --> 01:20:10,458
Psst. Psst.

865
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,845
Clear.

866
01:20:23,096 --> 01:20:23,930
Hey,

867
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:25,974
cigarette's still smoking.

868
01:20:29,978 --> 01:20:31,146
It's all our shit.

869
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,526
Mother fucking goldmine.

870
01:20:38,445 --> 01:20:39,904
Watch out for trips.

871
01:21:04,095 --> 01:21:05,180
I got something.

872
01:21:18,693 --> 01:21:19,944
I know this kid.

873
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:23,365
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs.

874
01:21:24,282 --> 01:21:26,159
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

875
01:21:28,912 --> 01:21:31,206
It's disgusting. Let's get out of here.

876
01:21:31,915 --> 01:21:32,832
Hold it.

877
01:21:34,334 --> 01:21:39,381
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on.

878
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:44,302
Let's get all this
ordinance out of here.

879
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:46,429
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.

880
01:21:47,681 --> 01:21:49,057
Roger. Just blow it.

881
01:21:57,941 --> 01:21:58,858
What are you doing?

882
01:22:00,443 --> 01:22:02,737
Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move.

883
01:22:04,364 --> 01:22:05,490
Yeah. That's really wonderful,

884
01:22:06,408 --> 01:22:07,867
but it's
a little bit unsafe today.

885
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:11,955
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

886
01:22:11,955 --> 01:22:13,415
So maybe... I don't know.

887
01:22:13,748 --> 01:22:17,002
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

888
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:18,044
No?

889
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:36,187
Fuck.

890
01:22:41,192 --> 01:22:42,235
- You all right?
- Yeah.

891
01:22:42,235 --> 01:22:43,528
- You?
- Yeah.

892
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,786
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

893
01:22:52,996 --> 01:22:54,206
No one in or out, okay?

894
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:38,417
Cancel the det. Cancel the det.

895
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:02,900
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man.

896
01:24:05,152 --> 01:24:06,112
I don't know.

897
01:25:34,784 --> 01:25:35,785
I'm coming out.

898
01:25:36,994 --> 01:25:38,120
Roger that.

899
01:25:58,724 --> 01:26:00,518
- Where are you from?
- New York.

900
01:26:00,893 --> 01:26:02,061
The Big Apple.

901
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,146
Are you from Iraq?

902
01:26:04,146 --> 01:26:06,440
I love it here.
This is a beautiful place.

903
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,859
But it's not too safe here, okay?

904
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:12,571
So, I think we need -
we need to move. Please.

905
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:38,347
You think it's that little Beckham?

906
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:40,057
No, I don't.

907
01:26:40,641 --> 01:26:42,935
- You're positive?
- Sure.

908
01:26:43,644 --> 01:26:45,938
Hey, I don't know, man
They all look the same, right?

909
01:26:46,605 --> 01:26:47,481
I know.

910
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:50,901
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.
- Very weird.

911
01:26:53,321 --> 01:26:55,781
Please, just move.

912
01:26:56,115 --> 01:26:58,451
Move. Move.

913
01:26:58,451 --> 01:27:03,080
Move on. Thank you.

914
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:07,585
I'm sorry.

915
01:27:08,419 --> 01:27:09,795
Will's very weird.

916
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:12,298
I mean he keeps bomb
parts under his bed.

917
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,468
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed.

918
01:27:17,678 --> 01:27:18,638
Bye-bye.

919
01:27:20,514 --> 01:27:22,892
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye. Thank you.

920
01:27:23,809 --> 01:27:24,894
Hey, Colonel.

921
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:26,604
Let's go.

922
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:29,023
Hallo, thank you.

923
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:37,698
IED!

924
01:27:39,325 --> 01:27:40,326
Cambridge!

925
01:27:45,289 --> 01:27:46,749
Get back. Get down.

926
01:27:46,749 --> 01:27:48,334
Stay back.

927
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:50,378
Stay back. Sanborn, keep them back.

928
01:27:51,253 --> 01:27:52,046
Is anyone hurt?

929
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:54,674
Cambridge! Fuck!

930
01:27:55,508 --> 01:27:56,968
Cambridge!

931
01:27:57,969 --> 01:27:59,637
Cambridge, come out.
We gotta go.

932
01:27:59,637 --> 01:28:00,763
Oh, he's dead.

933
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:04,183
Hey, we gotta find
Cambridge, Doc!

934
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:06,894
- Eldridge!
- Doc!

935
01:28:07,895 --> 01:28:10,481
Eldridge, c'mon, man. C'mon

936
01:28:10,481 --> 01:28:12,566
I just saw him.
He was walking right here.

937
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:15,903
I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead. Okay?

938
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:31,168
It's all right, man.

939
01:28:31,168 --> 01:28:33,296
It'll be all right, man.

940
01:28:56,986 --> 01:28:57,903
Hello?

941
01:29:00,156 --> 01:29:01,198
Hello?

942
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:03,284
Will?

943
01:29:05,494 --> 01:29:06,412
Hello?

944
01:29:09,707 --> 01:29:11,167
Hello?

945
01:30:02,927 --> 01:30:04,220
Hey, let me ask you a question.

946
01:30:04,553 --> 01:30:07,223
What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?

947
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:10,810
Sorry, man.
English I... no English.

948
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:14,146
No-no English.
You no speak English now.

949
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:17,400
Little kid. Beckham is his name.
He sells... sells DVDs.

950
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,194
DVD. One DVD, $5.

951
01:30:20,194 --> 01:30:21,612
Oh, Jesus Christ.

952
01:30:21,988 --> 01:30:23,489
- $5.
- Excuse me, soldier,

953
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:24,907
you in charge of this area here?

954
01:30:24,907 --> 01:30:26,951
- What's up?
- You know this guy?

955
01:30:28,077 --> 01:30:30,246
How do we know
that he's not giving intel

956
01:30:30,246 --> 01:30:31,872
to insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?

957
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:33,457
I think he's just selling DVDs.

958
01:30:33,457 --> 01:30:35,126
Well, he's a security risk.
We should get rid of him.

959
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:37,128
What are you looking at?

960
01:30:37,128 --> 01:30:39,672
He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are clear.

961
01:30:39,672 --> 01:30:40,631
By who?

962
01:30:40,631 --> 01:30:42,883
I couldn't do anything with him
until I got the clear from my CO.

963
01:30:45,761 --> 01:30:46,763
Okay. Fuck.

964
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,933
Fuck.

965
01:31:25,969 --> 01:31:27,346
Does this change anything?

966
01:31:28,597 --> 01:31:29,765
You speak
English now. Don't you?

967
01:31:30,849 --> 01:31:32,476
- Yalla, yalla. Drive.
- Okay.

968
01:31:54,414 --> 01:31:56,208
- Ok.
- Is this his house?

969
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:57,960
He there?

970
01:32:06,843 --> 01:32:07,678
Wait here.

971
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:18,689
Fuck.

972
01:33:17,748 --> 01:33:19,458
Psst. Psst. Shh.

973
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:21,835
You speak English?

974
01:33:22,085 --> 01:33:23,837
English. French. Arabic.

975
01:33:23,837 --> 01:33:25,005
Good. Open you vest.

976
01:33:26,465 --> 01:33:28,258
Ah, stay there. Stay.

977
01:33:29,051 --> 01:33:30,510
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

978
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:31,928
For whom?

979
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:35,432
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there.

980
01:33:36,141 --> 01:33:38,185
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

981
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:41,521
But please, sit down,
I am Professor Navid.

982
01:33:41,897 --> 01:33:43,148
This is my home.

983
01:33:43,774 --> 01:33:46,860
You are a guest.
Please, sit down.

984
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:50,906
I'm a guest.

985
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:57,287
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible

986
01:33:58,747 --> 01:34:00,457
for-for-for Beckham.

987
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:03,293
You are CIA, no?

988
01:34:04,628 --> 01:34:06,922
I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home.

989
01:34:07,673 --> 01:34:09,383
Please, sit.

990
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,225
How can I...

991
01:34:22,813 --> 01:34:24,314
Be careful. The gun can go off.

992
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:23,248
U.S.A. friendly coming in.

993
01:35:23,248 --> 01:35:26,168
Stop. Stop. Get the fuck down.

994
01:35:26,168 --> 01:35:27,628
U.S.A. friendly.

995
01:35:27,628 --> 01:35:30,172
On your knees.
Get on your knees now.

996
01:35:30,172 --> 01:35:34,343
On your knees.
You will be shot. Don't move.

997
01:35:34,343 --> 01:35:36,094
On your knees. Down now.

998
01:35:36,094 --> 01:35:39,723
- Open your jacket!
- Opening my jacket.

999
01:35:39,723 --> 01:35:41,600
Cover. Get him down.

1000
01:35:41,808 --> 01:35:43,060
- On the ground.
- I have a weapon.

1001
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,853
Don't fucking move.

1002
01:35:45,312 --> 01:35:47,022
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.
- I have a weapon.

1003
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:50,359
- Gun.
- Like I said.

1004
01:35:51,777 --> 01:35:52,986
Weapons clear.

1005
01:35:53,362 --> 01:35:54,279
ID.

1006
01:35:55,113 --> 01:35:56,365
What the fuck are you doing?

1007
01:35:56,657 --> 01:35:58,033
I was at a whorehouse.

1008
01:35:58,867 --> 01:36:03,747
All right. If I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?

1009
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:06,625
Yeah.

1010
01:36:08,835 --> 01:36:10,879
James, do you copy?

1011
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:22,057
James do you have your ears on?

1012
01:36:25,894 --> 01:36:26,728
James?

1013
01:36:28,814 --> 01:36:30,190
This is James. What's up?

1014
01:36:45,998 --> 01:36:48,125
- Hey.
- What's up, man?

1015
01:36:51,128 --> 01:36:53,338
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.

1016
01:36:53,338 --> 01:36:55,048
We have to post-blast assessment,

1017
01:36:55,048 --> 01:36:56,508
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1018
01:36:56,508 --> 01:36:58,176
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1019
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:00,053
Okay.

1020
01:37:00,804 --> 01:37:02,014
Where'd you say you were again?

1021
01:37:02,681 --> 01:37:03,849
I didn't, sergeant.
Let's go.

1022
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:08,061
What happened to your head, James?

1023
01:37:15,652 --> 01:37:16,737
Hey, you ready?

1024
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:18,780
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1025
01:37:24,661 --> 01:37:26,580
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

1026
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,540
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1027
01:37:42,262 --> 01:37:44,139
U.S.A. friendlies coming through.

1028
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:06,453
Make room, guys. Make room.

1029
01:38:19,091 --> 01:38:21,051
Hey, Sanborn.

1030
01:38:21,885 --> 01:38:22,803
Oh, shit!

1031
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,040
- An oil tanker?
- Yep.

1032
01:38:54,627 --> 01:38:56,004
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1033
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,717
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1034
01:41:11,806 --> 01:41:13,182
Jesus.

1035
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:15,601
So, where's our triggerman?

1036
01:41:15,935 --> 01:41:17,562
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1037
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:19,564
Suicide bomber.

1038
01:41:20,064 --> 01:41:22,191
We're never going
to find a body in that shit.

1039
01:41:22,442 --> 01:41:23,860
What if there was no body?

1040
01:41:25,653 --> 01:41:27,030
What if it was a remote det?

1041
01:41:31,909 --> 01:41:34,287
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1042
01:41:37,498 --> 01:41:41,169
Right here.
Perfect vantage point,

1043
01:41:41,794 --> 01:41:45,923
outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.

1044
01:41:48,718 --> 01:41:50,428
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do.

1045
01:41:53,014 --> 01:41:55,350
I could stand to get in a little trouble.

1046
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,976
No, man. This is bullshit.

1047
01:41:57,310 --> 01:42:01,814
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji hunting.

1048
01:42:01,814 --> 01:42:03,024
That ain't our fucking job.

1049
01:42:03,024 --> 01:42:05,860
You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.

1050
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:08,029
You know there are guys
watching us right now.

1051
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:11,366
They're laughing at this.
Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1052
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:15,078
Now, turn off your goddammed
torch Because we're going.

1053
01:43:24,564 --> 01:43:26,357
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.

1054
01:43:26,357 --> 01:43:28,026
No shit. Same kind.

1055
01:43:28,026 --> 01:43:29,736
- We're close.
- Yeah.

1056
01:43:30,028 --> 01:43:31,821
They alleyways
are probably set up on a grid.

1057
01:43:31,821 --> 01:43:34,282
We're going to need
to split up, flush them out.

1058
01:43:35,074 --> 01:43:37,493
Sanborn, you take one.
Eldridge, take two.

1059
01:43:37,493 --> 01:43:40,538
I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.

1060
01:43:40,538 --> 01:43:41,956
- Ready, move.
- Wait, rally point when?

1061
01:43:43,207 --> 01:43:44,042
Fuck.

1062
01:44:10,693 --> 01:44:12,070
"Ipsura, ipsura,"
Go, go!

1063
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,659
Shit. Ahh.

1064
01:45:06,249 --> 01:45:07,083
Shit.

1065
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,377
- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?

1066
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:11,254
- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.

1067
01:45:12,797 --> 01:45:13,840
Go, go.

1068
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,383
Man down. Man down.

1069
01:45:16,676 --> 01:45:18,052
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1070
01:45:18,386 --> 01:45:21,139
- Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.

1071
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:22,849
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1072
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:24,809
Tankers and troops are that way.

1073
01:45:25,143 --> 01:45:26,602
- Let's go this way.
- Fuck.

1074
01:45:49,584 --> 01:45:51,794
Use your torch. On three.

1075
01:45:53,963 --> 01:45:54,881
Ready?

1076
01:45:55,673 --> 01:45:58,009
One, two, three. Fuck.

1077
01:46:00,386 --> 01:46:01,554
- Fuck!
- Shit.

1078
01:46:07,393 --> 01:46:09,020
Softly, softly, softly.

1079
01:46:20,406 --> 01:46:21,240
On three.

1080
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:23,451
One. Two. Three.

1081
01:46:27,789 --> 01:46:29,499
Now. Go, go, go.

1082
01:46:32,211 --> 01:46:35,130
- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude. I'm hit.

1083
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,049
Hit him in the fucking leg.

1084
01:46:37,049 --> 01:46:39,051
Come on.

1085
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:42,513
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No. You're fine, man.

1086
01:46:43,097 --> 01:46:44,807
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1087
01:46:46,475 --> 01:46:48,268
I'm going to put some
pressure down. Come on.

1088
01:46:48,727 --> 01:46:49,812
You're all right.

1089
01:46:51,021 --> 01:46:53,232
Look at me, look at me.
You all right.

1090
01:46:53,565 --> 01:46:57,778
All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three.

1091
01:48:20,486 --> 01:48:23,656
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1092
01:48:23,906 --> 01:48:25,866
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?

1093
01:48:27,409 --> 01:48:28,327
What's up?

1094
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,329
Come on, man.
Wanna play some...

1095
01:48:48,055 --> 01:48:50,015
Aww. Fuck.

1096
01:48:55,479 --> 01:48:56,397
How you doing, buddy?

1097
01:48:57,147 --> 01:48:58,691
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1098
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:01,527
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.

1099
01:49:02,778 --> 01:49:05,781
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.

1100
01:49:05,781 --> 01:49:08,200
- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?

1101
01:49:08,534 --> 01:49:10,286
Fucking sucks, man.

1102
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:12,079
- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy.

1103
01:49:14,206 --> 01:49:16,959
You see that? You fucking see that?

1104
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:20,587
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1105
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,298
Sorry.

1106
01:49:22,923 --> 01:49:24,967
- Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.

1107
01:49:25,426 --> 01:49:26,719
Really. Fuck you.

1108
01:49:27,803 --> 01:49:31,557
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go out

1109
01:49:31,557 --> 01:49:34,560
looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1110
01:49:36,645 --> 01:49:38,397
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1111
01:49:38,397 --> 01:49:39,940
Come home safe, man.

1112
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:42,067
- See you on the other side, man.
- All right.

1113
01:49:43,235 --> 01:49:45,195
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1114
01:49:51,368 --> 01:49:52,369
Don't move.

1115
01:49:52,369 --> 01:49:55,497
If you keep
walking we will shoot you.

1116
01:49:55,497 --> 01:49:57,291
Move him back.

1117
01:49:58,292 --> 01:49:59,793
Keep that translator back.

1118
01:49:59,793 --> 01:50:01,837
- But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back!

1119
01:50:01,837 --> 01:50:03,964
Don't move! Stay still.

1120
01:50:06,008 --> 01:50:10,137
If you keep walking
we will shoot you. If

1121
01:50:10,137 --> 01:50:11,805
Get that translator back, now.

1122
01:50:15,768 --> 01:50:19,730
Give him room. Give him room.

1123
01:50:27,154 --> 01:50:28,697
Hey, what do you got?

1124
01:50:28,697 --> 01:50:30,240
He came walking up to our checkpoint,

1125
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,533
said he had a bomb strapped to him.

1126
01:50:31,533 --> 01:50:33,077
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1127
01:50:33,077 --> 01:50:35,120
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.

1128
01:50:35,454 --> 01:50:36,997
Help this man.
He's not a bad man.

1129
01:50:36,997 --> 01:50:39,667
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him.

1130
01:50:40,584 --> 01:50:42,503
This is a joke. He's trying
to pull us closer.

1131
01:50:42,503 --> 01:50:43,796
Yeah. I got it. I got it.

1132
01:50:44,129 --> 01:50:48,258
All right. Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1133
01:50:48,801 --> 01:50:50,844
and see what's inside.

1134
01:50:54,264 --> 01:50:56,392
Slowly. Slowly.

1135
01:51:07,194 --> 01:51:08,570
Jesus.

1136
01:51:09,905 --> 01:51:12,199
All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1137
01:51:12,199 --> 01:51:14,493
- Get these guys back.
- You heard what he said. Get back.

1138
01:51:16,245 --> 01:51:18,914
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?

1139
01:51:19,957 --> 01:51:20,916
Slowly.

1140
01:51:21,917 --> 01:51:22,751
Get down.

1141
01:51:27,214 --> 01:51:28,924
Okay, I need your radio.

1142
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:31,260
- Can't we just shoot him?
- No.

1143
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,304
He's a....a family man.
He's not a bad man.

1144
01:51:33,304 --> 01:51:35,139
He's asking for help, only help.

1145
01:51:35,139 --> 01:51:39,685
Yeah, all right. You don't want
to die, get back! I got it.

1146
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,816
Listen, I know
we've had our differences.

1147
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:50,112
It happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.

1148
01:51:51,697 --> 01:51:53,574
This is suicide, man.

1149
01:51:55,117 --> 01:51:56,869
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?

1150
01:52:00,998 --> 01:52:02,082
Let's do this. Come on.

1151
01:52:02,082 --> 01:52:04,209
He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.

1152
01:52:05,377 --> 01:52:07,087
- We're good. Ready?
- Yep.

1153
01:52:12,843 --> 01:52:13,677
Go get them.

1154
01:52:13,886 --> 01:52:16,722
- Keep your eyes out on these.
- Yeah.

1155
01:52:27,483 --> 01:52:29,443
Get your hands up.

1156
01:52:32,613 --> 01:52:33,822
He says he has a family.

1157
01:52:35,491 --> 01:52:36,575
Please help him.

1158
01:52:42,706 --> 01:52:44,625
Now, listen.

1159
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:47,753
Look. It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this

1160
01:52:47,753 --> 01:52:49,630
if I just shoot you. Do you understand?

1161
01:52:54,301 --> 01:52:55,511
What's he saying?

1162
01:52:55,511 --> 01:52:59,431
He says I don't wish to die. I have a
family... Please take this off me.

1163
01:53:00,349 --> 01:53:04,728
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1164
01:53:10,818 --> 01:53:12,236
Look, that's not what I said.

1165
01:53:12,236 --> 01:53:15,739
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.

1166
01:53:18,617 --> 01:53:19,451
Listen.

1167
01:53:22,037 --> 01:53:22,955
Listen, listen.

1168
01:53:24,456 --> 01:53:28,127
You understand?

1169
01:53:30,504 --> 01:53:31,338
Okay.

1170
01:53:34,967 --> 01:53:35,926
What do you got here?

1171
01:53:37,678 --> 01:53:39,054
He has four children.

1172
01:53:44,435 --> 01:53:45,519
Shit.

1173
01:53:50,316 --> 01:53:53,736
Sanborn, we got a timer.
and we got a lot of wires, man.

1174
01:53:53,736 --> 01:53:55,863
I'm going to need
a little help on this.

1175
01:53:55,863 --> 01:53:57,406
Roger that. Tell me what you need.

1176
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:59,158
Bolt cutters.

1177
01:53:59,158 --> 01:54:01,785
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1178
01:54:01,785 --> 01:54:03,329
Roger that.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1179
01:54:07,416 --> 01:54:09,460
He says, please, I have a family.

1180
01:54:12,296 --> 01:54:13,130
Sst.

1181
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:17,217
I know. It's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

1182
01:54:21,722 --> 01:54:22,890
Please, don't leave me.

1183
01:54:28,438 --> 01:54:29,814
You weren't fucking kidding.

1184
01:54:30,273 --> 01:54:32,734
Nope. What's this made out of?

1185
01:54:38,615 --> 01:54:39,532
Oh, man.

1186
01:54:39,532 --> 01:54:41,409
That's case iron steel.

1187
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,329
Shit.

1188
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:45,121
What's our time?

1189
01:54:45,121 --> 01:54:46,706
- We got two minutes.
- Shit.

1190
01:54:47,082 --> 01:54:49,501
We're going to need a torch
to get this off.

1191
01:54:49,501 --> 01:54:51,544
Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.

1192
01:54:51,544 --> 01:54:52,253
He's dead, man.

1193
01:54:52,253 --> 01:54:53,588
Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just let me think.

1194
01:54:53,922 --> 01:54:56,299
We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this.

1195
01:54:57,092 --> 01:54:58,635
Shh, okay.

1196
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:00,971
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1197
01:55:05,558 --> 01:55:07,978
It's just we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.

1198
01:55:08,269 --> 01:55:10,563
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.

1199
01:55:11,356 --> 01:55:14,567
No. We got a minute and a half, man.
We gotta get out of here.

1200
01:55:14,567 --> 01:55:17,404
- I'll handle this. Just go.
- Come on, man.

1201
01:55:17,404 --> 01:55:19,281
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1202
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:21,032
Fuck him! Come on. Let's go.

1203
01:55:21,032 --> 01:55:23,868
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go.
- James!

1204
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:27,747
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds.
You have 45 seconds. Sanborn, leave.

1205
01:55:28,123 --> 01:55:29,749
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1206
01:55:29,749 --> 01:55:30,499
Go!

1207
01:55:31,918 --> 01:55:34,379
- Everybody get back!
- Go, go!

1208
01:55:39,968 --> 01:55:41,136
We got one.

1209
01:55:42,095 --> 01:55:44,347
Go, get back.

1210
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:51,980
I can't. There's too many locks.
There's too many. I can't do it.

1211
01:55:52,522 --> 01:55:54,316
I can't get it off. I'm sorry. Okay.

1212
01:55:54,608 --> 01:55:55,984
You understand? I'm sorry.

1213
01:55:56,985 --> 01:55:59,696
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry.

1214
01:55:59,696 --> 01:56:01,906
- Get down now!
- I can help him.

1215
01:56:04,784 --> 01:56:07,954
Get out of here. Go.

1216
01:56:31,144 --> 01:56:31,937
James!

1217
01:56:32,312 --> 01:56:34,356
Everybody up and out.
James!

1218
01:57:21,069 --> 01:57:21,987
You all right?

1219
01:57:25,615 --> 01:57:26,533
Aw, man,

1220
01:57:29,619 --> 01:57:31,246
I fucking hate this place.

1221
01:57:34,207 --> 01:57:35,417
Here, man. Have a hit.

1222
01:57:49,931 --> 01:57:51,891
I'm not ready to die, James.

1223
01:57:54,352 --> 01:57:55,979
Well, you're not going
to die out here, bro.

1224
01:57:57,647 --> 01:57:59,190
Another two inches.

1225
01:58:02,235 --> 01:58:04,904
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1226
01:58:06,573 --> 01:58:08,992
I bleed out like a pig in the sand.

1227
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,413
Nobody'll give a shit.

1228
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:19,586
I mean, my parents'll care,
but they don't count, man. Who else?

1229
01:58:27,427 --> 01:58:28,970
I don't even have a son.

1230
01:58:35,894 --> 01:58:38,188
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.

1231
01:58:38,897 --> 01:58:40,774
- Naw, man.
- You know?

1232
01:58:42,776 --> 01:58:43,860
I'm done.

1233
01:58:49,407 --> 01:58:50,659
I want a son.

1234
01:58:54,829 --> 01:58:56,623
I want a little boy, Will.

1235
01:59:03,588 --> 01:59:05,799
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?

1236
01:59:07,634 --> 01:59:09,010
Take the risk?

1237
01:59:16,851 --> 01:59:18,979
I don't know, I just...

1238
01:59:21,773 --> 01:59:22,899
I guess I don't think about it.

1239
01:59:36,705 --> 01:59:38,999
But you realize every time you suit up,

1240
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:41,835
every time we go out

1241
01:59:43,003 --> 01:59:45,422
it's life or death.
You roll the dice

1242
01:59:47,799 --> 01:59:48,925
and you deal with it.

1243
01:59:51,511 --> 01:59:53,054
You recognize that, don't you?

1244
01:59:58,893 --> 01:59:59,936
Yeah.

1245
02:00:10,196 --> 02:00:11,406
Yeah, I do.

1246
02:00:13,325 --> 02:00:14,784
But I don't know why.

1247
02:00:16,953 --> 02:00:18,038
Yeah.

1248
02:00:27,756 --> 02:00:32,052
I don't know, JT.
You know why I am the way?

1249
02:00:37,849 --> 02:00:38,892
Naw, I don't.

1250
02:01:41,371 --> 02:01:44,958
- Wow. You did some shopping.
- Yeah.

1251
02:01:45,709 --> 02:01:47,419
I got some soda.
We done?

1252
02:01:49,129 --> 02:01:51,339
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1253
02:01:52,674 --> 02:01:54,467
Okay. Cereal.

1254
02:01:58,930 --> 02:01:59,848
Where?

1255
02:02:59,533 --> 02:03:02,954
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,

1256
02:03:03,829 --> 02:03:05,790
starts passing out free candies.

1257
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:08,334
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff.

1258
02:03:10,586 --> 02:03:11,671
He detonates.

1259
02:03:14,507 --> 02:03:15,883
They're saying 59 are dead.

1260
02:03:26,435 --> 02:03:28,145
You know they need more bomb techs.

1261
02:03:32,316 --> 02:03:33,567
You want to chop those up for me?

1262
02:03:35,486 --> 02:03:37,196
Boing, boing, boing.

1263
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:45,871
Yeah.

1264
02:03:48,165 --> 02:03:49,875
You love playing with that.

1265
02:03:50,876 --> 02:03:53,087
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals.

1266
02:03:54,213 --> 02:03:59,802
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.

1267
02:04:00,011 --> 02:04:02,763
You love everything, don't you?
Yeah.

1268
02:04:04,432 --> 02:04:05,683
You know what, buddy?

1269
02:04:06,809 --> 02:04:08,060
Once you get older,

1270
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:14,358
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.

1271
02:04:15,192 --> 02:04:16,902
Like your Jack in the Box.

1272
02:04:20,031 --> 02:04:24,827
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1273
02:04:27,079 --> 02:04:31,208
and then you forget
the few things you really love.

1274
02:04:34,545 --> 02:04:38,049
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things.

1275
02:04:46,682 --> 02:04:48,559
With me I think it's one.

1276
02:05:25,304 --> 02:05:27,598
- Welcome to Delta Company.
- Sergeant.

1277
02:06:12,723 --> 02:06:43,766
The Hurt Locker
