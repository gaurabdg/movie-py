1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,124
On the count of three.

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,003
One, two, three!

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,632
Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter.
Look how easy it is.

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,093
There you go, a winner!

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:57,014
And now, for my shocking finale.

6
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,558
Not for the squeamish.

7
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,020
Not for the faint of heart.

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,067
I call my trick "The Jaws of Death."

9
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,488
Now. Say it. Say it.

10
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,283
Harold, use your awesome might
to save me from this hopeless plight.

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,952
No harm will come to you.
Alakazam!

12
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,212
Help me! Help me!

13
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,726
I'm going to be an actress.

14
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,590
Hard to believe it was last Christmas...

15
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,675
...that me and Harmony
changed the world.

16
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,638
And we didn't mean to.
And it didn't last long, you know.

17
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,139
A thing like that can't.

18
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,143
Now that I'm in L.A., I go to parties.
The kind where if a girl is named Jill...

19
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,771
...she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.

20
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,692
That's me there. My name's
Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.

21
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,236
Welcome to L.A.

22
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,737
Welcome to the party.

23
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,004
The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw,
my producer. He discovered me.

24
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,342
The man with him is Perry Van Shrike,
a.k.a. Gay Perry.

25
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,096
Honest-to-God private eye,
consults in film, TV. Just incorporated.

26
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,682
He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.

27
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,183
Don't start, Perry, huh?

28
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,353
I seen you play ball. You're tough.
But you see a naked guy...

29
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,188
...your brain says, "I want that."

30
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,733
I don't make that leap. It's like,
"Look, there's an elephant. Quick...

31
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,736
...let's drain its blood
to paint my boathouse."

32
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,864
It's just that that's not the first thing
you think of.

33
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,700
L.A.

34
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,828
By now you may wonder
how I wound up here, or maybe not.

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,081
Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty
picks shit up from comic books.

36
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,293
Point is, l don't see another
goddamn narrator, so pipe down.

37
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,296
How did I get here? See for yourself.

38
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,930
Chloe, just run the name by me
one more time...

39
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,016
...because I must be
missing something.

40
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,893
I'm going nuts.
I've been through the store three times.

41
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,813
Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E--
Why don't you ask...

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,649
-...an employee or something?
-No, they're all busy.

43
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:23,113
"Protocop, protector of man."
Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.

44
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,450
Uncle Harry, look around.
There are signs.

45
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:31,455
That show was cancelled two years ago.
Just ask-- Wait, are they even open?

46
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,499
Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look--
Get away from the window.

47
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,085
--I gotta go, but I'll find this.

48
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,549
-Great.
-Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong!

49
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,718
-Give me the gun!
-No. Give me the bullets!

50
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,845
Freeze!

51
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,183
-You gotta be fucking kidding me.
-We'll stand here and wait for the police.

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,895
Drop the gun. We didn't do anything.
We are not dangerous. Drop the gun.

53
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,981
-Hey, lady, gun is not loaded--
-Ritchie, no!

54
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,108
Richie!

55
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,027
Shit!

56
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,992
Oh, boy.

57
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,588
Take it easy.

58
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,926
Jesus. Oh, no, no.
We're not ready for you yet, sir.

59
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,221
-Go wait with the others.
-Grace, do me a favor, let's take him.

60
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,972
-He's ready. You're ready?
-Ready?

61
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,516
Okay, come on.

62
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,394
You know the setup?
Got any questions?

63
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,938
He's got no questions.
Look at him. Let's go.

64
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,439
Let's read.

65
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,445
-Where is he? Where's Raphael?
-Where is he?

66
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,947
Where's--?

67
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,081
Beat up on me all night. You want me
to give up my partner, you can go spit.

68
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,878
Quit acting like the good guy,
jerk-off.

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,672
You got your partner killed.

70
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,925
He was in over his head,
you knew it.

71
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,261
You may as well
have pulled the trigger.

72
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,971
You killed him!

73
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,853
No, I didn't-- I didn't kill him.
He wanted in.

74
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,647
Why--?

75
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,150
Why?!

76
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,610
I didn't want him to come in on it.
He insisted.

77
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,699
I said, "Stay at home." But he doesn't
listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch.

78
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,742
I killed him, didn't I?

79
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,872
Oh, fuck, this is my fault. I'm sorry.

80
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,921
Sorry.

81
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,383
Hey, good luck.

82
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,512
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Old school. Method.

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,015
-Studio.
-Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A.

84
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,516
Get Gay Perry on the phone.

85
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,270
Now, get this, they're screen-testing me.
Is that wild?

86
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,440
One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes
in the East Village...

87
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,901
...the next,
I'm sipping champagne in L.A.

88
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,903
-Hi.
-Hey.

89
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,488
So, what do you do?

90
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm retired.
I invented dice when I was a kid.

91
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,786
-How about you?
-I do a little acting.

92
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,250
I'm gonna see who else is here.

93
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,628
Anyway, that's how I got to the party.

94
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,757
Now, Harmony, different story.

95
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,093
Some will tell you she got here
on account of the giant robot.

96
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,762
I'll show you that in a minute.

97
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,057
But for me, robot-schmobot,
she was destined to be here.

98
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,017
Jeez, look at those stems, will you?

99
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,270
Not that that's what constitutes
why she should be here.

100
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,231
Yes, racist. I'm serious.

101
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,943
The other reindeer laughed at him.
Then, out of the blue, they need him.

102
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,070
He's as good as a fog light
or whatever.

103
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,490
You know what, so you tell me,
how is it any different than:

104
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,867
"Don't talk to Reggie, he's black.

105
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,579
Oh, wait, he can play basketball.
Sign him up."

106
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,123
Rudolph, Reggie.

107
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,836
Harmony Faith Lane was your typical
L.A. girl, she wasn't from there.

108
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,130
She grew up in a burg
in southern Indiana.

109
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,634
"When in doubt, cut up a pig."
That was the town motto.

110
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,846
Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls,
Harmony was wicked smart.

111
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,890
Of course, credit where credit's due...

112
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,643
...she had a terrific mentor.
No, not her.

113
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,852
Him.

114
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,106
"'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!'

115
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,109
She poured herself
into a seamless dress.

116
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,820
From the looks of it,
she spilled some."

117
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,364
Jonny spoke from the pages
of cheap paperbacks...

118
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,701
...and told of a promised land
known as "the Coast"...

119
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,997
...and a magical city
called Los Angeles.

120
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,750
As the years progressed,
she wished he was real.

121
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,547
Wished that he would come to Indiana
to save her little sister, Jenna.

122
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,385
You see, Papa was at her
night after night.

123
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,345
But Jonny never showed.

124
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,682
And then the guy
writing the books died.

125
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,559
Age 1 6, she split.

126
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,645
Took the bus to L.A.,
the promised land.

127
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,523
She'd get rich and famous
and then help little sis.

128
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,025
Before he died...

129
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,736
...the guy who wrote the books
said Jonny was a joke.

130
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,904
He wrote it for money,
and it was bullshit.

131
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,408
Harmony ignored this. She knew better.
I mean, who the hell was he?

132
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,410
He was just a writer.

133
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,121
And that's how she got
to the same party as me--

134
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,914
Oh, shit. I skipped something.

135
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,917
Damn it. This robot bit.
I made a big deal, then I forgot.

136
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,670
Fuck, bad narrating.
Like my dad telling a joke.

137
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,758
"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you
the cowboy rode a blue horse." Fuck.

138
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,595
I don't know if you want to see it now,
but here's the fucking robot stuff.

139
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,096
Can I say "fuck" more?

140
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,807
Now back to Protocop,
starring Jeff Neal.

141
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,168
What the--?

142
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,006
Oh, my God.

143
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,635
Hey!

144
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,228
Sources close to Neal, who has not
worked as an actor in two years...

145
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,563
...say he seemed despondent
earlier tonight...

146
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,732
...during a rerun of Protocop.

147
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,860
The actor, who still retains a costume
he wore on the show...

148
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,487
...allegedly dressed up...

149
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,616
...stumbled down the bike path and
wandered into this Venice Beach house...

150
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:46,413
...where aspiring actress Harmony Faith
Lane was shocked to discover him.

151
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,874
I'd jog by, "Hi, hello," you know,
that sort of thing.

152
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,584
-Who's this?
-I feel for the guy.

153
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,129
This city can't get enough
of messing with people.

154
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,590
Like putting a whoopee cushion
on the seat of an electric chair.

155
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,676
-Like that.
-They always do this.

156
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,722
You can never see below the waist.
It's like a Playmate in 1 964.

157
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,100
It was always behind the bedpost
or there's a shadow. You never--

158
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,978
What am I telling you for?
Invite her to something.

159
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,939
And there it was. Bingo.

160
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,151
Destiny.

161
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,300
You know what,
you better be her doctor.

162
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,803
Walk away. Don't think, just do it.

163
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,807
What, are you her brother or something?
It's none of your business, man.

164
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,228
-I will fuck you up.
-No, you'll try.

165
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,189
And that little experiment
will end in tears, my friend.

166
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,443
So again, for the cheap seats,
do not think, walk the fuck away.

167
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,737
Or let's you and me
go outside right now.

168
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,323
It's past my bedtime.

169
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,534
Make a choice.

170
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,343
Asshole.

171
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,015
You all right?

172
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,601
Yeah.

173
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,436
Thanks, bro.

174
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,939
One day,
I'll actually learn how to fight.

175
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,441
-Perry Van Shrike.
-Hey. Harry Lockhart.

176
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,697
I heard about you. You're
the whatchamacallit, the consultant.

177
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,200
-You must be-- Anyway....
-Gay Perry?

178
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,412
Yeah. Right.
Dabney calls you that.

179
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,956
-I guess you guys are old buddies.
-Five years.

180
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,292
Wow, five years.

181
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,918
-Still gay?
-Me? No.

182
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:43,882
I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the
name so much, I can't get rid of it.

183
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,012
You should know better than to fall
asleep at a party. There's freaks here.

184
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,474
Dabney wants you
to take detective lessons.

185
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,269
-Come again?
-For your acting.

186
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,354
I've got surveillance tomorrow.
You game?

187
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,273
What's the person like? Crime lord?

188
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,526
Please. I'm guessing some sad,
lonely little man...

189
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,863
...who single-handedly haunts his own
home in the Hollywood Hills.

190
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,365
That was incredibly gay.

191
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,785
-Good God. Ouch.
-Yeah, you should see the other guy.

192
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,205
Harry, this is our generous host,
Harlan Dexter.

193
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,877
Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's
golden boy from back East.

194
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,795
I hope it isn't past your bedtime.

195
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,381
No, sir. My mom used to say
I had the neon disease.

196
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,550
When the neon lights came on,
I woke up.

197
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,888
I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted.
My daughter just lived 1 0 years in Paris.

198
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,642
She says it is heaven
for the vampire set.

199
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,898
If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm
meant to help cut this monstrosity.

200
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,486
Mom's gone, so it's just him
and his born-again little bundle of joy.

201
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,696
-Born-again? That's precious.
-Isn't it?

202
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,574
Three months ago, she was suing him
over Mom's millions.

203
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,785
He called her a-- Well, a bad word.

204
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,831
Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.

205
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,709
Okay, I apologize.

206
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,380
That is a terrible scene.
It's like, "Why was that in the movie?

207
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,966
Gee, you think maybe
it'll come back later, maybe?"

208
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,094
l hate that. A TV's on,
talking about the new power plant.

209
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,012
Wonder where the climax will happen.

210
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,100
Or that shot of the cook in
Hunt for Red October. Sorry.

211
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,727
Hi, thank you for coming.

212
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,814
Hey, do you know that blond gal
who just left?

213
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,567
Oh, the one with the guy
that beat the shit out of you? No.

214
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,528
Bye, have a better night.

215
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,947
She had something, that gal,
this quality.

216
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,740
Like the girl from high school...

217
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,244
...the one that got away. You know
what I mean? That haunts you still.

218
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,371
-Yeah, I had that.
-You did?

219
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,790
Bobby Mills.

220
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,877
Well, maybe you should
try to get in touch.

221
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,338
I got 5 bucks says
you could still get him.

222
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,800
Really? That's funny.
I got a 1 0 says, "Pass the pepper."

223
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,720
I got two quarters harmonizing on
"Moonlight in Vermont."

224
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,930
-What?
-Talking money.

225
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,266
-A talking monkey?
-Talking monkey, yeah.

226
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,769
Came here from the future.
Ugly sucker. Only says, "Ficus."

227
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,939
Detective lessons tomorrow.

228
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,482
-Don't forget.
-Okay.

229
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,984
And Harry....

230
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,902
Come here.

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,488
That girl, I know her.
She's done some work for me.

232
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,324
Try the Domino Room.

233
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,160
Where's that?

234
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,221
-Hey there. I'm Flicka.
-Hey.

235
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,308
-How are you?
-Good. So, what do you do?

236
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,354
-I'm a private detective. And you?
-I'm a stewardess.

237
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,315
-Really?
-Yeah.

238
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,650
-Well, nice to meet you.
-That it?

239
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,944
-Yeah.
-Yep.

240
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,913
Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks.

241
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,957
Evening. Harry.

242
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,377
God, I'm sore.

243
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,799
I mean, physically, not like a guy
who's angry in a movie in the 1 950s.

244
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,264
-Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?
-Why?

245
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,058
-Why what?
-Why me?

246
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:27,063
Seriously, why not the girl over there?
Look, she's very pretty.

247
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,564
Which one?

248
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,109
On the left,
next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.

249
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,361
Oh, that's a bit of a reach.

250
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,072
I'm interrupting. I feel badly.
What are you drinking?

251
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,866
-Bad.
-Bad? Sorry?

252
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,701
-You feel bad.
-Bad?

253
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,247
"Badly" is an adverb. To say you
feel badly says that the mechanism...

254
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:49,127
-...which allows you to feel is broken.
-Well, that one over there?

255
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,129
Between-- Oh, God, nix, nix. That's--

256
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,715
-The blond. The blond's pathetic.
-Because?

257
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,595
For starters, she's been fucked
more times than she's had hot meals.

258
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,557
I heard. It was neck and neck,
and then she skipped lunch.

259
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,392
-Worst thing, though....
-Do tell.

260
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,520
Worst thing is she's 35 years old
and still trying to act.

261
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,523
I see her at auditions all the time.

262
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,860
-It's over, baby. You missed.
-That's charitable of you.

263
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,570
May I ask how old you are?

264
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,281
-Go for it.
-Okay, how old are you?

265
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,824
-Thirty-four.
-Yeah?

266
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,661
-I'm a baby.
-Where's your buddy? The guy you--

267
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,165
-The guy you left the party with?
-He's a fucking asshole.

268
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,375
I just needed a ride.
Sorry, I swear a lot.

269
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,544
-I know. It's okay.
-Did you know the host?

270
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,046
-No.
-He looked familiar, though.

271
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,174
Probably an actor.

272
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,427
Go away, Mr. Fly.

273
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,973
-I was talking to your friend.
-She doesn't want to talk to you.

274
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,642
Sunshine, she'll be back to you
in a minute. Relax.

275
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,686
She doesn't have a minute.

276
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,650
Tell you what, if you change your mind
about that drink...

277
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,112
...I'll be over there
with Native American Joe Pesci.

278
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,784
-You are so....
-That was good, right?

279
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,786
Why are you humoring him? Stop it.

280
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,789
You know what,
there's an empty table over there.

281
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,959
I hear it's a recommended
cheeseball hangout.

282
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,503
Your mouth is a recommended place
to put a sock.

283
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,256
Princess. Scary friend.

284
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,675
Goddamn it.

285
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,971
Harry Lockhart, are you gonna
recognize me or what?

286
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,390
God! Embrey, Indiana!

287
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,145
Loves snakes, afraid of spiders.

288
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,858
Come on, remember?
You were Amazing Harry--

289
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,527
-No, no, no. Harold the Great.
-Harmony?

290
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,071
You cut me in half, remember?

291
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?

292
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,535
Okay, I was a bad narrator again...

293
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,830
...because the kid at the beginning,
the magician, that was me.

294
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,749
I don't want to put this on you...

295
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,877
...but if you've been paying attention,
I shouldn't have to--

296
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,421
Great. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle.
I got an idea.

297
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,259
Why not put these two lame-o extras
in front of the mammoth fucking lens?

298
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,511
Boo. Scat. Fat lady, leave.

299
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,972
See there? "Harold."

300
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,766
Remember how I said
this high school chick haunted me?

301
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,977
How seeing Harmony made me
think of her?

302
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,646
That's because it was her.
It all came flooding back.

303
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,233
How I was the one she confided in.

304
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,278
While she was doing every other guy.

305
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,323
It was the first time I felt
that how pitying someone...

306
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,618
...and wanting to fuck them
can get all tangled up in your head.

307
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,204
Overwhelming sadness.
Meanwhile, you got a rodney.

308
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:34,292
Is that sick? I think--
Yeah, l think that's sick.

309
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:40,172
Leaving my sister back home,
leaving her there all alone....

310
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,844
Hardest thing I ever did.

311
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,559
Do you remember
when we were real little...

312
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,854
...and a movie crew came to town?

313
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,982
That mystery flick with the guy,
Jonny what's-his-name?

314
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,026
-Gossamer.
-Jonny Gossamer. Right.

315
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,362
Your mom went nuts,
and she bought all the books and stuff.

316
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,908
-That was-- God, that was forever ago.
-Yeah, that was back in the day.

317
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,703
Harry...

318
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,998
...I didn't get famous.

319
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,793
Yet.

320
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,798
I did...

321
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,884
...get to do this one commercial.

322
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,428
You're shitting me. Which one?

323
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,097
Well, you know the one with the bear?

324
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,642
And it goes-- Well, this is funny.

325
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,729
-"I prefer Genaros, but--"
-"But I'm a bear, what do I know?

326
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,731
I suck heads off fish." That was you?

327
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,734
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it was. Yeah.

328
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,611
-That's awesome.
-Commercial.

329
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,279
Come on, that's a big deal.

330
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,531
-That's a national commercial.
-Harry, stop.

331
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,410
It's nothing. There was actually this
kind of cool moment where I got...

332
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,579
...to sort of do the wave.

333
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,000
"I prefer Genaros."

334
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,461
-Whatever, it's nothing.
-It's pretty cool.

335
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,464
-It's nothing special at all.
-Well, I think it's special.

336
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,009
Punk-rock Steven Seagal
thinks it's special.

337
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,762
Right there, at your 1 1 o'clock.

338
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,430
That's dead-on, right?

339
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,392
That's all right.
I had him pegged when I came in.

340
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,271
Come back to the hotel for a little while,
just have one drink. Bring your friend.

341
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:23,401
It'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster
than you can say "Jack Robinson."

342
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,778
I don't know about that. I can say...

343
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,741
-..."Jack Robinson" pretty fast.
-I'm timing you.

344
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,286
Jack Robinson.

345
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,651
-Do you have any idea what time it is?
-I'm really sorry.

346
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,529
God, you still look great.
You're just stunning. I like--

347
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,489
-Why are you here?
-Good question.

348
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,075
Sounds crazy, but I don't remember
what occurred...

349
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,244
...between the hours of 2 and 5,
a blur.

350
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,496
-Really? Where's Marleah?
-Marleah?

351
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,374
-The girl you....
-Marleah fell asleep at my place...

352
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,042
...and I didn't see you leave--

353
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,587
I left when you had your tongue
down her throat.

354
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,088
-I did?
-Yeah.

355
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,632
God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman.
That's bad.

356
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,051
Yeah, that's bad.
You got 1 0 seconds, Harry.

357
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,220
Oh, boy, pressure, pressure.
I came here...

358
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,890
...because I think
you're intelligent and attractive--

359
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,518
That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God!
I can't believe you'd come here...

360
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,396
...to tell me you like me
after you fucked my friend!

361
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,024
That's just it, I didn't.
I believe that I did not.

362
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,901
What? You said you don't remember!

363
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,488
If I don't remember because I was drunk,
how could I have gotten it up?

364
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,656
I know this is outrageous
and not normal.

365
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,702
I'm not pretending that I'm normal.
I just chickened out--

366
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,956
Moron. Why? Why? Why?

367
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,031
And the plots, they all have this thing,
this formula that was so cool.

368
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,492
Seriously, I would go through one
in a day.

369
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,204
-A whole book in one day. Wow.
-See, Gossamer would always take on...

370
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,540
...two cases
that were seemingly unrelated.

371
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,042
One's normal
and the other's some wild shit...

372
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,461
...then you'd find out
that they're connected.

373
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,630
That it's all one case.

374
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,257
That's the essence of the--

375
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,844
Yeah, I get that all the time. Would
you mind not rooting around in there?

376
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,138
It's tiny. Is this real?

377
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,475
Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded.

378
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,187
-I call it my faggot gun.
-Because?

379
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,441
It's only good for a couple shots, then
you gotta drop it for something better.

380
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,695
You asked, chief.

381
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,198
On with our lesson.

382
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,203
-My client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.
-Ames.

383
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,582
Female. She hired me
to do some video surveillance.

384
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,333
-Is she a looker?
-Oh, man.

385
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,795
She opens the door,
she got nothing on but the radio.

386
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,339
Invites me to sit down,
sits on my lap...

387
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,842
-...fires up a smoke.
-Really?

388
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,511
No. Idiot.

389
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,638
She hired me over the phone.

390
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,850
-Paid for it with a credit card.
-Okay.

391
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:48,564
Rule number one:
This business, real life, it's boring.

392
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,108
-Do you have to smoke?
-You want me to put it out?

393
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,446
Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown
clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.

394
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,408
So you knew Harmony in high school.
You said she dissed you.

395
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,994
No, not really.
She fucked every other guy but me.

396
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,371
No, that's not true.
She made one concession.

397
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,041
She agreed not to fuck my best friend,
Chook Chutney.

398
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,501
He was my best friend,
so she gave me that.

399
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,422
-Well, that was nice of her.
-Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.

400
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,467
Stay put. Be quiet.

401
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,638
"Chook Chutney"? Yeah, he's gay.

402
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,698
-What's wrong with his car?
-Do I look like a mechanic?

403
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,370
-Are we gonna follow him?
-Where'd he go?

404
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,040
He was right in front of us,
then he cut in-- Where is he?

405
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,297
What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere.
He turned right in front of us.

406
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,681
-Jesus!
-Shit!

407
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,349
Harry, come back.

408
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,892
Harry.

409
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,937
-There's no one in the car. Harry.
-What?

410
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,231
Harry, stop.

411
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,234
-I think it's going down.
-Wait, the sound.

412
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,528
-Check the back seat.
-No, get the keys!

413
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,905
The keys! Get the keys!

414
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,662
Perry.

415
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,499
Perry?

416
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,460
Shit.

417
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,841
Perry!

418
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,346
Where'd she come from?

419
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,975
She was in the trunk.
I had to shoot the lock to get it open.

420
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,476
Oh, Jesus.

421
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,063
God, what did they do to her face?

422
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,736
-Is she dead?
-No. She's resting her eyes for a minute.

423
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,196
Of course she's fucking dead.
Her neck's broken.

424
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,421
-Hey, what the hell's going on?
-Shut up.

425
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,883
-Hey, we got a dead girl here!
-Hey, shut up.

426
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,510
Two guys in masks,
and there they go.

427
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,554
What the fuck is going on?
This is bad.

428
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,598
We gotta roll before the cops come.

429
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,726
-Nix. We go right to the cops.
-Exactly, to the cops...

430
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,563
...who'll believe that she broke her neck
before you shot her in the head.

431
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,148
What?

432
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,609
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Oh, God.

433
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,236
-We gotta go. Go, go, go.
-Oh, God.

434
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,155
Oh, God.

435
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,241
-All right, we're out of here.
-We gotta go, go, go.

436
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,743
Where's my gun?

437
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,745
-No, I--
-Give me my gun.

438
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,413
-I got rid of it.
-Say again.

439
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,665
Threw it in the lake.
You wouldn't, I would.

440
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,502
I got priors in New York,
so I can't be messing around--

441
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,462
-You threw it away?
-It's evidence.

442
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,964
-Watch it. Relax.
-Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry.

443
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,176
-I got a little nonplussed there.
-This is crazy. I understand.

444
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,095
-What is that? Is that a clue?
-What do you mean?

445
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,764
-Do you see that?
-In the thing?

446
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,974
What were you thinking?

447
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,269
My $2000 ceramic Vektor
my mother got me as a special gift...

448
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,773
...you threw next to the car.
What happens when they drag the lake?

449
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,608
You think they'll find my pistol?

450
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,362
Jesus. Look up "idiot" in the dictionary.
You know what you'll find?

451
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,113
-A picture of me?
-No...

452
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,742
...the definition of the word "idiot,"
which you fucking are.

453
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,538
Bitch client.

454
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,873
Hires me, has me witness a murder.

455
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,334
-Can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet.
-No.

456
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,753
-This towel is wet.
-The towel is for the seat.

457
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,714
This was for your shoes.
You handed it to me for my face?

458
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,300
-This is wet. Can I use a dry--?
-It's dirty. No.

459
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,178
-Can I--?
-No. Stop dripping.

460
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,515
Shit better be improving your acting.

461
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,237
-Get out.
-Sorry about the gun.

462
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,155
Whatever. Out.

463
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,533
Go. Sleep badly.

464
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,411
Any questions, hesitate to call.

465
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,538
-Bad.
-Excuse me?

466
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,039
Sleep bad.

467
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,209
Otherwise, it seems like
the mechanism that allows sleep--

468
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,921
What, fuckhead? "Badly" is an adverb.
Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.

469
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,509
-I'll give you a buzz.
-Die.

470
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,438
That's all right, don't apologize.

471
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,941
-Blow me. You forgot this.
-Oh, thanks.

472
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,986
-Hello?
-l'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.

473
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,905
-Speaking.
-I'm detective Sgt. Kale.

474
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,198
Mind answering a question or two?

475
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,451
Of course, no problem.
Fire away, officer.

476
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,954
Are you familiar with a woman
by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?

477
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,456
Yeah, what's this--?

478
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,542
Are you aware of giving your number
to Miss Lane recently?

479
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,794
-On a slip of paper, perhaps?
-No.

480
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,964
-Are you sure?
-Well, maybe she had my number. Why?

481
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,968
We're required by law to treat every
suicide as a potential homicide.

482
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,262
Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.

483
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,932
-Suicide?
-Yes--

484
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,560
Hello?

485
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,398
-I'll be goddamned.
-Jesus.

486
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,447
Don't blame yourself. Listen...

487
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,867
-...sometimes these things just happen--
-For a reason.

488
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,203
For a reason? Fuck that.

489
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,041
Why? Because I fall off a building,
1 0 people in Baltimore...

490
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,043
...survive a bus crash?

491
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,547
Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore.
I'm lying here with my brains out.

492
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,051
I've been to Baltimore, you win.

493
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,721
Listen...

494
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,935
-...I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
-Yeah.

495
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,189
I gotta go.

496
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,859
I have to go.

497
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,377
Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.

498
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,547
I prefer Genaros.
But what do I know? I'm a bear.

499
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,591
I suck the heads off fish.

500
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,928
Genaros.

501
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,977
I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter
than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club.

502
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,605
I needed a hot bath, a warm bed.

503
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,068
But the night had other plans for me.

504
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,279
-Oh, you did?
-I got the Cyber Agent.

505
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,365
-You got the Cyber Agent.
-It has all the cool weapons.

506
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,992
You got Protocop coming too.

507
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,912
It's gonna be worth more too
because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.

508
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,999
Son of a bitch!

509
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,462
See, I forgot, old Jonny,
he always had two cases. Remember?

510
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,213
How are you?

511
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,215
Hey.

512
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,261
She's gone, Harry.

513
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,181
-Yeah.
-She's gone.

514
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,434
I know. Who?

515
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,937
Fact is, she stole not only
your credit card, but your ID.

516
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,648
We're very sorry about
the mix-up on our part.

517
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,110
So are you willing to positively identify
this woman as your--

518
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,237
-My sister! Yes!
-Your sister was here?

519
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh, God!
God, we haven't spoken in years.

520
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,201
She's never forgiven me
for leaving her all alone.

521
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,245
-I'm just gonna get you a blanket.
-I don't want a blanket!

522
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,122
-But you're shivering.
-I don't care!

523
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,458
You're freaking me out.
Will you relax, okay?

524
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,627
-Oh, God.
-I'm so glad that you're okay...

525
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,963
...but now, I don't know, you're
making me more nervous. Sit down.

526
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,548
-Okay.
-Tell me what happened.

527
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,219
Yesterday, Jenna,
she got into my house, Harry.

528
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,346
She must have been broke,
I don't know.

529
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,974
She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card,
California ID, God knows what else.

530
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,060
-Right.
-Oh, God.

531
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,812
-No more lies, Harry.
-No.

532
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,563
No.

533
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,607
Are you a detective?

534
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,320
-Are you a detective?
-Who told you that?

535
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,198
Flicka. Flicka.
You know, my friend? She told me.

536
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,950
She told me you were a detective.

537
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,536
-If you are, then I really need your help.
-Well--

538
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,371
That's empty, honey.

539
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,334
Okay, I know this sounds crazy,
Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.

540
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,213
-My sister's been living out here....
-Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell?

541
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,800
What was she even doing here?
The lady in the lake, now the sister.

542
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,345
This was two corpses in three hours.
Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?

543
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,140
Yeah, looking back,
I maybe should've told her...

544
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,267
...I wasn't really a nipple-- Detective.

545
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,020
Detective. Sorry. I should've said
something, but she wouldn't shut up.

546
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,398
The card she stole from me
was maxed out.

547
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:56,153
Right before she died, she charged over
$2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it?

548
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,240
Sentron something.
Some bullshit company! Plus--

549
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,785
Red flag, Harry. She took her
birth control pill for the day.

550
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,121
Why would she even bother
with the pill, huh?

551
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,332
She was murdered, Harry.
She was murdered. She was murdered.

552
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,127
Honey, all right.
Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.

553
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,962
Are you gonna help me, Harry?

554
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,007
-I gotta check my schedule--
-If you're not gonna help me...

555
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,051
...I need to get out of here,
find someone that'll help me.

556
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,596
-I just gotta check my schedule.
-Can you help me?

557
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,432
If you're not gonna help me,
I need to find somebody else!

558
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,518
-My caseload is pretty--
-Oh, Harry, thank you.

559
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,008
Yuck, come on.

560
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,856
-It was nothing. I didn't do anything.
-What are you doing?

561
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,442
-I didn't do anything.
-You were grabbing my tit.

562
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,153
No, there was a spider.
There was a big spider.

563
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,906
-Oh, please, whatever.
-I swear to God.

564
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,994
Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing.
Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.

565
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,623
-Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.
-Clearly, you don't.

566
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,210
Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit.
It's life, all right? It's no biggie.

567
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:41,007
No biggie? Guy grabs your tit,
"That's life, no biggie"?

568
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,261
I mean, what kind of talk is that?

569
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,806
No, you tell me. What kind of talk
is that? I can't believe you.

570
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,976
I can't believe that
that's the reaction that--

571
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,232
See there?

572
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,067
Yeah.

573
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,904
-I trust you.
-Right.

574
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,783
What is your problem? I'm letting you
off the hook. You didn't do anything.

575
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,535
No, but you thought I did.

576
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,122
Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook
is my home. Do you understand?

577
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,751
Listen to me. I grab your tit,
it's a fucking biggie!

578
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,212
That came out wrong.
But what I'm saying is...

579
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,425
...you act like, "Oops, it's an okay lapse.
You know, everybody does it."

580
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,553
What the fuck kind of guys
you hang out with here?

581
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,431
I mean, are you the kind of girl
who like, you know...?

582
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,599
Who what, Harry?

583
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,519
Who what?

584
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,565
Forget it.

585
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,526
I'm sorry, just relax.
Just get some rest, okay?

586
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,905
Okay, we'll start on your case
tomorrow. All right?

587
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,949
-Afternoon good?
-Whatever, Harry.

588
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,451
-I'm going.
-Okay.

589
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,996
-I'm taking some sweats, all right?
-Yeah, anything you want to borrow.

590
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,207
-I'll give them back.
-Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer.

591
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,335
If it's in the drawer, it's clean.

592
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,046
Night, Harry.

593
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,383
Harry?

594
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,511
This is....

595
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,723
-This is really great.
-Isn't it?

596
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,226
-I'm leaving.
-Yeah, some nice rest.

597
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,728
Bye.

598
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,397
Fuck off--!

599
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,484
Say again? They gave her back?

600
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,612
Yes. She's in my shower.
I'm looking at her, for chrissake.

601
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,906
That's impossible.
They don't even know you.

602
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:32,869
You're right. The body can't be here.
This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf.

603
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,163
-Shut up. How did they get in?
-I don't know.

604
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,499
How am I supposed to know?
Fire escape, maybe.

605
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,461
Okay, first things first. We gotta move
her somewhere. You got gloves?

606
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,505
-Excuse me?
-Gloves. Do you have gloves?

607
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,759
You have to move her. If it's a frame-up,
some asshole's calling the cops on you.

608
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,762
Do this: Wrap up the body
in a blanket, a sheet, anything.

609
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,182
-Okay, any particular kind of gloves?
-Yes, fawn.

610
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,850
Will you fucking hurry?

611
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,352
-Perry?
-Yeah?

612
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,604
-I peed on it.
-What? You peed on what?

613
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,524
I peed on the corpse.
Can they do, like, an ID from that?

614
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,568
-I'm sorry, you peed on--?
-On the corpse. My question is--

615
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,445
No, my question. I get to go first.

616
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,989
Why in poo-perfect hell
would you pee on a corpse?

617
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,991
It's not like I did it for kicks.

618
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,911
You said this doesn't happen.
This is your fault!

619
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,331
Shut up and listen.
First, we have to wrap the body.

620
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,291
Second, you've got to find the gun.

621
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,336
-Say this with me, "Find the gun."
-Find the gun.

622
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,213
Damn it, I threw it in the lake.

623
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,591
Not my gun, idiot. They dropped
the body on you, it's a frame-up.

624
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,469
Then they also have planted a gun,
trust me. Move it.

625
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,972
I'll be there in four minutes.

626
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:58,538
Caller specified room 714, some sort of
brawl or something. Violent.

627
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,833
Yeah, 714. Lockhart.

628
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,587
-Let me get you the key.
-Actually, it's not 714, it's 514.

629
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,173
I was just up there,
and it's really noisy.

630
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,384
-Let's get the key.
-Yep, pretty awful.

631
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,231
-Don't answer that.
-Yeah, duh.

632
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,609
-That it?
-No, that's the corpse...

633
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,694
...from the last guy who stayed here.

634
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,196
Fuck off. Was there a gun?

635
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,365
Yeah, it's right here. Perry,
sons of bitches made us, made me.

636
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,702
I'm in town for two days, they know
who I am and where to find me.

637
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,706
-That's impossible.
-Yeah, it's totally nuts. Back stairway.

638
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,878
I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive.
She thinks her sister was murdered.

639
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,880
-Come again?
-Never mind.

640
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,649
See, these dudes tonight,
they see two assholes out of nowhere.

641
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,235
-What do they think?
-They think we know something.

642
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,655
They panic. They got a body,
they've gotta dispose of the evidence.

643
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,740
In my shower?
Come on, you said real life.

644
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:20,245
-They were setting you up, dummy.
-They're not setting me up. Shut up.

645
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,664
You change your tune
every five minutes.

646
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,124
-Kiss me.
-What? No, no, no.

647
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,756
Check out Doris and Lucinda
over here.

648
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,848
These lessons suck.

649
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,269
I quit. This is not being a detective.
Corpses floating in lakes...

650
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,481
...people kissing people. This is wrong.
This is every shade of wrong.

651
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,817
Somebody wanna fill me in?

652
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,404
She thinks I'm a detective,
so go along with it.

653
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,989
-What?
-Don't fuck me up.

654
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,658
Hey.

655
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,744
Do you know the cops
are looking for you, Harry?

656
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,246
-They are?
-Yeah.

657
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,416
I sent them to the wrong room.
I didn't know what else to do.

658
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,127
You did fine.
Perry and I, we're just--

659
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,879
-Hiya, Perry.
-We're just running, you know, a game.

660
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,756
Perry, what do you call it?

661
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:18,303
The old Bring Them In and Push
Them Out. That's what we're doing.

662
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,804
What's going on?

663
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,890
Why are you and Perry nacking
on each other?

664
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,273
I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet
tomorrow to go over her case...

665
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,609
...and, B, I wasn't actually gay.

666
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,111
Do not ask me how I did B.

667
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,405
Why didn't we just leave it there?

668
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,866
Think, dummy.
A 91 1 call from your hotel room...

669
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,702
...all of a sudden,
there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.

670
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,331
Speaking of bad ideas, what's this
about you taking on your own case?

671
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,625
Of all the dipshit things to do.

672
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,335
Killed herself, by the way.

673
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,545
Killed herself.
I solved your case for you.

674
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,715
-Harmony's convinced--
-I don't care about-- Listen to me.

675
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,177
-Little sis punched her own ticket.
-Okay. Gotcha.

676
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,680
All right, this looks good up ahead.
Time to lose the luggage.

677
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,273
Sorry, sweetheart.

678
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,400
You deserved better.

679
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,330
Before I left,
I got her into foster care.

680
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,167
I've never told you just how awful he
treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.

681
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,253
I'll tell you what,
I take notes, in general...

682
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:39,008
...so if you're just real specific,
thorough and precise, that'll help.

683
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,178
I remember only lying to her one time.

684
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,763
I said to her:

685
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,016
"Maybe the man who is living here
is not your father."

686
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,936
You told your sister
she was adopted, yeah?

687
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,355
No, I did one better.

688
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,565
I told her her real father
was an actor...

689
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,276
...who was in the movie
that came through town.

690
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,196
-Jonny Gossamer--
-Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right.

691
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,282
I told Jenna one day she'd go
to Hollywood...

692
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,327
...and she'd meet her famous,
real father.

693
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,176
She believed me, Harry,
and she came out here looking for him.

694
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,555
Okay, this is a bunch.
I can start my...

695
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,182
-...process, I guess.
-Thank you.

696
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,310
I'm on the case. Here is my card.

697
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,732
-It's a magic card, so....
-Wow, "the Amazing Harold."

698
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,985
-Just say "abracadabra."
-What happened, somebody sue you?

699
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,071
It used to be "alakazam"
when you cut me in half.

700
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,866
And, not to be picky,
but it was "Harold the Great."

701
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,703
No, I used to be great,
now I'm amazing. Get with it.

702
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,373
Hi, it's me. You hear anything?

703
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,500
No, there's nothing
in the papers, so....

704
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,336
I'm busy working on Harmony's case.

705
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,921
What case? Leave her alone.

706
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,341
News on Channel 5, just starting.
Call me after.

707
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,053
--a kidnapping gone wrong.
It is unclear why his daughter...

708
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,139
...was subsequently murdered
or where...

709
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,059
...for she was almost certainly killed
and then movedp police sources say.

710
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,062
Veronica Dexter was reported missing
yesterday afternoon...

711
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,940
...when she failed to greet
her boyfriend at the airport.

712
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,319
Miss Dexter recently made headlines
when she returned from Paris...

713
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,822
...and withdrew her multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against her father...

714
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,700
...actor-turned-entrepreneur
Harlan Dexter.

715
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,036
Mr. Dexter owns
the prestigious Dexter Clinic.

716
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,790
His wife died last spring,
prompting Veronica's return to the U .S...

717
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,752
...and a father-daughter reconciliation
following years of estrangement.

718
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:42,215
Veronica Dexter,
25 years old yesterday. Paul.

719
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,759
We were just at that party.
Are you telling me...

720
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,553
...that the girl in the lake,
that was Veronica Dexter?

721
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,514
Positive ID, scars, dental records.

722
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,308
-You talked to your police guy?
-Yeah, not much there.

723
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,353
The lab report came back,
no sign of rape.

724
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,230
Boils down to this:

725
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,359
Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon
about 4:30, left her home.

726
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,238
Went off to the airport, pick up
some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.

727
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,991
-That was the last anybody saw of her?
-With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.

728
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,660
Police ever find the car?

729
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,954
No, genius, that was us. Remember?

730
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,622
Oh, yeah, right.

731
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,667
-The killers were at the party, Harry.
-They were?

732
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,045
-The killers were at Dexter's?
-That's how they recognized you.

733
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,423
It's getting too scary. You gotta bail.
Get a flight out, today.

734
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,718
But I got my screen test Tuesday.
I'll go Wednesday.

735
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,763
-You're not getting the part.
-Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.

736
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,683
-I know it's a long shot.
-You're not gonna get the part.

737
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,435
You're not listening to me.
You won't get the-- Harry!

738
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:41,357
You're not gonna get the part, okay?
Colin Farrell wants too much money.

739
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,067
Do you get me now?

740
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:47,488
Dabney, he unearths a discovery.
New kid, works for cheap.

741
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,116
Flies him out here,
high profile, parties...

742
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,327
...screen tests,
detective lessons, all of it.

743
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,871
You were just being used.

744
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,707
Shave a couple million
off of Colin Farrell's price tag.

745
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,919
Sorry, chief. There it is.

746
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,213
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

747
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,802
I understand if you wanna
take a swing at me. You fuck!

748
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,721
You sissy bitch!

749
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,264
Stop.

750
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,558
Don't bother asking Harmony out
on your date.

751
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,563
She wasn't very happy to find out that
you're not a detective, that you lied.

752
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,607
-You told her?
-Pick those up.

753
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,442
Pick them up.

754
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,987
Why did you tell her?
You didn't have to tell her.

755
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,157
-I am an idiot. I thought we were friends.
-We're not friends.

756
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,744
-I was in trouble, you were there for me.
-No, I was-- Stop speaking.

757
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,705
I was there protecting
my employer, Dabney. Hello.

758
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,082
He pays me to insulate him
from corpses.

759
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,299
I'm not a nice man, Harry.

760
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,927
Go home before something bad
happens to you.

761
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,471
-What, are you threatening me?
-No, moron.

762
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,223
Go home before the bad guys
do something bad to you.

763
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,309
Right, I get it. Fine.

764
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,228
Merry Christmas.
Sorry I fucked you over.

765
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,565
No problem. Don't quit your gay job.

766
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,997
Arriving passengers
from flight number 758 from Denver...

767
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,750
...may retrieve their baggage
at carousel two.

768
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,800
Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry.

769
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,094
Remember me?
What's up, honey? How are you?

770
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,805
-She doesn't want to talk to you.
-Oh, no, no. I know.

771
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,474
Did you ever think maybe
I don't want to talk to her?

772
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,935
I just saw your really distinctive ears.

773
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,312
You look different,
but it's obviously Flicka.

774
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,815
-Maybe it's you I'm interested in.
-Is that true?

775
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,943
Not really. Look, she must have
a cell phone, right? She must.

776
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,697
-Forget it. This is between you two.
-Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving.

777
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,658
I'm going back to the East Coast,
and that's--

778
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,619
No? Come on,
I just want to say something to her.

779
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:02,581
Just anything before I split.
I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.

780
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,750
-I'm gonna regret this.
-No, you're not...

781
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,586
...and that is a very smart suit,
by the way.

782
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,174
-It's not here, that's funny.
-What's funny?

783
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,260
Nothing.
It's just under her stage name.

784
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,847
Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name.
What's her stage name?

785
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,808
Ames. Allison Ames.

786
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,185
Okay, well, I'll just write it down
and then--

787
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,479
Hey! Say that name again.

788
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,691
-Allison Ames.
-Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.

789
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,901
-That's her stage name.
-I just said that.

790
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,778
That's the name on her credit cards.

791
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,574
-How am I supposed to know?
-Fuck! Thanks, honey. Gotta roll.

792
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,409
Later.

793
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,372
You have reached the offices
of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.

794
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,876
Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames,
it was the little sister.

795
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,794
Repeat, the little sister.

796
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,880
That's where Harmony's
2 grand went.

797
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,257
It's in your bank,
you overpriced bastard.

798
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,176
Her kid sister hired you.

799
00:50:55,343 --> 00:51:00,973
Do you get this? Your case and my case
are the same fucking case.

800
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,684
-Come on!
-Get out of my life!

801
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,563
I'm at the airport, right,
and I run into Flicka, and she says--

802
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,233
-Did I just cut off your finger?
-Yeah.

803
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:16,030
It's on the floor, to my periph-- I don't
wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice.

804
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,865
Thanks.

805
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,706
You're a genius, Harry.
You're a genius.

806
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,251
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail
on you, but I had to go to work.

807
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,046
I am going nuts here.
I can't stop thinking about this.

808
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,840
What's my sister's connection
to Veronica Dexter?

809
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,803
She predicted that murder, Harry. She
sent you and Perry to that exact spot.

810
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,099
That whole thing is wild. You know what
else is nuts? You cut off my finger!

811
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:47,353
Oh, God, Harry,
I am so sorry about that. How is it?

812
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,272
It's fine. It's all shut up.
They gave me painkillers.

813
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,275
-Where's Perry? We gotta find him.
-Perry's coming by here.

814
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,194
I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza.

815
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,697
Remember you said the killer may have
been at Dexter's party?

816
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,868
-Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.
-Honey, put me on the list, I'll drop by.

817
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:07,331
I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick
out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.

818
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,583
Maybe you could put the hat
in the kettle...

819
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,504
...and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet.
Harry, you sound trashed.

820
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,464
Give me the address. I'm coming.

821
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,219
I showed up mildly whacked
on Demerol...

822
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,180
...thinking Harmony's theory
wasn't so crazy.

823
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,682
Hi.

824
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,685
What if little sis had been murdered
by the same assholes...

825
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,311
...who offed Veronica Dexter?

826
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,522
Remember?
With the ski masks, those dudes.

827
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,440
Then and there, l made a decision.

828
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,902
If it fucking killed me,
I would not stop...

829
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,655
...until I got, like, two more Demerol.

830
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:44,827
No, seriously, I was on the case.
Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.

831
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,139
-I got it.
-What do you got?

832
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,392
Just now. My friend Tiff
does the video dubbing at Fox.

833
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,022
-"Lord of the Cock Rings."
-No, Harry, it's a fake label.

834
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,775
Copyright infringement, she'd get fired.
It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.

835
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:21,071
If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad,
this is where she would start, right?

836
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,199
-Jesus, don't patronize me!
-I'm not.

837
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,077
-You're patronizing me.
-No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.

838
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,788
I don't know if this guy's
your boyfriend or not...

839
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,875
...but when you were in the bathroom,
he was checking me out.

840
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:37,379
What? What is it out here
with these women?

841
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,924
Please, they're no different
from anywhere else.

842
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,886
They are. These are damaged goods,
every one of them, from way back.

843
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,431
Take a guy who sleeps with 1 00 women
a year, go into his childhood...

844
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,226
...dollars to doughnuts,
it's relatively unspectacular.

845
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,854
Now, you take one of these gals
who sleeps with 1 00 guys a year...

846
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,649
...and I bet you
if you look in their childhood...

847
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,859
...there's something rotten in Denver.

848
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,111
-Denmark.
-That too. But it's abandonment...

849
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,240
...it's abuse. It's, "My uncle
put his ping-ping in my papa."

850
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,741
Then they all come out here.

851
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,953
It's like someone took America
by the East Coast and shook it...

852
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,330
...and all the normal girls
managed to hang on.

853
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,417
Okay, everybody who hates Harry
here raise their hand.

854
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:20,381
-See that? Obedient little bitches too.
-Fuck you!

855
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,007
Hey.

856
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,803
Okay, you've got 30 of my
fucking seconds, thrill me.

857
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,139
All right, guys, cast list.

858
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:32,017
Catch. That's the credit card
my sister used to hire you.

859
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,437
So who's in this cinematic milestone?

860
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:40,442
-We got a Michael Beck, whoever that is.
-He's the star of Xanadu, with...

861
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,070
-...Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.
-Gay.

862
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,531
-What?
-Nothing.

863
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,034
Perry, listen up. I know this is
a long shot, but indulge me, please.

864
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,578
We gotta lose the hat.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't--

865
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,998
-God, I'm working!
-I know, but just forget it.

866
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,918
Seriously, don't jump all over me.
Just pay attention. Watch it, please.

867
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,545
-That's Harlan Dexter.
-What?

868
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,964
-Who's Har--? What?
-Look, that's--

869
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,800
He's 20 years younger,
but that's Harlan Dexter.

870
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,219
Always sees the inside of a police van.

871
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,264
No way.

872
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,311
This kind of makes sense. He had
the Gossamer books at his house.

873
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,854
Used to be an actor.

874
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,482
I remember him now. 1 980.
Oh, my God, I saw him like this.

875
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,609
-Young.
-Where?

876
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,321
In Indiana. He was there
with the movie crew.

877
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,616
Remember, I told you he looked familiar.
Oh, God, this can't be true.

878
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:34,371
And your sister has to have seen this,
so you know what it comes down to.

879
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,374
You tell your sister a fairy tale
about her real father--

880
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,086
And 20 years later, she comes out
to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.

881
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,176
I've got a surveillance
in MacArthur Park.

882
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,096
I gotta follow some chick around
till midnight. Do not play detective.

883
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,349
This is not a book. This is not a movie.

884
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,309
We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?

885
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,561
You wouldn't know where
to feed yourself...

886
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:02,649
...if you didn't flap your mouth so much.
Yes, I think you're stupid.

887
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,363
Harry, don't listen to a word he says,
all right? We're getting somewhere.

888
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,907
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going back to work.

889
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,075
Good.

890
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,552
-Excuse me.
-What's up, baby? How you feeling?

891
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,430
-I'm just gonna--
-Come and take a walk. Walk with me.

892
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,766
Great, this is fucking rich.

893
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,145
Well, now, here we all are:

894
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:44,191
-Ike, Mike and Mustard.
-What the hell does that mean?

895
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,236
I'm with him on this one.
That's pretty fucking obscure.

896
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,279
-I hear that all the time.
-You do?

897
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,657
-Yeah, sure.
-Where? At the 1 942 Club?

898
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,828
-Just because you didn't get it--
-Motherfucker, I could-- Slow your roll.

899
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:59,331
This is bullshit. What will you do,
take me out here? There's sec--

900
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,543
-Keep talking. Keep talking.
-You wanna know who we are?

901
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,504
I'm the frying pan, see?
And my boy over here--

902
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,257
He's Mustard.
I'm Mustard, baby.

903
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,800
-Sure.
-He's the fire.

904
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,095
-Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.
-Here we go.

905
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,557
Now, me and my man, we're puzzled
lately by your behavior, such as--

906
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:22,521
Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat
like yourself consorting with gay men?

907
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,191
Frolicking in the lake together.
What is that?

908
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,610
You're the guys
who were wearing the masks.

909
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,072
-You don't ask the questions.
-Don't ask questions.

910
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,576
God, you just tore up my fucking
finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!

911
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,662
I bet there's a doctor in New York,
clear that shit right up.

912
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,414
Clear it right up.

913
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,046
L.A. don't want you no more,
tough guy.

914
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,132
All right?

915
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,386
-How much further to the hospital?
-Five minutes away.

916
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,389
Talk to me. Our mascot,
back in high school, who was it?

917
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,808
Come on, Harry, stay with me.

918
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,228
Whitey, the white knight. Whitey.

919
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,647
I guess it's better
than calling him "Knighty."

920
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,485
Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon
it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.

921
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:13,280
-It's very emasculating.
-Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.

922
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,033
You said it's a black guy
and a white guy?

923
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,243
You're right.
Get the plate, call the cops.

924
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,455
-Let me find a pen.
-No. Whatever. Watch the road.

925
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,123
Are we slowing down?

926
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,418
-No, I'm getting a pen.
-Are you following them? Better not be.

927
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,255
-Tell me you're not following them.
-I'm taking you to the hospital.

928
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,467
-Oh, shit. They're turning.
-What?

929
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,968
Holy shit.

930
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:40,516
Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're
going to MacArthur Park after Perry!

931
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,685
Wait a second! My finger's hanging off.
We gotta move on this.

932
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,563
We're gonna go save Perry,
really quickly.

933
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,357
Then we'll go fix your finger.

934
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:52,194
It'll be like, "Hey, Perry, look out."
Boom, back in the car. All right?

935
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,322
-Cool?
-Yeah. This is exhausting.

936
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,034
Bingo. All right. All right, Harry.

937
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,329
Twelve o'clock, that's them.
One of them is on foot.

938
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:11,004
God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys,
can you take yourself to the hospital?

939
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,798
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-All right, good.

940
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,342
-I got the gun you gave me.
-You what?

941
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,984
Perry!

942
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,237
Now, where you going?

943
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,076
No, no, no. Don't fight it.

944
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,330
Let it happen, baby.

945
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,990
Perry!

946
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,416
Perry, watch out!
Goddamn it, turn around!

947
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,970
Son of a bitch!

948
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:35,107
How about that, you fucking animals!
Goddamn cocksuckers.

949
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,132
-Perry.
-Where the hell did you come from?

950
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,509
-He got away.
-It's okay. You did good.

951
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:06,430
-I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.
-You did fine. You did fine.

952
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,223
We gotta go now.

953
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,074
Hello?

954
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,004
Anyone home?

955
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,763
Hello?

956
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:54,102
Anyone home?
I got an injury problem. Hello.

957
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,689
All right, first things first.
You've gotta ditch that car.

958
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,233
I know, I know. I've--

959
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:04,654
I know you said that there was
gonna be consequences, but fuck.

960
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,823
I saw him shot to death.

961
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:11,912
-I was scared.
-Look, it's okay, yeah.

962
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:16,666
We can absolutely
talk about it, all right?

963
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,211
Thank you. Thank you so much.

964
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,047
It's nothing against your boss.
I'm grateful. I just--

965
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,548
I spoke to him.

966
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,551
You'll never have to go through anything
like that again.

967
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,470
I swear.

968
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,931
Promise?

969
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,641
Yep.

970
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:47,405
Who are you?

971
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,784
Who--?

972
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,954
Well, hey.

973
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,252
So you still here, huh, tough guy?

974
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,463
Oh, you got a gun, I see.

975
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,884
Well, damn, you are tough.

976
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,143
Sorry.

977
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,408
Fuck.

978
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,922
Hey. Hey!

979
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,215
Sit.

980
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,933
-Yeah? What?
-Where the hell are you?

981
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,812
I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of
them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.

982
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,313
Come here, you fuck.

983
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,607
Wipe the place clean
and get out of there.

984
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,317
I want to, but I can't.

985
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,904
-So do it.
-My fingerprint's here. The dog's got it.

986
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:37,283
-No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.
-He's got the finger, asshole...

987
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:40,537
-...with the print part.
-Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.

988
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,747
Hang on.

989
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,459
Shit. Well, I think....

990
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,712
I think we're safe.

991
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,714
Harry?

992
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,010
-Harry?
-Hey, Perry, I shot a guy.

993
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,887
I never did that before.

994
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,057
Harry, listen--

995
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,652
--link to the items found
in the Silver Lake home...

996
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,405
...to the kidnap-murder
of socialite Veronica Dexter.

997
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,241
Police theorize a falling out
between the kidnappers...

998
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,619
...resulting in at least two deaths,
and possibly a third tonight.

999
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,956
So this evening,
was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?

1000
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,710
To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer
always has a way bigger ending.

1001
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,379
There's always the part
where the guy gets tortured.

1002
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:35,467
Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually
breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.

1003
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:39,095
Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16.
That's funny.

1004
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:47,562
So this thing, it's over, right? They say
the kidnappers are all dead, so....

1005
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,315
Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you
if I didn't say...

1006
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,026
...that I still didn't have
a few questions.

1007
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,736
Harmony's sister.

1008
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,156
If she stumbles on a murder plot,
why hire me to film it?

1009
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,367
-Why not simply go to the police?
-Right. And I still think...

1010
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,579
...this Veronica Dexter
father-daughter business is wanky.

1011
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,749
So the whole reconcilement thing?

1012
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,626
"Reconciliation," idiot.

1013
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:14,047
She comes back to the States, drops
the lawsuit, moves in with her father.

1014
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,050
-Suddenly they're inseparable?
-So, what are you saying?

1015
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,469
We're gonna, like, probe deeper?

1016
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,304
-Absolutely not.
-What?

1017
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,723
What are you talking about?
My sister paid you.

1018
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,101
-What, you're gonna bail?
-Harmony...

1019
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,520
...do you want your sister's
money back? Done.

1020
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,189
In the meantime, back off.

1021
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,233
Before you get me and Harry killed.

1022
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,124
Pardon me.

1023
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,459
Hey, I lucked out.
They gave me the same room.

1024
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,129
-Lucky you.
-It's pretty good. You wanna come up?

1025
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,173
No, I don't wanna come up.
Why would I go up there?

1026
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,260
-They cleaned it.
-The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.

1027
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,933
You know what, Harry? Stop.

1028
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,103
Why'd you lie to me?

1029
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,025
It was an excuse to stay around you.
So I think, in the realm of lies--

1030
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,902
You are such a dumb-ass.

1031
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:23,032
-I am so not who you think I am, Harry.
-And who would that be?

1032
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,869
You think I'm-- You think I'm amazing.

1033
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,580
You do. You think I'm so amazing...

1034
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,832
...because that's who
I told you I'd be.

1035
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,584
Yeah, that was the game plan.

1036
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,461
-You know what? It worked.
-No one else thinks so.

1037
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,965
-My opinion doesn't count?
-No, it doesn't.

1038
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,550
Because you're new here.

1039
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,677
Look around,
there's younger and better.

1040
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,263
I don't want younger and better,
I want you.

1041
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,640
I'm such a moron. I'm sorry.
You know what--

1042
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,852
-It doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just--
-I'm such an idiot.

1043
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,066
I steal shit.

1044
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,821
-Come again?
-That's what I do for a living.

1045
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,740
I steal audio-visual components.

1046
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,243
I steal. I robbed a house.
I stole this watch.

1047
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:11,289
It's a cool watch. It's got this
little light thing. I stole this gum...

1048
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:15,001
...from the lobby,
because it was kind of a rush.

1049
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:20,506
I've never finished anything
that I've started my entire life.

1050
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,802
Not school, not marriage, nothing.

1051
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,932
And I have this thing where,
like halfway in the middle, I just...

1052
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,892
...and I cut and run.

1053
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,062
Like the other night
when you were all over me...

1054
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,397
...and you gave up
and just went for it with--

1055
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,235
Prime example. I switched to the ugly
friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.

1056
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,654
She's homely.

1057
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:47,450
Don't go. Please.

1058
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,327
Not yet.

1059
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,120
This isn't finished.

1060
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,256
-Turn around.
-Why?

1061
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,133
-Just turn around.
-What, my tag's out?

1062
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:07,762
-This dump have a bar?
-Yeah.

1063
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:11,015
-Call me "Slick" from here on out.
-That was such a good job.

1064
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,059
You snagged a ton of gum.

1065
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:16,354
-I mean, petty theft--
-Oh, Harry.

1066
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:20,441
I really didn't need
that last shot of tequila.

1067
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,653
Oh, God.

1068
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,377
I just had a weird thought.

1069
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:43,214
Veronica Dexter. I saw the body
up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing.

1070
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,759
Both times, the dress was soaked
through, so it was transparent. So--

1071
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:49,512
God, Harry,
where are you going with this?

1072
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,723
No, no, no. It's just--

1073
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,310
Perry said this chick was deep
into the born-again bit...

1074
01:11:55,477 --> 01:12:00,690
...so it's probably nothing,
but just if she had on underwear...

1075
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,652
...I didn't see any.

1076
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:10,325
-I guess I'm taking the couch.
-Yeah. Thanks.

1077
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:14,996
Or you can sleep here.
But it would only be sleeping, Harry.

1078
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,792
If that's gonna frustrate you.

1079
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,295
Let's see.

1080
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,055
Oh, Harry.

1081
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,933
So long ago.

1082
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,398
Didn't really turn out
the way we hoped, did it?

1083
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:49,322
I guess if I racked my brain,
I could think of worse places to be.

1084
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:55,495
-Is that so, Whitey?
-Whitey?

1085
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,830
-Calling me a knight?
-Maybe, yeah.

1086
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:01,042
Except for the boner.
That's not too knightly.

1087
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,379
The hell it isn't.
Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.

1088
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,804
Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry.

1089
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,473
I'm thinking--
I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...

1090
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,934
-...the couch is good.
-What? Stop. Harry.

1091
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,144
Or I can keep drinking
until it goes away.

1092
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,772
Harry, seriously,
if you're at all uncomfortable...

1093
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,233
...I am more than happy
to do something.

1094
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:26,943
-For chrissake, no.
-Why not?

1095
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,238
I don't want you to offer it as--
Not, "It's a courtesy freebie."

1096
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,490
-You're so anal.
-I don't want the backup:

1097
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,576
"Let me just give you a hand here"...

1098
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:41,165
...as a kind of, like,
default backup thing.

1099
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,897
You're gonna stop calling me.

1100
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,899
No. You know, that's crazy.

1101
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,901
I swear to God, this is it.

1102
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,654
You are the dream girl.
You always have been.

1103
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,323
This is destiny.

1104
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,659
Okay.

1105
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,792
Before we do this...

1106
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,753
...I have a little confession to make.

1107
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,967
My best friend! You said you were going
to drop by his house, wave goodbye.

1108
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,636
I was leaving for L.A.
I was never gonna see him--

1109
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,472
-He looked sad.
-He looked sad?

1110
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,974
-Yes, he did.
-You slept with Chook Chutney.

1111
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,685
Fuck. For chrissake, Harry,
it was forever ago.

1112
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,021
Come on,
I was a different person back then.

1113
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,482
-You slept with Chook. Excuse me.
-Come on.

1114
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,609
-Watch your hand.
-Harry!

1115
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,736
-Yeah.
-Harry, was she raped?

1116
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,031
The Dexter girl, was she raped?

1117
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,536
No, the ME's report showed no
indication of rape stuff.

1118
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,496
You slept with Chook Chutney.

1119
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:05,226
Wake up. Harry, wake up.

1120
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,021
-Get up.
-What's up?

1121
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:11,649
Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed.

1122
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,442
Let's go.

1123
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:18,906
Perry, it's me. Listen,
this Veronica Dexter business stinks.

1124
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,284
I'm gonna go
check on something Harry said.

1125
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,494
Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.

1126
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,830
-What did you say to her?
-Nothing.

1127
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,083
-I don't get what's happening.
-She solved this thing.

1128
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:33,713
That sly little minx of yours has solved
this case, and now I can't find her.

1129
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,923
-You're worried.
-You're not worried?

1130
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,800
Of course. If you are, I should be.

1131
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,802
Now, what did you say? Think.

1132
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,930
-You said something about the case.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1133
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,807
What?

1134
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,065
I tell him about destiny.
He's shaking his head.

1135
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:57,194
About dream girls, he doesn't care.
I mention the underwear thing...

1136
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,988
...he has a fucking conniption.

1137
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,198
And you?
How about it, filmgoer?

1138
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,828
Have you solved the case
of the dead people in L.A.?

1139
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,581
Times Square audiences,
don't shout at the screen.

1140
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,459
And stop picking at that,
it'll just get worse.

1141
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,964
-This won't take a second.
-Right.

1142
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,521
Hi. How are you doing tonight?

1143
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:34,649
They gave away my crickets.

1144
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:42,907
Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance,
happen to have seen this woman?

1145
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,952
No. I don't like him.
Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.

1146
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,537
Of course. That's sad.

1147
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:52,041
Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended
when I ask you...

1148
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,670
...if you're wearing anything at all
underneath your hospital blues.

1149
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:59,507
Any undergarments. It's important.

1150
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,980
That's the clue.
Veronica Dexter was a patient here.

1151
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:18,651
Private mental clinic,
where even nice girls don't wear undies.

1152
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,987
How could she be here and meanwhile,
she's out having parties?

1153
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:26,325
Think. First she hates her dad, then loves
him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why?

1154
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,828
-I'll tell you why.
-Oh, my God.

1155
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,126
Oh, my God.
So it's two different girls, right?

1156
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,838
He stashed his daughter in here,
and then he put the ringer on the street.

1157
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,174
He needs someone who looks like her
to withdraw the complaint.

1158
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,468
-It's been 1 0 years.
-This is nuts.

1159
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,054
-It's right out of a Gossamer book.
-Of course...

1160
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,099
...because the guy who planned
the crimes has all the books.

1161
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:54,812
He's read them all. They're in his house.
Plus, he was in that piece of shit...

1162
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,731
...movie.

1163
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,608
You're telling me the girl imposter--

1164
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,986
A desperate man needs
a replacement daughter.

1165
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,196
Along comes a girl, Harmony's sister.

1166
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:08,117
-Fresh off the bus, looking for her dad.
-I'd say I found my imposter.

1167
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,453
Let's get out of here.

1168
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:15,374
-So where did she go from here?
-Shut up, I'm thinking.

1169
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,042
By the way, this thing:

1170
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,211
Single gayest thing you've ever done.

1171
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,339
-Evening, gentlemen.
-Hi, we are so incredibly lost.

1172
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,175
Mr. Van Shrike, hello.

1173
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,719
You look chilly. Come back inside.

1174
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,430
I'm from back East.
I'm kind of digging the cold.

1175
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:33,434
-Fuck! He's the one who said it.
-Or I can kill you here.

1176
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:40,733
Harry, I was thinking some more
about this reality versus fiction.

1177
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:45,780
Like in the movies, when a guy sticks
a gun at some schmuck's back and says:

1178
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:49,116
-"Let's take a walk." He's got a hostage.
-I've seen that movie.

1179
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,787
In reality, the pros like about
five feet of separation.

1180
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:56,832
That's so the schmuck doesn't take
the gun back and make him eat it.

1181
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:02,254
Doesn't that suck?
I just hit you for no reason.

1182
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,673
Watch it.

1183
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,556
-Tell us where Harmony is.
-Fuck you, mary.

1184
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,810
You don't get it, do you?
This isn't "good cop, bad cop."

1185
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:19,688
This is fag and New Yorker.
You're in a lot of trouble.

1186
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:24,401
For chrissake, who are you protecting?
It's all over. Dexter is going down.

1187
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,862
-Down.
-I know about Veronica's lawsuit.

1188
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:30,324
I know Dexter was facing ruin.
I even know he switched daughters.

1189
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,828
Which, for God's sake, actually
did work for a while, till last week.

1190
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:36,622
-Then he had to kill her, huh?
-Put a sock in it.

1191
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,124
-I'm asking a question.
-If you ask questions...

1192
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:41,961
...then it seems like
we don't know anything. Okay?

1193
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:45,047
And for the record, it was the boyfriend,
the guy from Paris.

1194
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,884
He would've spotted the fake and said,
"That's not Veronica." Am I right?

1195
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:51,178
-Fuck you!
-Exactly.

1196
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,973
So Dexter had Veronica killed,
threw a dress on her...

1197
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,643
...dumped the body and walked away
clean, except for one little thing.

1198
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,021
-Underpants.
-One tiny little pair of undies.

1199
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,690
Yeah.

1200
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,902
You think that's funny, huh?
I'm gonna break your nose now.

1201
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:11,073
I want you to picture a bullet inside
your head. Can you do that for me?

1202
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,117
Fuck you.

1203
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,036
-Anyway, that's ambiguous.
-Ambiguous? I don't think so.

1204
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,831
He means when you say,
"Picture it inside your head"...

1205
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,333
...is that "a bullet
will be inside your head"...

1206
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,336
-...or "picture it in your head"?
-Harry, will you shut up.

1207
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:27,673
I don't know anything about a girl,
seriously. I was bluffing.

1208
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:32,094
-I think that you are bluffing right now.
-Harry, what are you doing?

1209
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,555
What I'm doing for the guy
who likes to bluff...

1210
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:40,144
...is I'm playing a little game called
"Am I Bluffing?" Where is she?

1211
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:42,980
Where the fuck is Harmony?
You want to play hardball?

1212
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:45,941
Where is the girl?

1213
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,027
What did you just do?

1214
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,697
-I just put in one bullet, didn't I?
-You put a live round in that gun?

1215
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,658
Yeah, there was like
an 8 percent chance.

1216
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:58,412
-Eight? Who taught you math?
-Maybe it was more. I don't know--

1217
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,789
Shit!

1218
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,417
-Hello?
-Perry, is that you?

1219
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,586
-Hey, it's me.
-Hi, Harmony.

1220
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,546
-What's going on?
-Where are you?

1221
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,214
-At home.
-You're at home?

1222
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:12,426
I just got back. I was in the Hills
all day. Shitty reception.

1223
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,888
-You don't sound so good.
-Why aren't you following your lead?

1224
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,098
Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.

1225
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,184
No, it's not crazy. Listen--

1226
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:23,771
-It's right out of a Gossamer book.
-Don't talk. Listen.

1227
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,148
-Eight percent.
-And you, stop multiplying.

1228
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:29,026
No, not you. Listen, call downtown...

1229
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,987
...see if Veronica Dexter's body
has gone to the mortuary.

1230
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,531
If it has, see if there's
a cremation scheduled.

1231
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,826
-Wait, Perry.
-Call me back right away.

1232
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,207
Look, he was gonna kill you anyway.
He said so.

1233
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,921
Cover him up. I'll get the car.

1234
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:54,551
-All right, that's pretty much all done.
-Harry--

1235
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:59,848
I got an idea. I say we take
the son of a bitch Dexter down.

1236
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,354
To the racetrack and buy
the son of a gun a drink.

1237
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:10,192
What do you say, Perry?
Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.

1238
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,612
Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike
a little pat down.

1239
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:24,164
Fucking maricón.

1240
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:30,045
Toss it here. Let's see who it is.

1241
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,924
We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.

1242
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,098
He just asked a carpet-cleaning service
to save him.

1243
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,143
Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.

1244
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,396
Thanks. Used to be a magician.

1245
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:52,526
And for 39.99 we'll carpet
up to three rooms in half the time.

1246
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,155
That's a $40 value. Act today.

1247
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,411
That chick in the casket,
she won't even match up with that...

1248
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:05,622
...ringer you been toting around.
You ever think about that?

1249
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,417
He did, Harry.
That's why he's cremating the body.

1250
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,587
Yeah, you ready?

1251
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,300
Speak of the devil. Gotta go.

1252
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:20,054
Perry, nice to have known you.

1253
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,347
-Harry.
-Harry. Yes, of course.

1254
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:23,891
Harry from New York.

1255
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,228
I hope you don't judge Los Angeles
based solely on your experience tonight.

1256
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:38,655
I'm kind of scared here, Perry.

1257
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:41,200
Aurelio, why don't you give
the kid a break?

1258
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,911
Do unto others and all that.
It's Christmas.

1259
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,246
-Who else knows?
-I don't know anything.

1260
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,707
I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.

1261
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,472
Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.

1262
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,350
Okay, let's burn the bitch.

1263
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,355
You could zap his chest.
It'd be easier.

1264
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,565
But we know why you gotta do
it down there.

1265
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:15,943
You like looking at his johnson,
don't you?

1266
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,903
Admit it, dude, you got it in you.

1267
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:25,744
Enough! Look me in the eyes and
tell me you've never been with a man.

1268
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:29,164
-Fuck you, maricón! Fuck you!
-That's what you want, isn't it?

1269
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,501
-You want to fuck me.
-Stop helping. Stop helping.

1270
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,420
-If you are not gay, just say so.
-Fuck you, maricón!

1271
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,508
-Look at him. He can't even say it.
-Stop helping!

1272
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:42,302
-Can't wait to have you as a patient.
-Bet you can't.

1273
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:44,429
-This is what you want. Here.
-Shut up!

1274
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,641
Take a look. You want some of this
right here? Look at this.

1275
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,059
Just shut up!

1276
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:54,481
Yeah!

1277
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,611
Homophobes never check there.

1278
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:04,741
Thank God you had a gun in there.
I thought it was a gay thing...

1279
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,703
...like somehow
you guys could do that. Sorry.

1280
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,914
-Are you okay?
-Not really, no.

1281
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,917
Gentlemen, let's wrap it up
and get out of here.

1282
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:19,464
-Who's driving?
-I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.

1283
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:21,466
All right.

1284
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,973
-This way, come on.
-Shit!

1285
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,523
-Yeah.
-Hey, Harmony, it's me.

1286
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,692
Oh, God, how did you get away?

1287
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,570
I shot him with a small revolver
I keep near my balls.

1288
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:45,574
I can't get to my car. We're near Olive
and the freeway. Can you pick us up?

1289
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:48,577
I'm in a van with the body.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1290
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:51,496
All right, be where I can see you.
Be ready to move.

1291
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:56,627
Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.

1292
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:11,141
Right there. She's right there! Shit.

1293
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:39,711
Harmony!

1294
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,229
-Harmony!
-Harry, don't!

1295
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:29,803
Come on, we gotta go. They're coming
back around. Harmony's down there.

1296
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:35,642
Perry, what's wrong?

1297
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,104
Come on, breathe.

1298
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,954
Harry.

1299
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,628
Harold.

1300
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,863
Harold...

1301
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,533
...use your awesome might.

1302
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:37,245
Save me from this hopeless plight.

1303
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,333
Harold....

1304
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:33,343
Harmony!

1305
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,526
Captain Fucking Magic.

1306
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,783
Come on!

1307
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,464
No.

1308
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:21,391
There, all done.

1309
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,644
Finished.

1310
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:35,655
Harry.

1311
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:41,620
-Did you call me?
-Harry, you're shot.

1312
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:44,206
No, no. Look, you want
to see something cool?

1313
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:50,587
Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry.

1314
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,096
No, not really.

1315
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,432
Oh, Harry.

1316
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:05,268
Oh, God, Harry.

1317
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,814
Harry.

1318
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:23,954
-Hi. Welcome back.
-Yeah.

1319
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:29,417
-How many fingers?
-Put that cat down, because I'm allergic.

1320
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,838
You feeling okay? How's your...?

1321
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:36,341
-My what?
-Well, your....

1322
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,053
-Everything down there.
-I can't believe he told you that.

1323
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,683
It's Christmas,
where's my present, Slick?

1324
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,102
Your present is you're not in jail,
fag-hag.

1325
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:50,063
Yeah, boo, hiss, I know.
Look, I hate it too.

1326
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,650
In movies where the studio gets all
paranoid about a downer ending...

1327
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:57,696
...so the guy shows up, he's magically
alive on crutches, I hate that.

1328
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:00,991
I mean, shit,
why not bring them all back.

1329
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:05,954
But the point is, in this case,
this time, it really happened.

1330
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,707
Perry, like, lived.
Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing...

1331
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:11,501
...but what do you want me to do,
lie about it?

1332
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,461
So you found something out?

1333
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:16,756
Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.

1334
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,385
Dexter didn't murder your sister.

1335
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:25,223
That's crazy. He was using my sister
to impersonate his daughter, Perry.

1336
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,101
Never happened.
I talked to my police guy.

1337
01:33:29,478 --> 01:33:35,692
The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye,
23-year-old from Glendale.

1338
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:38,320
When she wasn't impersonating
Veronica Dexter...

1339
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,697
...she wore a pink wig.

1340
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:47,162
But my sister sent you up
to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.

1341
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:52,626
Your sister was convinced
that Dexter was her natural father...

1342
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:55,337
...so she started following him,
hanging around.

1343
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,048
Do you see where I'm going with this?

1344
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,426
One day your sister came calling,
and she saw Dexter...

1345
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:03,511
...in bed with the pink-haired girl.

1346
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,389
What she thought
was father and daughter.

1347
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,808
Remember,
that's how it would appear.

1348
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,393
It was too much for her.

1349
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:14,981
First the old father,
now the shiny new one.

1350
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:20,153
She couldn't handle it,
and she took her own life.

1351
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:24,824
What she hired me to film
wasn't murder, but incest.

1352
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:29,329
I'm sorry.

1353
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,498
So much for unreality.

1354
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,124
I said goodbye...

1355
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:37,128
...watched Jonny's world
go back on the fiction shelf.

1356
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:39,881
But while it lasted, brother...

1357
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:42,759
...it was one for the books.

1358
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:46,596
You should've told me
you were arrested five times.

1359
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:48,848
I should be pissed.

1360
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:52,686
You should have told me that when you
go home, you put on lady's underpants.

1361
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,938
-That's cross-dressing, imbecile.
-Whatever.

1362
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,817
Half those guys are straight.
Perfect fathers, love their kids.

1363
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,027
How about you?
Did your father love you?

1364
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:05,198
Sometimes. You know, when I dressed
up like a bottle. How about yours?

1365
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,368
Well, he used to beat me in Morse code,
so it's possible...

1366
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,954
...but he never
actually said the words.

1367
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:13,415
-Harry.
-What?

1368
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,917
Don't steal any more shit.

1369
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,878
You're not a punk.

1370
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:23,883
You bet I'll turn around.

1371
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:25,635
You like that, huh?

1372
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:29,055
I saw him in the commissary twice.
What is he, like 6'4"?

1373
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:32,350
He doesn't know he's gay.
Look how he walks.

1374
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,144
So that's pretty much that.

1375
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,272
We went back to Indiana,
the three of us, for Jenna's funeral.

1376
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:41,151
Don't worry,
I saw the last Lord of the Rings.

1377
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:43,069
I won't have the movie end 1 7 times.

1378
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,114
There is, though, one final scene
for your viewing pleasure.

1379
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,834
Do I know you?

1380
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:04,507
No. Just in town for the funeral.

1381
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,301
What do you want?

1382
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:10,638
The zoo was closed, so I thought
I'd come here and look at an animal.

1383
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,348
Son of a--

1384
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:15,351
Who do you think you're talking to?

1385
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,812
I buried my daughter today.

1386
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,148
No.

1387
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,401
You buried her 20 years ago.

1388
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:27,655
Harmony was right,
her sister was murdered.

1389
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:31,785
You pulled the trigger. It just took
this long for the bullet to hit.

1390
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:34,871
Who are you?

1391
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,832
I loved my girl.

1392
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,212
You fucker!
If I could get out of this bed--

1393
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:45,799
Yeah? Well, you can't.

1394
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:49,052
You bastard!

1395
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:55,058
An old man that can't defend himself.

1396
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:57,101
Big tough guy.

1397
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,603
Yeah, that's right.

1398
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,482
Big tough guy.

1399
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:21,376
I prefer Genaros, but what do I know?
I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.

1400
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,555
That's it. That's the true story
of what happened last Christmas.

1401
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:37,392
That was some pretty harsh shit
with the old guy back there, right?

1402
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,520
But whatever, he's creepy.
Fuck him. Don't worry about him.

1403
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,856
Anyhow, so....

1404
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:44,732
Thanks for coming.

1405
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,444
Thanks for taking the trip to L.A.
with me.

1406
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,447
If I had to sum it up,
and I do--

1407
01:37:51,615 --> 01:37:54,033
Because, you know,
it's, like, the end.

1408
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:58,705
--I would say that this movie is about--
It's about friendship.

1409
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,082
-Friendship is sacred.
-What are you doing?

1410
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,959
I'm trying to wrap up the movie...

1411
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,420
...and leave the people
with a message.

1412
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:09,382
I've got a message for you.
Get your feet off my fucking desk.

1413
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,634
Sorry. I work for Perry now.

1414
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:13,511
-And stop narrating.
-Obviously.

1415
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,055
That's it.
Please stay for the end credits.

1416
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:19,601
If you're wondering who the best boy is,
it's someone's nephew.

1417
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,644
Don't forget to validate your parking.

1418
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,022
For all of you good people
in the Midwest...

1419
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:25,773
...sorry we said "fuck" so much.

1420
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:27,734
-Say good night.
-Thanks again.

1421
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,736
Now, go. Vanish.

1422
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,111
