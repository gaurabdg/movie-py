JFK

1
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:21,464
"To sin by silence when we should protest
makes cowards out of men."

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,361
- Ella Wheeler Wilcox

3
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,686
JFK

4
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,396
January, 1961.

5
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,597
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.

6
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,011
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

7
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,673
...in the American experience.

8
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,404
The total influence...

9
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,116
...economic, political, even spiritual...

10
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:20,212
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

11
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:23,582
We must guard against the acquisition...

12
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:27,405
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

13
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:30,293
...by the military-industrial complex.

14
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:33,416
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

15
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:36,371
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

16
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,433
November, 1960.

17
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:42,718
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts...

18
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:46,400
...wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history...

19
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:50,987
...over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.

20
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:55,632
Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...

21
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:59,487
...Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s...

22
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,960
...signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.

23
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,858
"All men are created equal."

24
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:08,139
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

25
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,676
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

26
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,056
Today, the proudest boast is:

27
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,285
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

28
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:20,996
He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...

29
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:24,407
...a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,350
Castro is a successful revolutionary...

31
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:30,820
...frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.

32
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,357
This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion...

33
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,426
...in April, 1961...

34
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:41,322
...when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,878
Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.

36
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,862
He privately claims the CIA lied to him...

37
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:52,294
...and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.

38
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,190
In October, 1962...

39
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,376
...the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war...

40
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,403
...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...

41
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:05,533
...after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...

42
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,903
...90 miles off American shores.

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,118
Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba...

44
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,736
...but at the last moment they turn back.

45
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:16,114
The world breathes with relief.

46
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,301
In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal...

47
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,545
...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...

48
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,952
...not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.

49
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,784
Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.

50
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,865
Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.

51
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,469
We've got our difficulties there.

52
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:41,529
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

53
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:45,332
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

54
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:49,332
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

55
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:51,302
Early that fateful summer...

56
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:54,845
...Kennedy speaks of his new vision
at the American University.

57
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,636
What kind of peace do I mean?

58
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,704
What kind of peace do we seek?

59
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,477
Not a Pax Americana...

60
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,232
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

61
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,475
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

62
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,014
Our most basic, common link...

63
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,553
...is that we all inhabit...

64
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,321
...this small planet.

65
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:17,565
We all breathe the same air.

66
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,334
We all cherish our children's futures.

67
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,604
And we are all mortal.

68
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,745
You fucking assholes!

69
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,309
Don't leave me here!

70
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,820
They've gone to Dallas.

71
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,583
Friday.

72
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,255
They're going to kill...

73
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,075
...Kennedy.

74
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,450
Call somebody.

75
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,004
Stop them.

76
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:05,122
These are serious fucking guys.

77
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:13,558
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

78
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:14,979
Help!

79
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,851
Please!

80
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,996
DALLAS - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

WANTED FOR TREASON

CBS NEWS BULLETIN

83
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,668
Here is a bulletin from CBS News.

84
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,202
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...

85
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,388
...at President Kennedy's motorcade
in downtown Dallas.

86
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,917
The first reports say
that President Kennedy...

87
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,703
...has been seriously wounded
by the shooting.

88
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,630
New Orleans

89
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,440
OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

90
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,158
What's wrong?

91
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,854
The President's been shot.

92
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,300
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

93
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:58,001
Oh, no!

94
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:01,971
How bad?

95
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,913
No word. They think it's in the head.

96
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,295
Napoleon's has a TV set.

97
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:20,638
Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally
also appeared to have been hit.

98
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:25,642
The President was rushed to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, four miles away.

99
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:30,215
We are told the bullet entered the base
of the throat and came out the back...

100
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,659
...but there is no confirmation.

101
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:37,084
Blood transfusions are being given.
A priest has administered the last rites.

102
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,819
There's still a chance.

103
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,045
Pull through, Jack.

104
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,255
From Dallas...

105
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,466
...the flash, apparently official:

106
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,528
President Kennedy died...

107
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,539
...at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time...

108
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,639
...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

109
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,275
...some 38 minutes ago.

110
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,426
Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital.

111
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,397
Presumably he will take
the oath of office shortly...

112
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,355
...and become the 36th President
of the United States.

113
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:21,034
He did so much for this country,
for colored people. Why?

114
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,276
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

115
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,532
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:34,577
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

117
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,777
The President of the United States is dead.

118
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:43,341
I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert
of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.

119
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,382
He told me...

120
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,739
...President Kennedy has been given
the last rites.

121
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,910
Shortly after 12:30...

122
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:56,313
...near the park in downtown Dallas...

123
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,059
...the shots rang out.

124
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,585
The President is dead.

125
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,202
The bullets came up over our heads...

126
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:07,437
...from that fence up on the knoll.

127
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,079
I seen his face when it hit.

128
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,236
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

129
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:20,881
He flopped over on his stomach...

130
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,479
...with his foot sticking out.

131
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:31,665
None of us thought it could happen
in America or any place else.

132
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,187
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

133
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:38,979
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

134
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,599
For God's sake, the President was shot.

135
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,596
A bullshit President!

136
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:48,202
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

137
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:52,274
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

138
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,383
Goddamn peace treaties!

139
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,510
I heard shots from over there.

140
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,491
- I heard shots from over there.
- How many?

141
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,278
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

142
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,320
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

143
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,051
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

144
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,803
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

145
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,266
Bullshit!

146
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,621
Here's to the New Frontier.

147
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,740
Camelot in smithereens.

148
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:24,762
I'll drink to that.

149
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,364
Dallas police have just announced...

150
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:37,465
...they have a suspect in the killing
of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...

151
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,450
...who was shot at 1: 15 in Oak Cliff,
a Dallas suburb.

152
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,971
Police say there could be a tie-in
to the President's murder.

153
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:49,380
The suspect,
identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...

154
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,830
...was arrested by more
than a dozen policemen...

155
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:56,577
...after a short scuffle at a movie theater
in Oak Cliff.

156
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,905
Officer Tippit was killed...

157
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,586
...by a revolver which was found
on Oswald.

158
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,097
Shoot the bastard!

159
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,565
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

160
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:14,912
I don't know what I am charged with...

161
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,538
...but I emphatically deny these charges.

162
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,317
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

163
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:26,084
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

164
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:27,464
Right?

165
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,917
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

166
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,875
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

167
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,228
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,658
Who'd have ever thought...

169
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:44,395
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

170
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,114
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

171
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,055
Am I right, Jack?

172
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,125
Well, bless my soul.

173
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,288
All these years,
I thought you were on my team.

174
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,680
Are you kidding?

175
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,104
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

176
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:07,192
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

177
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,568
Look at that, Martin.

178
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,096
Who's been going through my files?

179
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,601
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

180
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,289
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

181
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,571
You went through all my files!

182
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,398
You're a goddamn spy!

183
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,007
Why would I want to look
through your files?

184
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,173
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

185
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,498
I always lock my files!

186
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,917
You're the only one here today.

187
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,863
What do you mean, you bastard?

188
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,547
You're going to write a book?

189
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,473
You know what I mean.

190
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,738
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

191
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:59,702
Strange people.

192
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:10,512
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

193
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,263
Not a goddamn thing!

194
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,971
The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

195
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:20,218
- Did you shoot the President?
- I didn't shoot anybody.

196
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:24,578
They have taken me in
because I have lived in the Soviet Union.

197
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,516
I'm just a patsy!

198
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,367
He sure looks like a creep.

199
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:35,092
I protested at that time I was not allowed
legal representation...

200
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,638
...during that very short and sweet hearing.

201
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,949
I really don't know...

202
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,903
...what this situation is about.

203
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:47,099
Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused...

204
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,491
...of murdering a policeman.

205
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,242
I know nothing more than that.

206
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:54,951
I do request someone to come forward...

207
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,642
...to give me legal assistance.

208
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,900
Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement
or whatever it's called?

209
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,394
It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

210
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,511
Why were you in Russia?
What happened to your eye?

211
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,505
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,394
A policeman hit me.

213
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,939
He gives me the willies.

214
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:16,047
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

215
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,566
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

216
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,660
A fine man.

217
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,312
After a stint in the Marines...

218
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,631
...he became fascinated by communism.
He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...

219
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:38,345
...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro
and ultra left-wing causes.

220
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:41,661
He spent last summer in New Orleans
and was arrested...

221
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,425
...in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.

222
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:50,799
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

223
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,501
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

224
00:15:56,378 --> 00:16:00,452
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

225
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:04,406
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

226
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:06,495
On Sunday?

227
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,152
Sunday. 11:00.

228
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:10,499
Thanks, Lou.

229
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,281
I would say that he is the killer...

230
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,138
...beyond a reasonable doubt
and to a moral certainty.

231
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:21,255
I thought a motorcycle had backfired.
I looked to my left.

232
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:23,644
A second shot hit him in the face.

233
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:28,612
The rifle, a cheap World War II,
Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...

234
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:31,299
...was ordered from
a Chicago mailing house...

235
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:34,533
...and shipped to Oswald's alias, A. Hidell...

236
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,800
...at a post office box in March of 1963.

237
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:41,521
This same rifle was used
to assassinate the President.

238
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,596
That ties it up.

239
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,935
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

240
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,652
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

241
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,143
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

242
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,681
I know David. Strange character.

243
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:03,446
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

244
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,411
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

245
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:10,488
These photos were found yesterday
among Oswald's possessions...

246
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,661
...in the garage where Marina Oswald
and her children are living.

247
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,665
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

248
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,049
He no shoot anyone.

249
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,831
He good man. Good husband.

250
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,462
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

251
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,275
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

252
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,319
Hold your horses.

253
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,063
What kind of source?

254
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,381
The anonymous kind, Chief.

255
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,401
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans' group...

256
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:46,562
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

257
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:51,608
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

258
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,052
Here he comes!

259
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,859
Anything to say in your defense?

260
00:18:02,621 --> 00:18:03,815
Oswald!

261
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,111
He shot him!

262
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,856
He shot him on TV!

263
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,819
There's a man with a gun!

264
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,317
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

265
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:26,502
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

266
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:35,293
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

267
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,930
It's wrong. This is crazy!

268
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,836
Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,
the business of government went on.

269
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:01,662
The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,
our Ambassador to Vietnam...

270
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,068
...and members of his Cabinet.

271
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,211
The major subject was Vietnam...

272
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:09,316
...a crisis that does not pause
for bereavement.

273
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:10,878
From this meeting...

274
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:15,058
...came affirmations that
the US would continue aiding...

275
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:19,593
...the new government of Vietnam in
its war against the Communist insurgents.

276
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,099
David Ferrie.

277
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:30,943
Come on in.

278
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:33,516
Thanks for coming.

279
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:37,816
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

280
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,381
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

281
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,433
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

282
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,860
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

283
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:53,547
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

284
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,356
Make yourself comfortable.

285
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,871
Mind if I smoke?

286
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:01,713
How could I?

287
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,051
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

288
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:09,429
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

289
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:12,777
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

290
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:16,576
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

291
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,825
...and that you knew Oswald.

292
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:23,618
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

293
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:27,315
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

294
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:30,250
If he did, I don't remember him.

295
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:32,856
Lots of boys in and out.

296
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:36,765
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

297
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,712
I never saw him before in my life.

298
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:45,990
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

299
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,515
Thanks for straightening it out.

300
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,644
There's one other matter.

301
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:59,098
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

302
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:01,742
True. I drove to Houston.

303
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:04,272
What was so appealing about Houston?

304
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:08,144
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

305
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,342
...decided to go skating.

306
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,980
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

307
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:16,412
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

308
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,101
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

309
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,945
Storm wasn't that bad.

310
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:26,535
Where did you drive?

311
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,801
We went to Houston.

312
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:31,328
Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.

313
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,252
And Sunday?

314
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,552
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

315
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,512
Did you bag any?

316
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,956
The boys got a couple.

317
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,077
Boys said they didn't get any.

318
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:47,857
They're right.

319
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:51,714
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

320
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:55,764
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

321
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,942
Your friends said you had no weapons.

322
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,797
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

323
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,182
I remember now. I'm sorry.

324
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,130
I got confused.

325
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:17,431
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

326
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:19,963
Stupid, right?

327
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,494
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

328
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,571
Thank you for your time.

329
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:29,943
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

330
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,431
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBI.

331
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:35,526
Why? What's wrong?

332
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,544
Your story is not believable.

333
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:40,697
Really?

334
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:45,365
What part?

335
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:08,433
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

336
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:10,473
...of New Orleans.

337
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,575
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

338
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:18,223
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

339
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,534
...or had any connection
with the assassination.

340
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,511
The agent in charge would like
to make clear...

341
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,557
...that Ferrie was brought in
for questioning...

342
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,479
...by the District Attorney
of Orleans Parish.

343
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:35,545
I thought we were on the same side.

344
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,436
Why are they saying that?

345
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,914
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

346
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:42,965
They must know something we don't.

347
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,184
So let's get on with our lives.

348
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,970
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

349
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:50,711
The President has announced...

350
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,252
...the creation of a commission
to probe the events in Dallas.

351
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:58,935
It will be headed
by Chief Justice Earl Warren...

352
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:04,225
...and is expected to head off
several Congressional and Texas inquiries.

353
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,750
On the panel are Allen Dulles,
ex-chief of the CIA...

354
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:11,610
...Representative Gerald Ford,
banker John McCloy...

355
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,042
Three Years Later

356
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,539
Fucking out of control.
All these hippies running around on drugs.

357
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:24,355
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

358
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:29,710
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

359
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,596
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child."

360
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:39,506
Johnson Seeks $9 Billion
In Extra Viet War Funds

361
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,257
It's a mess down there, Jim.

362
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:44,739
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

363
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:48,549
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

364
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:54,372
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

365
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:57,265
Don't get me started on that.

366
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:01,178
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

367
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:05,554
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

368
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:11,552
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

369
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,569
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

370
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:19,151
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

371
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:23,047
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

372
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:26,767
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

373
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:29,473
That means he wasn't any good.

374
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,514
Average man would be lucky
to shoot twice.

375
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:35,016
And the first would be the best.

376
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,628
Here the third shot's perfect.

377
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:40,840
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

378
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,165
...hitting Kennedy and Connally
seven times.

379
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,593
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

380
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,719
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

381
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:57,333
Think other men were involved?

382
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,711
If I was investigating the case, I'd round up
100 of the world's best riflemen...

383
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,874
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

384
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,427
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

385
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:12,935
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy!"
Believe it.

386
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:27,125
Dinner's just about ready.

387
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,070
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

388
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,206
- What?
- Dinner.

389
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,008
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

390
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,263
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

391
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:51,240
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

392
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:56,563
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

393
00:26:56,827 --> 00:27:01,026
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

394
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:04,476
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

395
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:06,549
What are you doing here?

396
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,077
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

397
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,746
Sure it is.

398
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:14,002
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

399
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,288
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

400
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,025
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

401
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:31,160
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

402
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,992
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

403
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,394
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

404
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,252
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

405
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,762
...not the Book Depository behind him.

406
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,537
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

407
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:51,893
I never believed it.

408
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,102
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

409
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,749
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

410
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,057
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

411
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:05,265
You keep digging it up.

412
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,731
You're the DA of New Orleans.

413
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:11,044
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

414
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:14,061
All those important people studied it.

415
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:18,191
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

416
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,629
Maybe you're right.

417
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:26,232
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

418
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,801
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

419
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,280
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

420
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,582
That's something. What is it?

421
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,513
It's a rhino in a cage.

422
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:45,932
- Can I stay up another hour?
- I don't think so, Son.

423
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:48,332
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

424
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:50,785
...dancing partners.

425
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:52,844
Good night, doodlebugs.

426
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:55,446
One hour, you hear?

427
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,300
Some Saturday-night date you are.

428
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:03,166
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

429
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:07,416
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

430
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:36,246
I sealed off the area and held off the trains
till they could be examined.

431
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:39,999
There were some transients taken on
at least one train.

432
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,976
Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us
about this matter. Is that correct?

433
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:48,437
Yes.

434
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:51,013
Is there anything else you told us...

435
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:54,349
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

436
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,378
Nothing that I can recall.

437
00:29:58,455 --> 00:29:59,968
Witness is excused.

438
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,185
A long freight was in there...

439
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,212
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

440
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:11,770
Do you mean some transients?

441
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,536
Tramps and hobos.

442
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:15,190
Were they questioned?

443
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:17,787
They were questioned at the station.

444
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,284
Ask the question.

445
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:23,743
Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.

446
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:28,945
Traffic had been cut off
into the area since 10:00.

447
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:32,548
But three cars came in during this time...

448
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:36,577
...from around noon till the time
of the shooting.

449
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,633
They circled the parking lot and left.

450
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:42,275
Like they was checking the area.

451
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,088
One of the drivers...

452
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:48,012
...was holding something up to his mouth.

453
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:55,475
The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.

454
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,508
It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.

455
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:02,275
Muddy up to the windows.

456
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,053
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

457
00:31:07,477 --> 00:31:09,991
...standing behind a picket fence...

458
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:14,682
...looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.

459
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,897
One of them was middle-aged...

460
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,341
...heavyset.

461
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,874
The other man was younger.

462
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:26,735
Two other men were on the east end
of the parking lot.

463
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:28,914
They both had uniforms.

464
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,534
At the time of the shooting...

465
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,803
...there seemed to be some commotion.

466
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,196
I'm just unable to describe...

467
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:43,717
...a flash of light or smoke or something...

468
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:47,879
...which caused me to feel that something
out of the ordinary...

469
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:50,009
...had occurred on the embankment.

470
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,381
Goddamn.

471
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:09,822
No!

472
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,474
- You all right?
- Honey, it's incredible.

473
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:19,499
What?

474
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,780
The whole thing.

475
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,628
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

476
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:28,561
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

477
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:32,034
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

478
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:34,068
A Russian exam.

479
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:38,954
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

480
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:43,587
In all my years in the military, I never knew
a single man who had a Russian test.

481
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,771
Oswald was a radar operator.

482
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,510
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

483
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,254
These books have gotten to your mind!

484
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:56,912
- Stop reading.
- He makes it sound like nothing.

485
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,207
Oswald did badly on his test.

486
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:02,738
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

487
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,684
That's like me saying,
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

488
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,277
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

489
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:14,768
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

490
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:18,665
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

491
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,927
Do I have to spell it out for you?

492
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,464
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

493
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,041
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

494
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,346
It was no accident he was in Russia.

495
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:34,998
- Go back to sleep.
- I've been sleeping for three years!

496
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:55,775
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

497
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,400
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

498
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:02,048
Old stains, but just as telling.

499
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:11,777
531 Lafayette Street.

500
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,758
Remember whose office this was in '63?

501
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,988
Sure. Guy Banister.

502
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:21,488
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

503
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,233
He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.

504
00:34:28,914 --> 00:34:32,305
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

505
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,958
To the right of Attila the Hun.

506
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:38,766
Recruited students to infiltrate
radical organizations on campus.

507
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:42,765
Headed the Anti-Communist League
of the Caribbean.

508
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,058
All out of this office.

509
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,393
I want to show you something.

510
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,255
Take a look here.

511
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:02,494
544 Camp Street.

512
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:05,535
531 Lafayette Street.

513
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,875
Same building, right?

514
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:12,240
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

515
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,545
...to the office upstairs.

516
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,721
Guess who used it?

517
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,651
Lee Harvey Oswald.

518
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,845
How do we know that?

519
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,093
This address was stamped on...

520
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:30,731
...pro-Castro leaflets he handed out
in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.

521
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,302
The same leaflets they found
in his garage in Dallas.

522
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:41,138
After the arrest, 544 Camp St.
Never appeared on the pamphlets again.

523
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,732
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

524
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:48,951
But he'd contacted them already...

525
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,550
...as an ex-Marine trying
to join their anti-Castro crusade.

526
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:57,528
When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.

527
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:01,012
What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!

528
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,932
Liar! Son of a bitch!

529
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,979
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

530
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,728
If you want to hit me, hit me.

531
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:11,317
You pinko shit!

532
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,075
Go back to Moscow!

533
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:15,195
There was no real fight.

534
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:19,102
The arresting Lieutenant later said
he felt it was a staged incident.

535
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:22,118
In jail, Oswald has a private session...

536
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,906
...with Special Agent John Quigley
of the FBI.

537
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:27,540
Oswald is released.

538
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,531
And Quigley destroys his notes
from the interview.

539
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:33,456
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

540
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,390
And he appears on a local TV debate.

541
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,919
You are a Communist, are you not?

542
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:43,868
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

543
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:48,159
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

544
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:54,092
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

545
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:56,947
I'd say he got intelligence training.

546
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:59,128
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

547
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,181
Office of Naval Intelligence.

548
00:37:01,806 --> 00:37:03,479
Look across the street.

549
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:05,549
Post Office.

550
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:09,659
Upstairs, in 1963,
that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.

551
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:13,890
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBI, was ONI.

552
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,123
What's their saying?

553
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:18,080
"Once ONI, always ONI."

554
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,844
He likes working near his old pals.

555
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,086
We are standing in the heart...

556
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:29,716
...of the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

557
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,402
That's the FBI.

558
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,786
That's the CIA.

559
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,845
That's the Secret Service.

560
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,073
That's the ONI.

561
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,522
Isn't this a strange place...

562
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,184
...for a Communist
to spend his spare time?

563
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,234
What are you driving at?

564
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,558
We're going back into the case.

565
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,075
The murder of the President.

566
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,461
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

567
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,020
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

568
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,801
Let's track down your anonymous source
from three years ago.

569
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,102
How'd you find out David Ferrie drove
to Texas that day?

570
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:09,845
I can't remember last night,
let alone three years ago, Boss.

571
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,705
You're not being cross-examined.

572
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:21,029
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

573
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,826
Don't tell me you don't remember.

574
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:28,650
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

575
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:31,413
Here's my problem.

576
00:38:32,015 --> 00:38:35,213
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

577
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:38,070
- Over ten years.
- And he never hit you before?

578
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:39,625
Never touched me.

579
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:42,385
Yet, on November 22, 1963...

580
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:44,842
...the day of the President's murder...

581
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:46,859
...the police report says...

582
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:50,575
...he pistol-whipped you
with a.357 Magnum.

583
00:38:51,492 --> 00:38:54,529
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

584
00:38:56,037 --> 00:39:00,031
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

585
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,728
There's more to it.

586
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,534
How much more?

587
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:09,652
I shouldn't talk about it.

588
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,918
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

589
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:15,515
You buy what you read in the papers.

590
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:18,799
- You have other information?
- I didn't say that!

591
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:24,139
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

592
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,034
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

593
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:37,625
You were the only one here!

594
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:39,423
The only one here!

595
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,361
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

596
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:50,921
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

597
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:55,325
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

598
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,634
I was never part of the operation.

599
00:39:58,805 --> 00:40:02,514
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

600
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,410
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

601
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,878
It was a nuthouse.

602
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,181
Cubans coming, going. And Christ,
they all looked the same to me.

603
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:18,498
You going to play with this rifle or pack it?

604
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:20,176
Dave Ferrie.

605
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:23,606
- You know about him?
- We know Dave. Was he there?

606
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:26,380
He practically lived there.

607
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:30,125
The whole thing was...

608
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,870
...all cloak-and-dagger stuff.

609
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:35,237
They called it "Operation Mongoose."

610
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:41,126
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

611
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,689
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

612
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,324
...from Dallas through New Orleans
to Miami.

613
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:49,427
We stockpiled arms, explosives.

614
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:53,091
In view of the intelligence community
in Lafayette Square?

615
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:57,513
Yes. Everybody knew everybody.
They were all part of the network.

616
00:40:58,026 --> 00:40:59,779
All worked for the CIA.

617
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:05,531
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

618
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:08,275
Everybody was running guns then.

619
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:12,245
Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,
Morgan City, you name it.

620
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:15,544
McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.

621
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:22,314
Where does Banister fit in?

622
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:25,223
He was running his camp
north of Lake Pontchartrain.

623
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:27,179
Ferrie did a lot of the training.

624
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:31,737
They had a shooting range
and tropical territory, like in Cuba.

625
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,789
Some Americans were trained there too.

626
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,808
Nazi types. Mercenaries.

627
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:40,938
That Ferrie, though,
Jesus, he was the craziest.

628
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:47,400
Late summer the party was over.
Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.

629
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,224
He told the FBI, "Shut up the camp.

630
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:54,052
"Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all."

631
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:57,784
The G-men were just going
through the motions.

632
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,745
Their hearts were still
with their old FBI buddy Banister.

633
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:05,699
Oswald?

634
00:42:10,468 --> 00:42:12,107
He was there too.

635
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,383
Sometimes meeting with Banister.

636
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,202
With the door shut.

637
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:26,686
Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.
But he was there, all right.

638
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:28,698
Anything more specific, Jack?

639
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,547
It's important.

640
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:36,831
One time, the secretary got upset.

641
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:40,267
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,
Oswald is down on Canal Street...

642
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:43,490
...handing out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro.

643
00:42:48,462 --> 00:42:50,931
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

644
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:55,276
Was anyone else involved at...

645
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,906
...Banister's level?

646
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,640
One guy. I don't know who.

647
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,403
Big. White hair.

648
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:06,632
I saw him in the office once.
He looked out of place.

649
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:09,019
You know, a society guy.

650
00:43:09,732 --> 00:43:12,486
Can't remember his name,
but Oswald was with him.

651
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:18,079
He had something to do with money,
because Banister never kissed ass...

652
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:20,121
...but he kissed his.

653
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,857
Clay something.

654
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,832
That was his name. Clay...

655
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:32,276
- Bertrand?
- Yeah.

656
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,615
- Clay Bertrand?
- I don't know.

657
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:37,129
- Maybe not.
- No, that's right.

658
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,335
I must go.

659
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:41,880
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

660
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,200
Was Kennedy discussed?

661
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:45,542
I don't know.

662
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,105
- The assassination?
- No.

663
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,585
- Not with me. I've got to go.
- Hold on.

664
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:53,330
- That's all I'll say.
- What's the problem?

665
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:59,685
Do I have to spell it out for you?

666
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:02,330
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

667
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:05,629
You are so naive.

668
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:20,129
- When'd you do business with Bertrand?
- Pipe the bimbo in red.

669
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:25,091
- Lawdy.
- She's not as cute as you.

670
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:30,391
- You should try a legitimate business.
- Why are you dancing on my head?

671
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:33,834
- We've been friends since law school.
- Because you're conning me.

672
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,370
- I read your testimony.
- Grain of salt.

673
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:40,402
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

674
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,768
...and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
- Right.

675
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:46,744
That's pretty important.

676
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:51,720
You told the FBI he's 6' 2".
Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".

677
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:54,637
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

678
00:44:55,164 --> 00:44:59,477
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

679
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,166
Truth is, I never met the dude.

680
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:05,978
- One likes friends that have friends.
- Indeed.

681
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:09,212
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

682
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:12,108
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

683
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:16,026
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

684
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,789
- You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?
- No.

685
00:45:18,978 --> 00:45:22,448
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

686
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:27,131
- I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
- Then how did you get in the Commission?

687
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:30,064
Like I told the Washington boys...

688
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:34,201
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

689
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,524
Mr. Bertrand said
he would take care of any of...

690
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:39,504
Fine.

691
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:43,502
- To whom am I speaking?
- Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.

692
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:48,113
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

693
00:45:48,547 --> 00:45:50,265
He was his brother.

694
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:53,559
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

695
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:58,022
- It was Oswald. He hated...
- We're having a communication problem.

696
00:45:58,264 --> 00:46:02,817
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

697
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,585
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

698
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,195
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

699
00:46:12,611 --> 00:46:15,080
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

700
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,078
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

701
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:21,676
Off the record?

702
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:26,021
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

703
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:33,188
If I answer that question you keep asking...

704
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:36,968
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

705
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,497
...then it's bon voyage, Deano.

706
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:43,042
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

707
00:46:43,348 --> 00:46:46,978
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

708
00:46:47,644 --> 00:46:50,204
The government's still breathing.

709
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:53,809
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

710
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:56,698
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

711
00:46:57,152 --> 00:47:00,350
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

712
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:03,220
Do you know what you're getting into?

713
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:08,027
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

714
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,426
Good day to you, sir.

715
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,832
District Attorney Garrison
to see Prisoner 5388.

716
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,015
Ward block 237B.

717
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,970
We don't need gates with that swamp.

718
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,989
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

719
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,654
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

720
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,255
- How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
- Let's go, Willie.

721
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,750
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

722
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:19,191
I got nothing but time.

723
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,258
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

724
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:26,968
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

725
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,890
Clay Bertrand?

726
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,817
I met him sometime in...

727
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:38,005
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

728
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,333
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

729
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,320
Sexual purposes?

730
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:46,030
Did he pay you?

731
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,777
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

732
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,521
Anything unusual about him...

733
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:53,906
...you'd be able to describe in court?

734
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:57,246
He had something wrong with his leg,
a limp.

735
00:48:57,514 --> 00:49:00,313
Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.

736
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,430
He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.

737
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:08,125
You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.

738
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:11,089
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

739
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:14,163
...sometime late in the summer of '63.

740
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,584
There was about nine to ten people there.

741
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:23,105
Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.

742
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,378
Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice...

743
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,347
...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.

744
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:33,632
Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.

745
00:49:34,298 --> 00:49:38,531
Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.

746
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:43,135
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

747
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,749
That's where you first met Oswald?

748
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,866
Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

749
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:50,290
Leon Oswald.

750
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:51,963
How you doing?

751
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,939
What the fuck is he doing here?

752
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,748
Fuck you, motherfucker.

753
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:01,787
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

754
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,093
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

755
00:50:05,328 --> 00:50:07,923
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

756
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:09,934
I'm already in jail.

757
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,178
Go on.

758
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,936
Finally they left
and I was alone with Dave...

759
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:16,729
...and this Leon...

760
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:19,390
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

761
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:22,795
Dave pulled out some clippings.

762
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:26,041
He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.

763
00:50:27,515 --> 00:50:30,986
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

764
00:50:31,268 --> 00:50:35,148
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

765
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:36,716
All our weapons!

766
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:41,081
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

767
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:44,271
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

768
00:50:44,614 --> 00:50:47,448
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

769
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,410
They got new stuff!

770
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:54,090
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

771
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,575
No trace!

772
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:59,543
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...

773
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:05,438
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

774
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:07,571
Licking his ass.

775
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:13,563
An inspired act of God should happen here
and put a Texan in the White House!

776
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:18,559
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

777
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:21,770
He started in on Kennedy again.

778
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:25,267
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

779
00:51:26,027 --> 00:51:27,905
Somebody must get rid of him!

780
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:31,560
You won't get that son of a bitch!

781
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:35,102
It won't be long.
That fucker will get what he deserves.

782
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,604
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

783
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:41,107
We just need to get him in the open.

784
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,565
Always some harebrained scheme.

785
00:51:48,048 --> 00:51:50,961
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

786
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,610
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

787
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:57,615
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

788
00:51:58,015 --> 00:51:59,927
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

789
00:52:00,101 --> 00:52:03,060
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

790
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,955
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

791
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:09,955
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

792
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:13,614
A diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one way.

793
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,494
Boom! Get the kill shot.

794
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:18,566
One man has to be sacrificed.

795
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:21,978
In the commotion, the job gets done.

796
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,082
The others leave the country.

797
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:28,986
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

798
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:32,971
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

799
00:52:34,257 --> 00:52:37,375
I didn't think much about it then.
It's just bullshit.

800
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:40,267
People like to act more important
than they are.

801
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:42,470
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

802
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:45,780
But when they got him...

803
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,744
...I got scared.

804
00:52:48,062 --> 00:52:49,415
Real scared.

805
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:51,301
That's when I got popped.

806
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,557
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

807
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:59,549
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

808
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:01,776
No one can buy me.

809
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,261
- I don't even need this parole.
- What parole?

810
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:10,258
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

811
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:14,459
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

812
00:53:15,004 --> 00:53:17,234
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

813
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:21,253
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

814
00:53:23,346 --> 00:53:27,659
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

815
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,503
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

816
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:33,405
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

817
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:37,318
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

818
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:41,607
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

819
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:44,674
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

820
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,824
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

821
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,712
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

822
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,909
A great day for this country.

823
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:58,728
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

824
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:01,370
Didn't know shit, anyway.

825
00:54:01,714 --> 00:54:04,991
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

826
00:54:05,885 --> 00:54:08,400
Because he was a Communist.

827
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:13,583
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

828
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,610
Don't matter to me!

829
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,299
All right, Willie. Thanks.

830
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,839
We'll be in touch.

831
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,219
All right.

832
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:30,970
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

833
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,928
Not bad at all.

834
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:36,494
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

835
00:54:37,164 --> 00:54:39,360
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

836
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,500
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

837
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:44,607
That bothers you?

838
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:50,336
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

839
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:54,764
Find Clay Bertrand.
Start by checking around the Quarter.

840
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:57,725
The six of us,
with almost no budget and in secret...

841
00:54:57,932 --> 00:55:00,493
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

842
00:55:00,686 --> 00:55:04,396
- I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
- Thanks, Boss.

843
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:08,520
You're a fighter.
I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.

844
00:55:09,068 --> 00:55:11,708
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

845
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:13,341
You vote for me?

846
00:55:13,489 --> 00:55:16,766
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

847
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:18,266
We sang:

848
00:55:18,452 --> 00:55:21,365
"You're the cream in my coffee"

849
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:25,751
Haven't seen you much lately.

850
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:29,953
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

851
00:55:30,254 --> 00:55:33,452
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

852
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:37,698
How are you? Nice to see you.

853
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:40,360
Welcome back, Lou.

854
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:45,410
- Think I could get a martini?
- They're waiting for you, sir.

855
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:48,887
Keep that table open for us.

856
00:55:51,942 --> 00:55:53,694
Anything on the hoboes?

857
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:57,345
Dallas Times Herald photographer
got great shots.

858
00:55:58,197 --> 00:55:59,711
Never published.

859
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,378
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

860
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:09,801
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

861
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:13,948
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

862
00:56:14,964 --> 00:56:16,716
These two look young.

863
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:21,081
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

864
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:24,859
...clean hands, new shoe leather.
- Who the hell are they then?

865
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,674
Sit down.

866
00:56:32,271 --> 00:56:34,831
This could be it. Let's look for them.

867
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:40,322
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

868
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:43,498
Graveyard. Dead. August this year.

869
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:47,673
Single-car accident on an empty road
in Midlothian, Texas.

870
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:51,116
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

871
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:53,700
We need to find more witnesses.

872
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:56,267
There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.

873
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:59,426
She said she was a dope runner
for Jack Ruby.

874
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:03,400
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

875
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,940
- Can we talk to her?
- She's dead too.

876
00:57:07,638 --> 00:57:08,912
Hit and run.

877
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,336
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

878
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:21,490
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

879
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:25,769
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

880
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,156
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

881
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,420
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

882
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:36,639
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

883
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:41,925
I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.

884
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:47,578
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

885
00:57:47,883 --> 00:57:51,194
All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.

886
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,794
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

887
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,149
Lonely kid, no father.

888
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,641
Joins the Marines at 17.

889
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:03,827
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

890
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,126
But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan...

891
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,159
...where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.

892
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:13,385
He's discharged...

893
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:17,048
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

894
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:21,962
Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.

895
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,254
Mr. Oswald, do you understand...

896
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,410
...the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

897
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:33,035
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

898
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:36,232
...and become a Soviet citizen.

899
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:40,858
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

900
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:44,516
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

901
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:47,956
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

902
00:58:48,147 --> 00:58:51,345
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

903
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,246
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

904
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:58,616
Has affairs with local girls.

905
00:58:58,866 --> 00:59:00,778
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

906
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,631
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

907
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:08,390
He meets Marina.

908
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:11,910
Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.

909
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:15,992
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

910
00:59:16,174 --> 00:59:19,008
Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.

911
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:23,462
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

912
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,205
Or fake secrets.

913
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:27,386
Six months after he's in Russia...

914
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,870
...Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down...

915
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:33,739
...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.

916
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:35,707
Powers hinted that Oswald...

917
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:38,737
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

918
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:43,303
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

919
00:59:43,574 --> 00:59:47,614
Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?

920
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:51,310
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

921
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,853
- Stick to what you can prove in court.
- You want facts?

922
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,107
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

923
01:00:01,216 --> 01:00:03,572
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

924
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,356
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

925
01:00:07,596 --> 01:00:09,507
...and loans him travel money.

926
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:15,060
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

927
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:18,157
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

928
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:22,236
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

929
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,484
Did Marina have problems getting out?

930
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:29,808
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

931
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:35,302
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

932
01:00:35,748 --> 01:00:38,946
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

933
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,362
Doesn't add up.

934
01:00:40,502 --> 01:00:43,779
Next thing, he's living in Dallas-Fort Worth,
October '62...

935
01:00:44,297 --> 01:00:47,176
...working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...

936
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:50,735
...a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.

937
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:55,415
Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.

938
01:00:55,642 --> 01:00:57,314
All rabid anti-Communists.

939
01:00:57,935 --> 01:00:58,845
It's odd.

940
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:04,178
His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

941
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:09,716
He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.

942
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:15,578
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages...

943
01:01:15,868 --> 01:01:18,666
...and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war...

944
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,022
...also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

945
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:28,105
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual...

946
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:32,412
...well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.

947
01:01:36,304 --> 01:01:39,217
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

948
01:01:40,057 --> 01:01:44,097
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion...

949
01:01:44,353 --> 01:01:47,585
...I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

950
01:01:47,982 --> 01:01:50,542
That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.

951
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:54,410
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission...

952
01:01:54,653 --> 01:01:57,566
...as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

953
01:01:57,949 --> 01:02:01,181
Well, in that sense
Castro is an experimenter.

954
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:05,559
It could go any way with that country.

955
01:02:05,831 --> 01:02:09,063
- It could go the way of the communism...
- What you got there?

956
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,338
Do you have rifles in there?

957
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:19,055
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

958
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:22,745
- I hunt.
- You hunt?

959
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:26,317
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

960
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:28,190
Call him Oswald's handler.

961
01:02:28,686 --> 01:02:32,885
The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.

962
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:39,592
It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job...

963
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:43,182
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

964
01:02:44,284 --> 01:02:48,836
So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

965
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:54,029
Marina fights with Lee about many things.

966
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:58,775
His secrecy, their lack of money.

967
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:02,677
She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.

968
01:03:05,553 --> 01:03:07,624
Lee hits her on several occasions.

969
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:10,164
At the age of 24...

970
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:13,585
...he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.

971
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:16,937
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

972
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:19,738
No, thank you. I'm fine.

973
01:03:20,943 --> 01:03:24,653
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

974
01:03:24,988 --> 01:03:28,345
Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family...

975
01:03:28,742 --> 01:03:31,303
...and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.

976
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,853
Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house...

977
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:39,048
...where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.

978
01:03:39,252 --> 01:03:42,130
There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.

979
01:03:43,506 --> 01:03:46,020
I have to go away. Just for a short while.

980
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:49,046
What's wrong with this family?

981
01:03:49,386 --> 01:03:50,580
I love Lee...

982
01:03:51,013 --> 01:03:53,049
...and I sorry him.

983
01:03:53,723 --> 01:03:54,872
Sorry for him?

984
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:56,616
Yes.

985
01:03:56,727 --> 01:03:59,561
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

986
01:03:59,771 --> 01:04:02,922
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

987
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,124
I have too much facts...

988
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:09,065
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

989
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,811
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

990
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:15,111
...and afraid she'd be deported...

991
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:18,527
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

992
01:04:19,081 --> 01:04:20,992
They taught her how to answer.

993
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,086
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

994
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:26,649
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

995
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:30,308
- I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
- Oswald was no angel.

996
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:33,161
But who was he?

997
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,741
I'm lost. What are we saying?

998
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:40,409
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

999
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:45,948
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

1000
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:49,788
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

1001
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:53,318
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

1002
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:56,969
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

1003
01:04:57,157 --> 01:04:58,875
...didn't pull the trigger.

1004
01:04:59,035 --> 01:05:02,550
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

1005
01:05:02,787 --> 01:05:06,303
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

1006
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:10,318
- His palm print was on it.
- It went to the FBI.

1007
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:13,120
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

1008
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:18,027
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

1009
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:22,765
It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.

1010
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:27,295
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

1011
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:30,871
...to a P.O. Box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

1012
01:05:31,731 --> 01:05:35,042
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1013
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,634
To frame him, obviously!

1014
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:38,894
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1015
01:05:39,156 --> 01:05:41,067
We're talking about our government!

1016
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,391
We're talking about a crime.

1017
01:05:44,243 --> 01:05:47,281
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1018
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:50,108
We're through the looking glass.

1019
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:52,437
White is black.

1020
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:54,851
And black is white.

1021
01:05:55,963 --> 01:05:58,477
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1022
01:05:59,424 --> 01:06:00,459
A patsy.

1023
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:08,550
Unbelievable. You were here?

1024
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:10,916
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1025
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,836
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

1026
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:17,911
...near the overpass.

1027
01:06:18,316 --> 01:06:21,946
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1028
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:24,808
I made it clear to the Warren people.

1029
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:27,902
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1030
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:32,611
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1031
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,832
Out from under those trees.

1032
01:06:35,082 --> 01:06:38,279
All four of us railroad men...

1033
01:06:38,502 --> 01:06:40,141
...seen the same thing.

1034
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:42,793
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1035
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,004
I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1036
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,246
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1037
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,949
"Mr. President, look over here!"

1038
01:06:57,102 --> 01:06:58,581
Then shots rang out.

1039
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:05,643
Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,
"They're shooting! Get down!"

1040
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:08,902
I just stood there watching.

1041
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:11,462
The driver had stopped.

1042
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,281
I don't know what was wrong with him.

1043
01:07:16,996 --> 01:07:18,907
Out of the corner of my eye...

1044
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:21,823
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1045
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,106
And that last shot...

1046
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,975
...just ripped his head off.

1047
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:32,170
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1048
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:34,744
We came around to look for tracks.

1049
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:38,391
It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.

1050
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:40,374
Cigarette butts.

1051
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:42,827
Someone had stood about... here.

1052
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:50,750
That's a good spot.

1053
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:53,017
For the head shot.

1054
01:07:54,948 --> 01:07:56,746
Everything was just frozen.

1055
01:07:57,784 --> 01:08:01,744
Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.

1056
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:06,432
Except for one man.

1057
01:08:07,502 --> 01:08:11,655
I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository...

1058
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:13,276
...to the parking lot.

1059
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,301
It was about 11:00 a.m.

1060
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,272
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1061
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,492
A light-blue Valiant.

1062
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,463
I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic...

1063
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,405
...and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.

1064
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,852
It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.

1065
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,195
When I saw the gun, I thought...

1066
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,886
..."The Secret Service is not very secret."

1067
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,747
The next morning, I went to the FBI office.

1068
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:44,988
They showed me some pictures.

1069
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,963
And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.

1070
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:51,399
That's the man.

1071
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:54,056
You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?

1072
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,331
That's right.

1073
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:57,055
The day before he shot Oswald?

1074
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:00,658
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1075
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:04,324
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck."

1076
01:09:05,972 --> 01:09:08,612
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1077
01:09:09,226 --> 01:09:12,105
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1078
01:09:13,396 --> 01:09:16,434
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1079
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:19,206
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1080
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:24,268
I thought maybe our guys had shot back
and got one of them.

1081
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:27,164
I got to the parking lot.

1082
01:09:28,035 --> 01:09:31,108
All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.

1083
01:09:32,956 --> 01:09:37,030
- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

1084
01:09:37,794 --> 01:09:39,228
I want your pictures.

1085
01:09:39,378 --> 01:09:40,527
Son of a bitch!

1086
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,582
He put a hurt on me, but good.

1087
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:47,441
They must've seen everything because
they knew what we had done all day.

1088
01:09:48,345 --> 01:09:51,224
I wasn't hard to find,
wearing that red raincoat.

1089
01:09:51,432 --> 01:09:54,265
- How many shots did you hear?
- Four to six.

1090
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,675
Impossible!

1091
01:09:57,812 --> 01:09:59,292
You heard echoes!

1092
01:10:01,691 --> 01:10:05,162
We have three bullets and three shots
that came from the Book Depository.

1093
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,678
- That's all we'll say.
- No, sir.

1094
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:13,000
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1095
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:16,578
- You go out there and get him!
- That's taken care of!

1096
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:20,263
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1097
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:22,483
No one. Understand?

1098
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:26,268
Which is strange 'cause it's less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.

1099
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:27,859
Get her out of here.

1100
01:10:28,008 --> 01:10:30,363
I knew something was crooked
as a dog's hind leg.

1101
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:34,961
When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report...

1102
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,630
...it was a total fabrication.

1103
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:41,896
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1104
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:44,667
This one says:

1105
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:49,415
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed...

1106
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:52,846
"...slouched over the wheel
of the green truck." Not true.

1107
01:10:53,072 --> 01:10:55,587
I recognized him and I told them so.

1108
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:57,975
Take your time.

1109
01:10:58,202 --> 01:10:58,998
I'm sure.

1110
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,951
And the sheriff's report...

1111
01:11:01,455 --> 01:11:02,888
This is really strange.

1112
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:05,327
See that notarized signature?

1113
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:07,984
That's not mine.

1114
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:11,171
There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1115
01:11:13,466 --> 01:11:15,583
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...

1116
01:11:17,762 --> 01:11:19,833
...it's difficult to accept this.

1117
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:23,394
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison
about the Carousel Club.

1118
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:33,604
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1119
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,803
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1120
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:38,216
Everybody came.

1121
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:41,972
Businessmen, politicians from Austin,
LBJ's friends...

1122
01:11:42,618 --> 01:11:44,689
Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.

1123
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:48,425
You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,
spit, dated policemen.

1124
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:52,235
But Jack was exciting.
There were always cops there.

1125
01:11:52,461 --> 01:11:56,137
Jack liked them around, even though
he threw out the drunks himself.

1126
01:11:56,965 --> 01:11:58,603
He had a violent temper.

1127
01:11:59,926 --> 01:12:02,759
Everyone in those days
knew Jack was in the mob.

1128
01:12:03,972 --> 01:12:06,440
Cops back then, they were bad.

1129
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:09,936
They'd shake you down
for the money in your pocket.

1130
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:13,545
What about Lee?

1131
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:16,256
One time I came in.

1132
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,632
Jack introduced me to two guys.
He says, "This is my friend, Lee..."

1133
01:12:23,156 --> 01:12:25,386
I don't remember the other guy's name.

1134
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:29,330
He was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1135
01:12:30,037 --> 01:12:31,915
And he looked like a buzzard.

1136
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,817
Lee didn't make much of an impression.

1137
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:40,001
He wasn't very handsome.

1138
01:12:40,297 --> 01:12:43,688
He didn't look like he had any money,
and he was in a bad mood.

1139
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,048
So, I didn't pay him much mind.

1140
01:12:48,055 --> 01:12:51,128
I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

1141
01:12:53,017 --> 01:12:55,293
Later, when I saw him on television...

1142
01:12:56,812 --> 01:12:58,962
...I screamed, "My God, that's him!

1143
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:01,329
"That's Jack's friend!"

1144
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:04,745
Will you testify, Beverly?

1145
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:10,068
- I don't think so.
- I thought we had an agreement.

1146
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:17,909
- I don't want to be another statistic.
- We could call you in.

1147
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,977
If they can kill the President
of the United States...

1148
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:27,267
...you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

1149
01:13:33,513 --> 01:13:35,823
I understand the pressure you're under.

1150
01:13:36,724 --> 01:13:38,396
Don't think that I don't.

1151
01:13:39,686 --> 01:13:41,039
We both do.

1152
01:13:47,066 --> 01:13:52,142
Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand
that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

1153
01:13:53,657 --> 01:13:56,889
There are people here who do not want me
to tell the truth.

1154
01:13:57,202 --> 01:13:59,353
Who don't want me to have a retrial.

1155
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:01,988
Why don't you just tell us now?

1156
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,216
My life is in danger!

1157
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:07,052
If you request that I go to Washington...

1158
01:14:07,253 --> 01:14:10,290
That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

1159
01:14:10,672 --> 01:14:12,152
Can you take me with you?

1160
01:14:12,299 --> 01:14:14,051
No. It can't be done.

1161
01:14:14,676 --> 01:14:16,668
There would be no safe place for you.

1162
01:14:16,845 --> 01:14:19,314
We're not law-enforcement officers.

1163
01:14:20,348 --> 01:14:23,341
There's a great deal at stake in this matter.

1164
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:26,438
If I'm eliminated...

1165
01:14:26,854 --> 01:14:31,168
...there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1166
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:36,782
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

1167
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,869
And I won't live to see you
some other time.

1168
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:44,292
I want to tell the truth.

1169
01:14:44,455 --> 01:14:45,570
And then...

1170
01:14:45,788 --> 01:14:47,381
...leave this world.

1171
01:14:49,709 --> 01:14:53,066
The Zapruder film establishes
three shots in 5.6 seconds.

1172
01:14:56,674 --> 01:14:57,948
I'm Oswald.

1173
01:14:59,093 --> 01:15:00,322
Time me.

1174
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,505
Go.

1175
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:08,768
Time?

1176
01:15:09,019 --> 01:15:10,611
Between six and seven seconds.

1177
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,124
Without really aiming.

1178
01:15:12,272 --> 01:15:15,868
The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1179
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:18,770
It takes a minimum of...

1180
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:21,376
...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1181
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:24,345
The other problem is, there was a tree...

1182
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:28,493
...blocking the first two shots
when fired in the Zapruder film.

1183
01:15:29,329 --> 01:15:32,845
Didn't Hoover say something
about leaves falling in November?

1184
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,492
It was Texas live oak, Chief.

1185
01:15:36,169 --> 01:15:38,444
It sheds its leaves in early March.

1186
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,407
Take this Carcano,
world's worst shoulder weapon...

1187
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:47,037
...and try to hit a moving target
at 88 yards through heavy foliage.

1188
01:15:47,888 --> 01:15:48,957
No way.

1189
01:15:52,059 --> 01:15:54,209
FBI tried two sets of tests.

1190
01:15:54,436 --> 01:15:57,474
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1191
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,209
Not one.

1192
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:01,788
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1193
01:16:02,443 --> 01:16:04,514
The scope was defective on it too.

1194
01:16:05,112 --> 01:16:07,673
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1195
01:16:08,283 --> 01:16:10,672
The guy couldn't do the shooting.

1196
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:12,518
Nobody could.

1197
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:15,427
They sold this lemon
to the American public.

1198
01:16:17,374 --> 01:16:20,333
The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

1199
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,015
We must get hold of it.

1200
01:16:24,465 --> 01:16:27,299
It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.

1201
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:30,473
Let me ask you something.

1202
01:16:30,844 --> 01:16:33,120
Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1203
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:35,110
Plenty of time.

1204
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:39,396
- He's out in the open.
- I keep asking myself the same thing.

1205
01:16:39,604 --> 01:16:41,913
- Frontal shot.
- Even if you miss him once...

1206
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,381
...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1207
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,522
The only reason to get him on Elm...

1208
01:16:47,277 --> 01:16:50,110
...is you got him in a triangulated crossfire.

1209
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:53,792
You put a team there down at the fence.

1210
01:16:54,116 --> 01:16:56,631
Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

1211
01:16:57,327 --> 01:17:00,604
Put a third team down in this building...

1212
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:02,059
...on a low floor.

1213
01:17:02,207 --> 01:17:05,280
When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

1214
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:09,616
How many men?

1215
01:17:11,341 --> 01:17:15,050
One shooter. One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.

1216
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,798
These are professional riflemen.
Serious people.

1217
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:23,259
Hunters.

1218
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:26,373
Patient.

1219
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:30,548
It takes skill to kill with a rifle.

1220
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:38,251
That's why no chief executive's
been executed with one in 200 years.

1221
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:43,108
Three...

1222
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,157
...two...

1223
01:17:46,707 --> 01:17:47,663
...one.

1224
01:17:57,509 --> 01:17:59,421
Main Street's over there.

1225
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:02,939
Original parade route on the way
to the Trade Mart...

1226
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,209
...is too far, right?

1227
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,419
Too far.

1228
01:18:06,558 --> 01:18:10,347
Impossible shot,
so they change the parade route.

1229
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:13,650
Bring him down here.
Moving at a normal 25 mph.

1230
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:17,009
They knew the motorcade would have
to slow down to about 10 mph...

1231
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:20,229
...to make that turn there.
And that's where they got him.

1232
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:30,263
Who do you think changed
the parade route?

1233
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:33,334
Beats me. Secret Service,
city officials, Dallas Police.

1234
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,205
You know who was the mayor at the time?

1235
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,494
Roy Cabell.

1236
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,959
- Guess who his brother is?
- Who?

1237
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,563
General Charles Cabell.

1238
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,895
Deputy director of the CIA.

1239
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:48,092
Kennedy fired him in '61
because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

1240
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:52,386
Moved back to the Pentagon
and called Kennedy a traitor.

1241
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,529
When he came to New Orleans...

1242
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:58,567
...to address the Foreign Policy
Association, know who introduced him?

1243
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:00,955
Our friend, Clay Shaw.

1244
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:02,827
Didn't the Warren Commission call him?

1245
01:19:02,986 --> 01:19:05,217
His boss was the one
on the Warren Commission...

1246
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:07,556
...who handled the leads
in the intelligence community.

1247
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:10,494
- Allen Dulles?
- Head of the CIA since '53.

1248
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:13,539
Kennedy fired them both.

1249
01:19:14,747 --> 01:19:17,216
Cabell was his Deputy for nine years.

1250
01:19:18,668 --> 01:19:21,467
Talk about the fox investigating
the chicken coop.

1251
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,645
Now, we'll have to subpoena them both.

1252
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:40,451
Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.

1253
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,209
Comes to the Quarter.

1254
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,195
Who is he? I've been to all the bars.
Nobody wants to talk.

1255
01:19:47,737 --> 01:19:49,568
Why should they talk to you?

1256
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:54,494
I told your uncle, I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.

1257
01:19:58,747 --> 01:20:01,706
A big-shot businessman.
I seen him on the TV news...

1258
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,908
...with all the other big shots.

1259
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:06,338
The guy's a fag, you know?

1260
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:08,393
Goes by another name.

1261
01:20:08,756 --> 01:20:10,075
What name?

1262
01:20:10,966 --> 01:20:11,956
Shaw.

1263
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:13,412
Clay Shaw.

1264
01:20:13,802 --> 01:20:15,555
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?

1265
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:18,864
Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?

1266
01:20:19,475 --> 01:20:22,672
What's the mystery?
Everybody down here knows him.

1267
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:26,334
Then why does he call himself Bertrand?

1268
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:29,083
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?

1269
01:20:29,567 --> 01:20:33,083
Will you give us a little help
on that grand jury thing?

1270
01:20:34,154 --> 01:20:35,747
I hope so. We could use it.

1271
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,992
Your hunch was right, Boss.

1272
01:20:38,241 --> 01:20:40,153
But it's even spookier than we thought.

1273
01:20:40,327 --> 01:20:44,844
Starting in September '63 on,
two months before the assassination...

1274
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,328
...there are sightings of Oswald
all over Dallas.

1275
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:53,015
Buying ammunition,
getting a telescopic sight fixed.

1276
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,076
Going to rifle ranges.

1277
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:59,129
Early November,
at a downtown Dallas Lincoln dealership...

1278
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,743
...he tells the salesman:
- Let's take it over for a test drive.

1279
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:06,807
Despite the fact he has no license,
and doesn't know how to drive...

1280
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:10,386
...he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt
at the Indy 500.

1281
01:21:10,689 --> 01:21:13,807
Beauregard later told his boss
that he drove like a madman.

1282
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:17,738
$300 down now, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive out of here.

1283
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:19,979
What? For this heap?

1284
01:21:21,032 --> 01:21:24,912
No honest working man can afford to buy
a car in this goddamn country anymore.

1285
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:27,312
Maybe I'll go to Russia and buy one.

1286
01:21:27,538 --> 01:21:31,213
Really dumb dialogue like he's trying
to draw attention to himself.

1287
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:38,228
Salesman remembers him as about 5' 7",
but his draft card says he's actually 5' 11 ".

1288
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:42,683
Other witnesses see him on several
separate days at different firing ranges.

1289
01:21:43,344 --> 01:21:45,255
One time, November 9...

1290
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:48,748
...he decides to practice
on the next guy's target.

1291
01:21:48,975 --> 01:21:52,730
I didn't pay for a target
just to have you shoot at it!

1292
01:21:54,062 --> 01:21:56,213
I'm sorry, buddy.

1293
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,467
I thought I was shooting
at that son of a bitch Kennedy.

1294
01:22:00,902 --> 01:22:03,895
As subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

1295
01:22:04,155 --> 01:22:06,510
Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...

1296
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:10,461
...a Cuban lady in Dallas
in the anti-Castro underground.

1297
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:13,623
The two Cubans introduce him
as Leon Oswald.

1298
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:18,164
Something about the man bothers her.

1299
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:21,055
48 hours later, one of the Cubans calls her.

1300
01:22:21,839 --> 01:22:23,990
What did you think of me
and Oswald last night?

1301
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:25,573
I don't care about Oswald.

1302
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:29,074
You know what he said to us?
"Cubans don't have guts, 'cause Kennedy...

1303
01:22:29,304 --> 01:22:32,377
"...should have been killed
after the Bay of Pigs by a Cuban."

1304
01:22:32,598 --> 01:22:35,989
It's like he's giving her information
she doesn't even ask for.

1305
01:22:36,227 --> 01:22:38,377
She's scared and doesn't see him again...

1306
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,441
...till she sees Oswald's picture
in the paper.

1307
01:22:41,815 --> 01:22:43,966
But the Warren Commission
says that Sylvia...

1308
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:47,747
...has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico...

1309
01:22:48,322 --> 01:22:50,631
...trying to get back into Cuba.

1310
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,237
The CIA has a camera
outside the Cuban Embassy.

1311
01:22:54,618 --> 01:22:56,291
And they say that this...

1312
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,284
...is Oswald in Mexico.

1313
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,871
If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1314
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:08,539
The Warren Commission made great efforts
to make him a Communist.

1315
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:13,646
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1316
01:23:15,347 --> 01:23:17,702
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald...

1317
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:21,566
...had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President...

1318
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:25,766
...the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1319
01:23:25,982 --> 01:23:28,816
I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1320
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:32,364
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1321
01:23:32,737 --> 01:23:36,174
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1322
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:37,886
This is not me!

1323
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:41,714
- That came from Janet Williams' garage.
- I never saw this picture.

1324
01:23:41,954 --> 01:23:46,506
It's my face but it's superimposed.
The rest is not me.

1325
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:49,865
I know photographic work.
That picture was made by someone else!

1326
01:23:50,504 --> 01:23:52,575
I took this picture to two experts.

1327
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,650
Look at how the shadows on the nose...

1328
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:58,406
...fall in a straight line, like it's high noon.

1329
01:23:58,594 --> 01:24:02,110
But the shadow on the ground is more
like late afternoon or early morning.

1330
01:24:02,348 --> 01:24:03,782
It's not the same time.

1331
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:06,208
And see the crop marks across the chin?

1332
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:09,118
This head is pasted onto another body.

1333
01:24:09,564 --> 01:24:11,999
Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.

1334
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:15,264
Who the hell are you?
Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?

1335
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,950
You're the policeman, you work it out.

1336
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:23,677
Now it gets positively spooky.

1337
01:24:24,077 --> 01:24:28,469
In January 1961, in New Orleans,
at the Bolton Ford dealership...

1338
01:24:29,248 --> 01:24:31,717
...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...

1339
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:35,733
...there is a man using the name of Oswald
to buy trucks...

1340
01:24:36,005 --> 01:24:37,882
...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.

1341
01:24:38,048 --> 01:24:39,880
Salesman never sees him again.

1342
01:24:40,051 --> 01:24:44,364
But who's on the Articles Of Incorporation
of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?

1343
01:24:45,555 --> 01:24:46,749
Guy Banister.

1344
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:51,065
Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

1345
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:55,536
Hoover at the FBI has a memo
dated June of 1960...

1346
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,870
...that someone may be using
Oswald's passport and identity.

1347
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:02,712
They created Oswald from day one.

1348
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:06,909
Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.
Just move him around a board.

1349
01:25:07,618 --> 01:25:09,210
Anybody want to quit?

1350
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:14,223
Dumb question. Put your hands down.

1351
01:25:16,043 --> 01:25:17,681
I found Clay Bertrand.

1352
01:25:18,878 --> 01:25:20,915
Grab your socks and hose and pull.

1353
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,216
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.

1354
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:27,331
- Director of the Trade Mart?
- Former director.

1355
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:28,794
Incredible.

1356
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:31,249
Can you get some sworn statements?

1357
01:25:31,598 --> 01:25:34,066
That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.

1358
01:25:35,018 --> 01:25:37,249
Let's have him in for a chat.

1359
01:25:37,771 --> 01:25:39,683
I hate to get him dragged into this.

1360
01:25:39,857 --> 01:25:43,167
He's done so much for the city,
restoring the Quarter.

1361
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:47,406
Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.
Seems like such a nice man.

1362
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:51,376
It'll be off the record.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.

1363
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:55,720
A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

1364
01:26:12,511 --> 01:26:14,183
In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...

1365
01:26:14,346 --> 01:26:17,464
...seven more American soldiers died
and 23 wounded.

1366
01:26:17,725 --> 01:26:20,559
The body count for this week
now stands at 67 Americans...

1367
01:26:20,769 --> 01:26:23,489
...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.

1368
01:26:24,356 --> 01:26:28,270
President Johnson said he regretted
there's no end in sight to the war...

1369
01:26:28,985 --> 01:26:31,500
...where 500,000 US troops
are now fighting.

1370
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:33,217
We face more cost...

1371
01:26:34,031 --> 01:26:35,225
...more loss...

1372
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,303
...and more agony.

1373
01:26:37,576 --> 01:26:40,011
Come hunt for Easter eggs.

1374
01:26:40,204 --> 01:26:44,357
That's the kids' job. You know I don't like
these tribal rituals, anyway.

1375
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,689
I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.

1376
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:50,228
We're going to Antoine's with the kids!

1377
01:26:50,504 --> 01:26:52,575
I told you I was talking to Shaw.

1378
01:26:52,799 --> 01:26:55,154
In the middle of Easter Sunday?

1379
01:26:55,552 --> 01:26:58,589
When I scheduled it,
I didn't know it was a holiday.

1380
01:26:58,929 --> 01:27:00,568
Look at the calendar!

1381
01:27:00,807 --> 01:27:03,037
You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

1382
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:05,239
Clay Shaw is important.

1383
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:07,590
- And we're not.
- I didn't say that.

1384
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:10,614
I didn't say that.

1385
01:27:11,566 --> 01:27:14,558
You're missing most of your life
and you don't know it.

1386
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:16,735
The kids are missing out, too.

1387
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:21,688
- You're not the only one making sacrifices.
- I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.

1388
01:27:22,785 --> 01:27:24,424
Just start without me.

1389
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:36,565
Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday?

1390
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:38,907
I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.

1391
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:43,496
But this conversation is best kept out
of the everyday bustle of this office.

1392
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,413
I don't understand.

1393
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:49,312
In an investigation we're conducting,
your name keeps coming up.

1394
01:27:50,018 --> 01:27:51,007
Can't imagine where.

1395
01:27:51,687 --> 01:27:54,679
We've talked to a number of men
who claim to know you.

1396
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:57,243
Do you know a David Logan?

1397
01:27:57,443 --> 01:27:59,355
No. Never heard of him.

1398
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:01,397
Perry Russo?

1399
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:02,484
No.

1400
01:28:03,615 --> 01:28:05,128
Willie O'Keefe?

1401
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:08,688
I don't know anyone by that name.

1402
01:28:09,371 --> 01:28:13,047
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you
at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.

1403
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:17,835
Then you had him over for dinner
at your apartment on Dauphine Street.

1404
01:28:18,086 --> 01:28:20,806
- Do you recall that?
- I don't know this man.

1405
01:28:22,132 --> 01:28:23,566
Be still my heart.

1406
01:28:24,009 --> 01:28:26,364
Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.

1407
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,112
Hope you like squab.

1408
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:31,288
Champagne?

1409
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:36,170
Perhaps a few more details about
the evening will refresh your memory.

1410
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:46,524
Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.

1411
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:51,859
You sat at one end and he at the other,
which he found unusual...

1412
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,814
...because the table was so long.

1413
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:56,604
How was your mousse?

1414
01:28:56,747 --> 01:28:58,977
Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

1415
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:00,395
Not at all.

1416
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:02,760
But I do have...

1417
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,230
...a lovely Chippendale dining table.

1418
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:09,060
I often have a friend sit at one end
while I sit at the other.

1419
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:12,503
It's precisely the point
of a long dining table.

1420
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:15,944
The splendor of the meal
adds to its enjoyment.

1421
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:18,344
I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

1422
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:20,908
It adds elegance, for which I confess...

1423
01:29:21,271 --> 01:29:22,989
...a weakness now and then.

1424
01:29:23,565 --> 01:29:24,998
I call him Smedley.

1425
01:29:26,067 --> 01:29:30,220
His real name's Frankie Jenkins,
but it would be so uncouth during dinner...

1426
01:29:31,154 --> 01:29:33,271
...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...

1427
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:34,882
..."Frankie!"

1428
01:29:39,955 --> 01:29:41,832
Where is all this leading to?

1429
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,168
After dinner, you paid him to have sex.

1430
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:49,953
That is absolute nonsense.

1431
01:29:50,797 --> 01:29:54,791
The Quarter is filled
with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.

1432
01:29:55,218 --> 01:29:58,052
Grimy young hoodlums who will say
and do anything!

1433
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:00,238
Mr. O'Keefe told us...

1434
01:30:00,682 --> 01:30:03,834
...David Ferrie came to the house
with another young man.

1435
01:30:06,062 --> 01:30:07,781
- Who?
- David Ferrie.

1436
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:10,741
I don't know that name.

1437
01:30:11,275 --> 01:30:14,791
Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,
I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.

1438
01:30:28,542 --> 01:30:29,941
You're mine, Mary.

1439
01:30:30,877 --> 01:30:33,836
The four of you partied early
into the morning hours.

1440
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:35,568
Look at this picture.

1441
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:39,343
I've never met anyone
of such bizarre appearance.

1442
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:51,940
Only way you get this,
you do exactly what I say. I'm the man.

1443
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,307
You know the name Clay Bertrand?

1444
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:57,838
Clay Bertrand.

1445
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:02,388
A man with a similar name worked
at the Chamber of Commerce.

1446
01:31:02,614 --> 01:31:05,254
- That the man you had in mind?
- No, it was not.

1447
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,405
Can you identify this man?

1448
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:12,667
Naturally. You claim Mr. Oswald
also had dinner with me?

1449
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:15,640
Have you ever met Lee Harvey Oswald?

1450
01:31:16,378 --> 01:31:19,894
You have me consorting
with a sordid cast of characters.

1451
01:31:20,173 --> 01:31:22,607
- Please answer the question.
- 'Course not.

1452
01:31:23,175 --> 01:31:24,928
The assassination was such a pity.

1453
01:31:25,094 --> 01:31:28,610
In fact I admired Kennedy.
Man of true panache.

1454
01:31:28,931 --> 01:31:30,683
Wife of impeccable taste.

1455
01:31:31,307 --> 01:31:34,380
Let's order without your daddy.
He won't mind.

1456
01:31:34,895 --> 01:31:36,568
I want a Shirley Temple!

1457
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:38,925
Kids, put your water guns away.

1458
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:41,121
When's Daddy coming?

1459
01:31:42,193 --> 01:31:43,627
He's coming soon.

1460
01:31:43,987 --> 01:31:47,184
He's sorry he's late,
but he promised he'd be here.

1461
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,879
Daddy never keeps his promises.

1462
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:56,849
This Italian newspaper article says...

1463
01:31:57,624 --> 01:32:01,095
...you were a board member
of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy.

1464
01:32:01,545 --> 01:32:05,505
This company was created by the CIA
for the transfer of funds in Italy...

1465
01:32:05,757 --> 01:32:08,397
...for illegal political-espionage activities.

1466
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,515
Says that this company was expelled
from Italy for those activities.

1467
01:32:12,889 --> 01:32:17,088
I'm well aware of that asinine article.
I'm thinking of suing that rag.

1468
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:21,106
It also says this company is linked
to the Schlumberger Tool Company...

1469
01:32:21,354 --> 01:32:25,030
...in Louisiana, which provided arms
to David Ferrie and his Cubans.

1470
01:32:25,358 --> 01:32:26,711
You're reaching.

1471
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,816
Am I?

1472
01:32:27,944 --> 01:32:31,380
I'm an international businessman.
The Trade Mart I founded...

1473
01:32:31,657 --> 01:32:35,617
...is America's commercial pipeline
to Latin America. I trade everywhere.

1474
01:32:36,578 --> 01:32:39,855
Like all businessmen,
I am accused of all things.

1475
01:32:40,414 --> 01:32:44,454
I go about my business, make money,
help society the best I can...

1476
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:47,304
...and try to promote free trade
in this world.

1477
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:51,840
Have you ever been a contract agent
for the CIA?

1478
01:32:56,721 --> 01:32:58,040
And if I were...

1479
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:02,205
...do you believe I would be here today...

1480
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:05,469
...talking to somebody like you?

1481
01:33:11,234 --> 01:33:13,749
- People like you don't have to.
- May I go?

1482
01:33:13,986 --> 01:33:16,501
People like you walk
between the raindrops.

1483
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,264
May I go?

1484
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:22,241
Yes.

1485
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:35,464
Regardless of what you may think of me,
I am a patriot first and foremost.

1486
01:33:35,758 --> 01:33:38,067
I've spent half my life in the military...

1487
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,013
...defending my country.

1488
01:33:40,178 --> 01:33:44,218
You're the first person I've met who
considers it patriotic to kill the President.

1489
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:46,271
You are way out of line.

1490
01:33:46,892 --> 01:33:50,090
It's getting late.
That's all the questions we have.

1491
01:33:50,646 --> 01:33:53,207
Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in.

1492
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:55,151
I enjoyed meeting with you.

1493
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,193
And you, Miss Cox.
It's been most pleasant.

1494
01:34:04,826 --> 01:34:08,979
I extend to you and your families
my best wishes for a happy Easter.

1495
01:34:18,463 --> 01:34:21,024
"One may smile, and smile
and be a villain."

1496
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:24,538
Goddamn it! We've got one of them.

1497
01:34:24,845 --> 01:34:25,721
See that?

1498
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:44,345
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1499
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:50,308
Tough day.

1500
01:34:50,452 --> 01:34:51,966
Where you been?

1501
01:34:52,996 --> 01:34:54,429
My sympathies.

1502
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:57,779
I'm sorry, the meeting
took much longer than expected.

1503
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,726
Just a second.

1504
01:34:59,878 --> 01:35:02,551
We waited for hours, Jim!

1505
01:35:04,257 --> 01:35:06,054
You could've telephoned.

1506
01:35:06,217 --> 01:35:10,609
I can only say I'm sorry.
I just don't have rabbits on my mind.

1507
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:13,319
You know what I think?

1508
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:16,467
You care more about John Kennedy
than your own family.

1509
01:35:17,102 --> 01:35:20,857
All day the kids asked, "Where's Daddy?"
What should I tell them?

1510
01:35:21,939 --> 01:35:23,258
I don't know!

1511
01:35:23,608 --> 01:35:26,486
The truth! I'm doing my job
to make sure they grow up...

1512
01:35:26,693 --> 01:35:30,687
...in a country where justice won't be
a vanished idea in history books...

1513
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:33,060
...like dinosaurs or Atlantis.

1514
01:35:33,283 --> 01:35:36,117
It doesn't replace a husband
or a father on Easter Sunday.

1515
01:35:36,328 --> 01:35:38,080
It's going to get worse!

1516
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:46,201
I beat you again, you must give me a raise.

1517
01:35:46,378 --> 01:35:48,415
Who can you brag to?

1518
01:35:50,882 --> 01:35:54,080
Who killed President Kennedy?
Was there a conspiracy here?

1519
01:35:54,428 --> 01:35:56,738
I don't know what you're talking about.

1520
01:35:57,723 --> 01:36:00,158
Clear the door! Watch out! Move!

1521
01:36:03,019 --> 01:36:05,170
Congratulations. You're Page One.

1522
01:36:05,438 --> 01:36:10,593
Ain't nice, it says, we've spent over $8,000
on unexplained investigative expenses...

1523
01:36:10,902 --> 01:36:12,541
...since November, 1966.

1524
01:36:12,821 --> 01:36:13,890
Goddamn!

1525
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,232
They went to the public records, got
vouchers we requested for withdrawals.

1526
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,332
Shaw got them on our tail.

1527
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:23,537
It could have been Ferrie,
Martin, Andrews, any of them.

1528
01:36:23,747 --> 01:36:27,376
Or they talked to Ruby 'cause of
they're on our asses for a measly $8,000.

1529
01:36:27,626 --> 01:36:29,696
They're hunting the news,
it's their business.

1530
01:36:29,878 --> 01:36:32,473
You'd think they'd understand
what were doing.

1531
01:36:32,839 --> 01:36:35,513
Getting angry doesn't accomplish
a damn thing.

1532
01:36:37,968 --> 01:36:39,162
Son of a bitch.

1533
01:36:39,929 --> 01:36:42,045
This changes everything now.

1534
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:43,959
What do you mean?

1535
01:36:46,477 --> 01:36:49,948
Either we pull out now
or we go through heavy flak together.

1536
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:56,696
Bear in mind, this may affect
the rest of your careers, your lives.

1537
01:36:58,154 --> 01:37:00,305
Any one who wants to pull out now...

1538
01:37:00,657 --> 01:37:05,652
...I assure you there will be no ill feelings
and I will reassign you to regular duties.

1539
01:37:09,539 --> 01:37:11,690
There it is then, thank you.

1540
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:14,123
It means a great deal to me.

1541
01:37:17,339 --> 01:37:20,730
I'm giving this office $6,000
from my National Guard savings account.

1542
01:37:21,927 --> 01:37:23,326
So we can continue.

1543
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:27,287
I'll make speeches where I can
and make additional money.

1544
01:37:27,932 --> 01:37:30,810
What shall I tell them?
Their piling up outside the door.

1545
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:33,691
They want a statement.
The phones are going crazy.

1546
01:37:33,896 --> 01:37:36,730
I won't confirm, deny nor discuss, Sharon.

1547
01:37:38,482 --> 01:37:40,360
Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.

1548
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:45,207
I'm going home
to get a decent day's work done.

1549
01:37:45,406 --> 01:37:49,116
Mr. Garrison's own silence on the subject
has raised some interesting questions.

1550
01:37:49,368 --> 01:37:52,918
With taxpayer money,
has he uncovered valuable new evidence?

1551
01:37:53,456 --> 01:37:58,053
Or is he merely saving the information
to gain exposure at a national level?

1552
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:01,259
Mr. Garrison should have
some explanation.

1553
01:38:01,546 --> 01:38:03,902
Did your office plant that garbage
in the paper?

1554
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:06,002
- Who is this?
- You know damn well.

1555
01:38:06,175 --> 01:38:08,087
- Dave?
- You got it. Listen.

1556
01:38:08,428 --> 01:38:10,419
You're the only straight-shooter there.

1557
01:38:10,596 --> 01:38:12,474
I want an answer! Did you plant it?

1558
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:16,077
Do you think we're nuts?
It's been a zoo since that broke.

1559
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:18,702
Reporters everywhere.
Do you think we want that?

1560
01:38:18,895 --> 01:38:21,535
Somebody planted that fucking story!

1561
01:38:21,732 --> 01:38:25,282
I'm one of fucking Garrison's suspects.
I can't go home!

1562
01:38:25,568 --> 01:38:28,527
The maggots are everywhere!
Do you know what you've done to me?

1563
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:30,013
Calm down.

1564
01:38:30,156 --> 01:38:31,350
From here on...

1565
01:38:31,617 --> 01:38:33,414
...l'm a fucking dead man!

1566
01:38:33,743 --> 01:38:36,338
You weren't even mentioned in the story.

1567
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:40,277
Meet me in the lobby
of the Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.

1568
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:45,271
I guarantee the boss will protect you.
He likes you. He likes your mind.

1569
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:52,535
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

1570
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:56,873
I suppose I could use a pot of hot coffee
and a few packs of Luckys.

1571
01:38:58,516 --> 01:38:59,711
Anything new?

1572
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,861
Who are you scared of?

1573
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:04,618
Everybody. The Agency, mob, Cubans.

1574
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:07,380
Follow the Cubans.

1575
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:10,358
Check them out. Here, in Miami. Dallas.

1576
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:14,099
Check out Eladio del Valle.

1577
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:17,521
He was my paymaster
when I flew missions into Cuba.

1578
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:21,546
You're on the right track.
Don't write this down!

1579
01:39:21,996 --> 01:39:24,227
I ain't cooperating with no one!

1580
01:39:24,791 --> 01:39:27,545
There's a death warrant for me!
Don't you get it?

1581
01:39:28,085 --> 01:39:29,882
Damn! Wait a minute!

1582
01:39:30,045 --> 01:39:32,799
You ain't bugged, are you?
Son of a bitch, Lou!

1583
01:39:33,299 --> 01:39:34,368
Are you?

1584
01:39:34,758 --> 01:39:36,397
I play square. No bugs.

1585
01:39:36,843 --> 01:39:40,280
I'd love you to go on the record,
but I'm in no hurry.

1586
01:39:40,847 --> 01:39:42,883
I haven't slept since that article.

1587
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:46,892
- Why'd you get me involved?
- Did we involve you? Or did Shaw?

1588
01:39:47,604 --> 01:39:50,437
Cocksucking faggot.
He got me by the balls.

1589
01:39:50,814 --> 01:39:53,727
- What do you mean?
- Photographs, compromising stuff.

1590
01:39:54,276 --> 01:39:55,425
He'll use them, too.

1591
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:57,162
Agency plays for keeps.

1592
01:39:57,488 --> 01:40:01,038
Oswald was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.
I taught him everything.

1593
01:40:01,867 --> 01:40:05,224
He was a wannabe. No one liked him.
Thought he was a snitch.

1594
01:40:05,578 --> 01:40:06,977
But I treated him good.

1595
01:40:07,121 --> 01:40:09,955
He wanted his kid to grow up
with a chance.

1596
01:40:10,708 --> 01:40:12,620
What's this? What's going on?

1597
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:16,153
Don't let him in.

1598
01:40:16,297 --> 01:40:18,049
No one's coming in here.

1599
01:40:21,635 --> 01:40:22,863
Black. Give it to me.

1600
01:40:23,011 --> 01:40:25,480
Black. My neck is killing me.

1601
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:30,186
I've had cancer for years.
Been working with mice to find a cure.

1602
01:40:30,768 --> 01:40:32,441
Did you work for the CIA?

1603
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:36,670
You sound like it's a remote experience
in ancient history.

1604
01:40:37,149 --> 01:40:38,901
You don't leave the Agency.

1605
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:43,069
- Once you're in, they got you for life.
- And Shaw?

1606
01:40:43,698 --> 01:40:46,292
Shaw's an untouchable. Highest clearance.

1607
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:49,294
Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans, all Agency.

1608
01:40:50,828 --> 01:40:51,705
Ruby?

1609
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,628
Jack was a pimp.
A bagman for the Dallas mob.

1610
01:40:59,128 --> 01:41:01,597
Ran guns to Castro
when he was on our side.

1611
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:04,484
Castro was almost with us
till we tried to whack him.

1612
01:41:04,675 --> 01:41:06,586
Everybody keeps flipping sides.

1613
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,274
It's fun and games.

1614
01:41:08,596 --> 01:41:11,828
- How do the mob figure in this?
- They're Agency too.

1615
01:41:12,224 --> 01:41:17,219
The CIA and the Mafia worked together
for years trying to whack out the beard.

1616
01:41:17,896 --> 01:41:20,127
There's more to this than you could dream!

1617
01:41:20,315 --> 01:41:23,432
Check out something called
"Operation Mongoose."

1618
01:41:23,985 --> 01:41:27,057
Government, Pentagon stuff.
They're in charge.

1619
01:41:27,697 --> 01:41:30,291
But who pulls whose chain? Who knows?

1620
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:34,158
"Oh, what a deadly web we weave
when we practice to deceive."

1621
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:35,884
Who killed the President?

1622
01:41:36,038 --> 01:41:38,632
Why don't you fucking stop it? Shit!

1623
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:42,602
This is too big for you, you know that?

1624
01:41:42,794 --> 01:41:47,107
Who did the President? Fuck!
It's a mystery.

1625
01:41:47,674 --> 01:41:50,268
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma!

1626
01:41:50,467 --> 01:41:53,346
The shooters don't even know!
Don't you get it?

1627
01:41:53,596 --> 01:41:56,350
Fuck, man! I can't keep talking like this!

1628
01:41:56,766 --> 01:41:58,643
They'll fucking kill me!

1629
01:41:58,892 --> 01:42:00,531
I'll fucking die!

1630
01:42:04,898 --> 01:42:06,251
Son of a bitch!

1631
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:07,879
It's all right.

1632
01:42:09,819 --> 01:42:11,572
I don't know what happened.

1633
01:42:12,405 --> 01:42:13,520
Fuck!

1634
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:22,396
All I wanted in the world...

1635
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,820
...was to be a Catholic priest.

1636
01:42:28,086 --> 01:42:29,678
Live in a monastery.

1637
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:31,240
Pray. Serve God.

1638
01:42:32,966 --> 01:42:34,081
I had...

1639
01:42:36,553 --> 01:42:38,942
...one terrible fucking weakness.

1640
01:42:39,806 --> 01:42:41,524
And they defrocked me!

1641
01:42:45,811 --> 01:42:48,167
Then I started to lose everything.

1642
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:51,704
You'll be okay, Dave.

1643
01:42:52,067 --> 01:42:55,025
Just talk to us on the record.
We'll protect you.

1644
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:03,168
They'll get to you too.

1645
01:43:04,662 --> 01:43:06,141
They'll destroy you.

1646
01:43:08,124 --> 01:43:09,603
They're untouchable.

1647
01:43:13,295 --> 01:43:16,333
I'm so fucking exhausted,
I can't see straight.

1648
01:43:31,594 --> 01:43:33,391
Early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

1649
01:43:33,554 --> 01:43:36,115
Paris Match,
the largest magazine in France.

1650
01:43:37,098 --> 01:43:39,089
Literaturnaya Gazeta from Moscow.

1651
01:43:39,267 --> 01:43:41,224
Victoria Taylor, Private Eye.

1652
01:43:42,269 --> 01:43:45,182
You know who shot the President?
Mr. Garrison is too busy...

1653
01:43:45,398 --> 01:43:47,867
They're putting the heat on David Ferrie.

1654
01:43:48,693 --> 01:43:51,002
If we wait, he won't hold on.

1655
01:43:53,072 --> 01:43:56,986
He keeps changing his story.
We can't call him to a grand jury.

1656
01:43:58,243 --> 01:44:02,362
He'll keep deteriorating.
We'll get more out of him when he cracks.

1657
01:44:03,623 --> 01:44:07,252
If we call him in now he might freeze up,
we'll lose our best shot.

1658
01:44:08,002 --> 01:44:11,517
He can't go down any further.
We must protect him full time.

1659
01:44:12,715 --> 01:44:15,275
I know what you're going through
with Ferrie.

1660
01:44:15,718 --> 01:44:19,792
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to Washington.

1661
01:44:21,807 --> 01:44:25,084
A lead says he's closely connected
to these events...

1662
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,039
...but he won't come here.

1663
01:44:27,186 --> 01:44:30,179
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,
Eladio del Valle.

1664
01:44:30,732 --> 01:44:33,372
I need more men. I got to get him in.

1665
01:44:33,568 --> 01:44:36,766
I can't pull the teams to watch Ferrie.
I promised him!

1666
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:38,709
This is our case!

1667
01:44:42,117 --> 01:44:43,949
I got something to show you.

1668
01:44:44,369 --> 01:44:46,837
I think you'll find it interesting.

1669
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,460
This was found in your office.

1670
01:44:51,626 --> 01:44:55,301
The conference room is bugged, maybe
the phones. We have to debug the place.

1671
01:44:55,546 --> 01:44:58,425
Bugging the DA's office.
This is outrageous!

1672
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:02,561
Believe what you want,
but we must be more careful.

1673
01:45:02,761 --> 01:45:04,753
All these new volunteers!

1674
01:45:06,056 --> 01:45:09,652
You handle it, okay?
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1675
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:15,346
Well, we obviously got
the bastards worried now.

1676
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:20,393
I'm coming to Washington!

1677
01:45:25,991 --> 01:45:27,710
Dave Ferrie's dead.

1678
01:45:28,411 --> 01:45:30,971
Found his body in his apartment
two hours ago.

1679
01:45:56,395 --> 01:45:57,714
What's it look like?

1680
01:45:57,854 --> 01:46:02,326
I don't see any violence. Heart attack,
maybe an aneurysm. Natural causes.

1681
01:46:02,608 --> 01:46:05,328
This is addressed to no one
and no signature.

1682
01:46:05,736 --> 01:46:08,490
"To leave this life is
for me a sweet prospect.

1683
01:46:08,907 --> 01:46:11,182
"I find nothing in it that is desirable...

1684
01:46:11,367 --> 01:46:14,485
"...and, on the other hand,
everything that is loathsome."

1685
01:46:14,703 --> 01:46:16,342
It goes on and on.

1686
01:46:16,705 --> 01:46:20,858
"Daily we are propagandized more
and more by the rising crime wave."

1687
01:46:21,626 --> 01:46:24,016
Seems pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

1688
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,137
Proloid.

1689
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:51,530
I took it once for a low thyroid condition.

1690
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:54,195
It raises the metabolism.

1691
01:46:55,783 --> 01:46:59,173
Ferrie strike you as the kind of person
with a low metabolism?

1692
01:46:59,411 --> 01:47:02,563
Hardly, I'd say the opposite.
Maybe hypertension.

1693
01:47:03,415 --> 01:47:08,047
Ferrie was the only one to express
any kind of remorse about the whole thing.

1694
01:47:09,838 --> 01:47:11,556
I think it got him killed.

1695
01:47:13,633 --> 01:47:15,271
More bad news from Miami.

1696
01:47:15,551 --> 01:47:18,191
Ferrie's friend, Eladio del Valle,
was found...

1697
01:47:19,263 --> 01:47:21,653
...hacked to death with a machete
in his car.

1698
01:47:21,849 --> 01:47:26,605
He was tortured, shot point-blank
in the heart, his skull split open with an ax.

1699
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:28,698
Ain't that the devil's piss!

1700
01:47:28,856 --> 01:47:31,929
Found another note. Same thing.
No name. No signature.

1701
01:47:32,401 --> 01:47:36,634
"When you receive this, I'll be quite dead,
so no answer is possible.

1702
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,797
- "I offered you love, I got kicked."
- Must've pressed to come up with that.

1703
01:47:44,246 --> 01:47:48,684
What if a man with hypertension
were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

1704
01:47:49,333 --> 01:47:53,771
He'd die quickly. A heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

1705
01:47:54,671 --> 01:47:57,550
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

1706
01:47:57,841 --> 01:47:59,559
Not with a routine autopsy.

1707
01:47:59,801 --> 01:48:03,077
But there may be a high level of iodine
in the spinal fluid.

1708
01:48:03,304 --> 01:48:06,183
But it's difficult to know.
What're you thinking?

1709
01:48:08,393 --> 01:48:11,704
It doesn't make sense.
Would a man afraid of dying...

1710
01:48:12,272 --> 01:48:14,911
...kill himself in a way that leaves no trace?

1711
01:48:16,192 --> 01:48:18,581
And leave two unsigned suicide notes?

1712
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:21,914
If it's a suicide, I've seen weirder.

1713
01:48:22,906 --> 01:48:25,865
The fact is, he's gone. And so is our case.

1714
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:27,638
Unless we go for Shaw now.

1715
01:48:27,786 --> 01:48:30,937
With whose testimony?
O'Keefe, a male prostitute?

1716
01:48:31,748 --> 01:48:34,626
Jack Martin, a drunk?
Vernon Bundy, a dope fiend?

1717
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:38,585
Shaw's got respect. Newspaper editors,
American Bar Association.

1718
01:48:38,837 --> 01:48:42,274
- I agree. We don't have the goods.
- We wait, Shaw will get whacked!

1719
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:45,306
How many corpses do you need
to figure out what's going on?

1720
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:48,026
Watch your mouth! Ferrie did this himself.

1721
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:50,579
Where're you going?

1722
01:48:50,724 --> 01:48:51,999
I don't know.

1723
01:48:52,267 --> 01:48:53,905
I just don't know.

1724
01:48:59,231 --> 01:49:01,666
Frank, you're wasting your time here.

1725
01:49:01,858 --> 01:49:04,134
Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI.

1726
01:49:04,529 --> 01:49:06,121
It's you I want to talk to.

1727
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:08,794
Boss'd fry me in hog fat
if he knew I talked to you.

1728
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:11,299
Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1729
01:49:11,744 --> 01:49:14,895
- We know what's going on at your office.
- I guess you do.

1730
01:49:15,163 --> 01:49:18,952
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1731
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:22,015
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1732
01:49:22,586 --> 01:49:23,541
Enough!

1733
01:49:23,672 --> 01:49:26,664
We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1734
01:49:27,717 --> 01:49:29,469
You're working the Castro thing.

1735
01:49:29,635 --> 01:49:31,068
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

1736
01:49:31,219 --> 01:49:34,530
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1737
01:49:35,264 --> 01:49:37,256
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1738
01:49:37,433 --> 01:49:41,666
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1739
01:49:42,104 --> 01:49:45,097
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1740
01:49:45,525 --> 01:49:46,753
Shut up!

1741
01:49:47,401 --> 01:49:51,441
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1742
01:49:52,782 --> 01:49:54,010
Get in the car.

1743
01:50:16,012 --> 01:50:17,206
Garrison?

1744
01:50:18,472 --> 01:50:19,302
Yes.

1745
01:50:20,557 --> 01:50:21,831
Glad you came.

1746
01:50:22,308 --> 01:50:24,140
Sorry about the precautions.

1747
01:50:24,311 --> 01:50:26,700
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...?

1748
01:50:27,982 --> 01:50:31,577
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1749
01:50:33,278 --> 01:50:37,557
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat...

1750
01:50:38,324 --> 01:50:40,555
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison.

1751
01:50:41,535 --> 01:50:45,165
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1752
01:50:45,497 --> 01:50:48,535
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1753
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,178
Except to say you're close.

1754
01:50:52,587 --> 01:50:54,179
Closer than you think.

1755
01:50:57,967 --> 01:51:00,960
Everything I'll say is classified top secret.

1756
01:51:01,596 --> 01:51:04,395
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1757
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:09,354
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1758
01:51:09,603 --> 01:51:11,355
Planes, bullets, rifles...

1759
01:51:11,772 --> 01:51:14,081
...for what we call "Black Operations."

1760
01:51:14,607 --> 01:51:16,997
Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'tat...

1761
01:51:17,193 --> 01:51:19,913
...rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1762
01:51:21,156 --> 01:51:24,593
In World War II, I was in Romania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1763
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:29,192
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1764
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:32,384
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1765
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:35,105
In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.

1766
01:51:35,293 --> 01:51:37,603
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1767
01:51:38,088 --> 01:51:40,967
Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,
Arbenz in Guatemala...

1768
01:51:41,174 --> 01:51:43,973
...Mossadegh in Iran.
We were in Vietnam in '54...

1769
01:51:44,761 --> 01:51:46,877
...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.

1770
01:51:47,554 --> 01:51:50,786
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1771
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,334
Very good.

1772
01:51:54,353 --> 01:51:56,948
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1773
01:51:57,231 --> 01:52:00,383
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1774
01:52:01,193 --> 01:52:04,391
Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1775
01:52:05,113 --> 01:52:07,547
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1776
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:10,174
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1777
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,026
Understand?

1778
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:14,258
I'll come to that later.

1779
01:52:14,746 --> 01:52:16,544
So, 1963...

1780
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:20,177
I spent much of September of '63...

1781
01:52:20,753 --> 01:52:23,586
...working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel...

1782
01:52:23,797 --> 01:52:26,391
...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1783
01:52:27,092 --> 01:52:30,688
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House...

1784
01:52:31,764 --> 01:52:33,914
...National Security Memo 263...

1785
01:52:34,307 --> 01:52:36,424
...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1786
01:52:37,393 --> 01:52:41,592
But in November, a week after the murder
of Vietnamese President Diem...

1787
01:52:41,856 --> 01:52:44,417
...and two weeks before
Kennedy's assassination...

1788
01:52:44,608 --> 01:52:46,883
...a strange thing happened to me.

1789
01:52:49,446 --> 01:52:51,084
Is Dave in there?

1790
01:52:56,161 --> 01:52:58,072
You wanted to see me, General?

1791
01:52:58,538 --> 01:52:59,733
I do, indeed.

1792
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:02,162
You're going to the South Pole.

1793
01:53:02,917 --> 01:53:03,873
I am?

1794
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:06,382
Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1795
01:53:06,545 --> 01:53:09,185
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1796
01:53:09,965 --> 01:53:12,799
I was sent by my superior,
we'll call him "Y"...

1797
01:53:13,343 --> 01:53:15,938
...I was sent by General Y
to the South Pole...

1798
01:53:16,763 --> 01:53:20,279
...as military escort for a group
of international VIPs.

1799
01:53:20,933 --> 01:53:23,606
I was on my way back, in New Zealand...

1800
01:53:24,562 --> 01:53:26,439
...when the President was killed.

1801
01:53:28,565 --> 01:53:31,842
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p.m.,
Dallas time...

1802
01:53:32,486 --> 01:53:36,605
...with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p.m.
The next day in New Zealand.

1803
01:53:37,615 --> 01:53:40,414
But already their papers
had the entire history...

1804
01:53:40,618 --> 01:53:43,178
...of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.

1805
01:53:43,704 --> 01:53:46,822
Studio picture, detailed biography,
Russian information...

1806
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:49,954
...and were sure that he killed
the President alone...

1807
01:53:50,168 --> 01:53:54,287
...although it took them four more hours
to charge him with that crime in Dallas.

1808
01:53:56,883 --> 01:53:58,475
It felt to me as if...

1809
01:53:59,803 --> 01:54:01,919
...a cover story was being put out.

1810
01:54:02,222 --> 01:54:04,054
Like we would in a Black Op.

1811
01:54:05,934 --> 01:54:07,413
After I came back...

1812
01:54:07,685 --> 01:54:11,076
...I asked myself, why was I,
the chief of Special Ops...

1813
01:54:11,396 --> 01:54:14,116
...sent to the South Pole to do a job...

1814
01:54:14,692 --> 01:54:16,524
...many others could have done?

1815
01:54:16,694 --> 01:54:18,764
I wondered if it could've been because...

1816
01:54:18,946 --> 01:54:21,381
...a routine duty,
if I'd been in Washington...

1817
01:54:21,574 --> 01:54:24,248
...would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1818
01:54:24,451 --> 01:54:27,842
I checked it out and found that someone...

1819
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:32,631
...told the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at Fort Sam Houston...

1820
01:54:33,042 --> 01:54:36,797
...to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1821
01:54:37,964 --> 01:54:39,636
I believe it's a mistake.

1822
01:54:39,924 --> 01:54:44,840
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas...

1823
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:47,215
...to supplement the Secret Service.

1824
01:54:47,388 --> 01:54:50,540
Even if we hadn't let him ride
with the bubble-top off...

1825
01:54:51,184 --> 01:54:54,973
...we would've put 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalk without question.

1826
01:54:55,731 --> 01:54:59,884
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1827
01:55:00,235 --> 01:55:03,033
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1828
01:55:03,236 --> 01:55:05,910
We'd have arrived days ahead,
studied the route...

1829
01:55:06,114 --> 01:55:07,513
...checked all buildings.

1830
01:55:07,657 --> 01:55:10,536
Never would've allowed open windows
overlooking Dealey.

1831
01:55:10,827 --> 01:55:12,864
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1832
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:15,547
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1833
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:18,980
We'd be watching the crowd:
Packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.

1834
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,441
Never would've let a man
open an umbrella.

1835
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:24,467
Never would've let the car slow down
to ten miles an hour.

1836
01:55:24,674 --> 01:55:27,313
Or take that unusual curve
at Houston and Elm.

1837
01:55:28,053 --> 01:55:31,204
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1838
01:55:31,596 --> 01:55:35,989
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1839
01:55:36,602 --> 01:55:40,232
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1840
01:55:41,731 --> 01:55:43,642
Who could have best done this?

1841
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:48,975
Black Ops. People in my business.
My superior might call Col. Reich and say:

1842
01:55:49,321 --> 01:55:53,156
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down."

1843
01:55:54,201 --> 01:55:57,239
That day, some Army intelligence people
were in Dallas.

1844
01:55:57,704 --> 01:55:59,296
I don't know who or why.

1845
01:55:59,832 --> 01:56:01,584
But they weren't protecting clients.

1846
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:04,902
And Oswald. Army Intell had
a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.

1847
01:56:06,671 --> 01:56:08,708
Those files have been destroyed.

1848
01:56:09,132 --> 01:56:13,445
Many strange things were happening.
Oswald had nothing to do with them.

1849
01:56:15,596 --> 01:56:17,906
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1850
01:56:18,099 --> 01:56:21,137
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany...

1851
01:56:21,352 --> 01:56:24,982
...in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1852
01:56:25,314 --> 01:56:30,264
At 12:34 p.m., the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1853
01:56:30,902 --> 01:56:32,859
On the plane back to Washington...

1854
01:56:33,029 --> 01:56:35,259
...word was radioed
from the Situations Room...

1855
01:56:35,448 --> 01:56:39,762
...to Johnson that there was one assassin.
Sound like coincidences to you?

1856
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,053
Not for one moment.

1857
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,981
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1858
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:49,079
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1859
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:52,610
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1860
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:54,943
Nothing was left to chance.

1861
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:58,098
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1862
01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:03,622
Things were never the same after that.

1863
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:07,904
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of...

1864
01:57:09,229 --> 01:57:11,459
...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1865
01:57:11,648 --> 01:57:15,642
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1866
01:57:16,486 --> 01:57:18,204
But there was something...

1867
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:19,720
...deeper.

1868
01:57:20,115 --> 01:57:21,025
Uglier.

1869
01:57:21,282 --> 01:57:24,434
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1870
01:57:24,661 --> 01:57:29,690
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1871
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:33,579
Dulles, by the way,
was General Y's benefactor.

1872
01:57:35,879 --> 01:57:37,517
I got out in '64.

1873
01:57:38,423 --> 01:57:40,062
Resigned my commission.

1874
01:57:41,802 --> 01:57:45,273
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1875
01:57:46,514 --> 01:57:47,914
Is that why?

1876
01:57:48,475 --> 01:57:51,035
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1877
01:57:51,602 --> 01:57:54,879
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1878
01:57:55,857 --> 01:57:58,576
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...

1879
01:57:59,317 --> 01:58:01,195
...keeps them guessing, like a game.

1880
01:58:01,361 --> 01:58:04,434
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: Why?

1881
01:58:04,656 --> 01:58:07,329
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1882
01:58:07,868 --> 01:58:10,940
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1883
01:58:14,665 --> 01:58:15,940
In 1961...

1884
01:58:17,585 --> 01:58:21,022
...right after the Bay of Pigs,
very few people know this...

1885
01:58:21,588 --> 01:58:26,060
...I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.

1886
01:58:26,677 --> 01:58:29,397
These are documents classified top secret.

1887
01:58:30,013 --> 01:58:33,689
In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

1888
01:58:33,933 --> 01:58:37,847
...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs
would be wholly responsible...

1889
01:58:38,187 --> 01:58:41,066
...for all covert paramilitary action
in peacetime.

1890
01:58:41,774 --> 01:58:43,765
This ended the reign of the CIA.

1891
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:47,716
Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,
as JFK promised he would.

1892
01:58:48,114 --> 01:58:50,264
And now he was ordering the military...

1893
01:58:50,449 --> 01:58:52,680
...to help him do it. Unprecedented!

1894
01:58:52,868 --> 01:58:57,260
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

1895
01:58:57,706 --> 01:58:59,697
This and the firing of Allen Dulles...

1896
01:58:59,874 --> 01:59:02,183
...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.

1897
01:59:02,377 --> 01:59:05,575
All were sacred cows in Intell
since World War II.

1898
01:59:06,171 --> 01:59:08,242
They got some very upset people.

1899
01:59:09,382 --> 01:59:12,261
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of...

1900
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:14,540
...bureaucratic resistance.

1901
01:59:15,471 --> 01:59:17,349
But one of the results was...

1902
01:59:17,766 --> 01:59:21,157
...the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department...

1903
01:59:21,978 --> 01:59:23,970
...as Operation Mongoose.

1904
01:59:24,522 --> 01:59:26,672
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

1905
01:59:27,149 --> 01:59:30,108
It was secretly based at Miami University...

1906
01:59:30,652 --> 01:59:33,372
...which has the largest
domestic CIA station...

1907
01:59:33,822 --> 01:59:36,735
...budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1908
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:39,418
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

1909
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:42,930
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

1910
01:59:43,248 --> 01:59:45,717
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

1911
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:48,435
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

1912
01:59:49,003 --> 01:59:51,039
All under the control of General Y.

1913
01:59:51,923 --> 01:59:54,517
He took the rules of covert warfare
he'd used abroad...

1914
01:59:54,717 --> 01:59:56,515
...and brought them to this country.

1915
01:59:56,677 --> 01:59:59,316
Now he had the people,
the equipment, the bases...

1916
01:59:59,513 --> 02:00:01,072
...and the motivation.

1917
02:00:01,348 --> 02:00:05,501
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

1918
02:00:06,102 --> 02:00:08,742
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

1919
02:00:09,189 --> 02:00:10,861
Twenty-one overseas bases.

1920
02:00:11,524 --> 02:00:12,844
Big money.

1921
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:16,223
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

1922
02:00:17,321 --> 02:00:19,073
Nearly 3,000 so far.

1923
02:00:20,116 --> 02:00:23,153
Who makes them?
Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?

1924
02:00:23,535 --> 02:00:27,131
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...

1925
02:00:27,371 --> 02:00:31,285
...to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

1926
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,997
General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.
Who owns that?

1927
02:00:35,213 --> 02:00:39,730
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

1928
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:43,138
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

1929
02:00:43,637 --> 02:00:45,549
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

1930
02:00:45,889 --> 02:00:47,561
No war... no money.

1931
02:00:48,725 --> 02:00:52,196
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison...

1932
02:00:52,438 --> 02:00:53,871
...is for war.

1933
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:58,107
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

1934
02:00:58,734 --> 02:01:01,613
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

1935
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:05,132
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

1936
02:01:05,366 --> 02:01:07,835
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

1937
02:01:08,077 --> 02:01:10,511
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

1938
02:01:10,913 --> 02:01:13,223
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

1939
02:01:14,791 --> 02:01:18,421
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

1940
02:01:19,545 --> 02:01:23,778
Since 1961, they knew Kennedy
was not going to war in Southeast Asia.

1941
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:26,734
Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.

1942
02:01:26,927 --> 02:01:31,240
Something's underway, but it has no face.
Yet, everybody in the loop knows.

1943
02:01:31,598 --> 02:01:33,351
Forget about combat troops.

1944
02:01:33,517 --> 02:01:37,033
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

1945
02:01:38,563 --> 02:01:42,477
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

1946
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:46,068
He can't afford to implement it
before the election.

1947
02:01:46,362 --> 02:01:48,593
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

1948
02:01:48,781 --> 02:01:53,253
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

1949
02:01:53,786 --> 02:01:54,616
What?

1950
02:01:54,745 --> 02:01:56,816
Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.

1951
02:01:57,123 --> 02:01:59,843
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close...

1952
02:02:00,042 --> 02:02:02,681
...why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

1953
02:02:03,085 --> 02:02:04,565
There he goes again.

1954
02:02:04,713 --> 02:02:06,783
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

1955
02:02:07,089 --> 02:02:10,366
Lem said that the Chiefs still think
we should go into Cuba.

1956
02:02:10,593 --> 02:02:11,708
Money's at stake.

1957
02:02:11,845 --> 02:02:13,836
Big money. $100 billion.

1958
02:02:15,264 --> 02:02:18,018
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

1959
02:02:18,225 --> 02:02:22,378
He gave TFX fighter contracts only
to those counties that will matter in '64.

1960
02:02:22,896 --> 02:02:25,536
The people in the loop fight back.
Their way.

1961
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:28,505
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

1962
02:02:28,693 --> 02:02:32,209
We just don't let McNamara
stick his nose in this thing!

1963
02:02:32,864 --> 02:02:36,619
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission...

1964
02:02:36,993 --> 02:02:39,872
...he comes back
and scares the shit out of Kennedy!

1965
02:02:40,246 --> 02:02:41,759
Now I want Max Taylor
on him night and day...

1966
02:02:42,581 --> 02:02:44,413
...like a fly on shit.

1967
02:02:45,209 --> 02:02:49,283
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

1968
02:02:49,546 --> 02:02:51,104
I think it started like that.

1969
02:02:51,256 --> 02:02:52,610
In the wind.

1970
02:02:52,841 --> 02:02:56,152
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

1971
02:02:56,928 --> 02:03:00,399
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

1972
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:04,451
We're going. We need your help.

1973
02:03:04,935 --> 02:03:05,970
When?

1974
02:03:06,562 --> 02:03:09,077
In the fall. Probably in the South.

1975
02:03:09,564 --> 02:03:12,318
- We want you to come up with a plan.
- I can do that.

1976
02:03:12,527 --> 02:03:14,085
Everything is cellularized.

1977
02:03:14,235 --> 02:03:17,672
No one said, "He must die." No vote.
Nothing's on paper.

1978
02:03:18,364 --> 02:03:20,003
There's no one to blame.

1979
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,600
It's as old as the crucifixion.

1980
02:03:23,035 --> 02:03:24,867
Or the military firing squad.

1981
02:03:25,246 --> 02:03:28,080
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

1982
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:30,827
Everybody in the power structure...

1983
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:32,799
...has a plausible deniability.

1984
02:03:32,962 --> 02:03:36,433
No compromising connections
except at the most secret point.

1985
02:03:38,008 --> 02:03:39,760
But it must succeed.

1986
02:03:39,927 --> 02:03:42,521
No matter how many die
or how much it costs...

1987
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,394
...the perpetrators must be
on the winning side...

1988
02:03:45,598 --> 02:03:49,274
...and never subject to prosecution
for anything by anyone.

1989
02:03:49,935 --> 02:03:51,766
That is a coup d'tat.

1990
02:03:55,984 --> 02:03:58,737
Kennedy announces
the Texas trip in September.

1991
02:03:58,944 --> 02:04:02,017
At that moment,
second Oswalds pop up all over Dallas...

1992
02:04:02,614 --> 02:04:05,368
...where they have the mayor
and the cops in their pocket.

1993
02:04:05,575 --> 02:04:07,645
General Y flies in the assassins.

1994
02:04:07,870 --> 02:04:11,385
Maybe from the special camp
we keep near Athens, Greece.

1995
02:04:11,705 --> 02:04:12,582
Pros.

1996
02:04:12,874 --> 02:04:16,231
Maybe be locals, Cubans, Mafia hire.
Separate teams.

1997
02:04:16,753 --> 02:04:18,471
Does it matter who shot...

1998
02:04:19,171 --> 02:04:20,764
...from what rooftop?

1999
02:04:22,174 --> 02:04:23,766
Part of the scenery.

2000
02:04:24,427 --> 02:04:26,816
I keep thinking about that Tuesday...

2001
02:04:27,178 --> 02:04:28,612
...the 26th of November.

2002
02:04:28,764 --> 02:04:30,516
The day after they buried Kennedy.

2003
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:34,357
Gentlemen, I am not going
to let Vietnam go like China did.

2004
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:36,664
I'm committed...

2005
02:04:36,855 --> 02:04:41,168
...not to take our soldiers out of there
till they know we mean business in Asia.

2006
02:04:41,817 --> 02:04:45,015
Lyndon Johnson signs
National Security Memo 273...

2007
02:04:45,321 --> 02:04:47,835
...which reverses
Kennedy's withdrawal policy...

2008
02:04:48,032 --> 02:04:50,705
...and approves covert action
against North Vietnam...

2009
02:04:50,909 --> 02:04:52,946
...provoking the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2010
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:56,238
Just get me elected,
I'll give you the damn war.

2011
02:04:58,166 --> 02:04:59,645
In that document...

2012
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,552
...lay the Vietnam War.

2013
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:11,679
I can't believe they killed him
because he wanted to change things.

2014
02:05:13,055 --> 02:05:16,332
- In our time, in our country!
- They've done it throughout history.

2015
02:05:16,559 --> 02:05:19,835
Kings are killed. Politics is power,
nothing more!

2016
02:05:20,979 --> 02:05:24,097
Don't take my word for it.
Do your own thinking.

2017
02:05:26,901 --> 02:05:28,415
The size of this is...

2018
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:30,594
...beyond me.

2019
02:05:31,196 --> 02:05:32,425
Testify.

2020
02:05:32,573 --> 02:05:34,006
- Me?
- Testify.

2021
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:37,173
No chance in hell.

2022
02:05:37,995 --> 02:05:41,784
No, I'd be arrested and gagged.
Maybe sent to an institution.

2023
02:05:42,499 --> 02:05:43,852
Maybe worse. You too.

2024
02:05:44,667 --> 02:05:48,661
I can give you the background.
You find the foreground, the little things.

2025
02:05:48,921 --> 02:05:52,437
Dig, you're the only one to bring a trial
in Kennedy's murder.

2026
02:05:52,842 --> 02:05:55,072
That's important. It's historic.

2027
02:05:55,844 --> 02:05:57,278
I haven't yet.

2028
02:05:58,096 --> 02:06:00,247
I don't have much of a case.

2029
02:06:01,433 --> 02:06:03,424
You don't have a choice anymore.

2030
02:06:03,768 --> 02:06:07,284
You're a significant threat
to the national security structure.

2031
02:06:07,855 --> 02:06:10,734
They'd have killed you already,
but there's light on you.

2032
02:06:10,941 --> 02:06:13,012
So they'll destroy your credibility.

2033
02:06:13,194 --> 02:06:15,264
They already have in many circles.

2034
02:06:15,695 --> 02:06:16,890
Be honest.

2035
02:06:17,281 --> 02:06:21,355
Your only chance is to come up
with a case. Something. Anything.

2036
02:06:22,077 --> 02:06:24,512
Make arrests. Stir the shitstorm.

2037
02:06:25,373 --> 02:06:26,965
Hope to start...

2038
02:06:27,373 --> 02:06:29,934
...a chain reaction
of people coming forward.

2039
02:06:30,127 --> 02:06:32,039
Then the government will crack.

2040
02:06:32,212 --> 02:06:35,329
Fundamentally, people are suckers
for the truth.

2041
02:06:35,631 --> 02:06:37,862
And the truth is on your side, bubba.

2042
02:06:45,224 --> 02:06:46,737
I just hope you get a break.

2043
02:06:57,527 --> 02:06:59,882
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNED Y - 1917-1963

2044
02:07:32,227 --> 02:07:33,262
Mr. Shaw?

2045
02:07:34,102 --> 02:07:36,378
You are under arrest for conspiracy...

2046
02:07:36,773 --> 02:07:40,926
...and entering into agreement with others
for the purpose of murdering...

2047
02:07:41,276 --> 02:07:42,948
...President John F. Kennedy.

2048
02:07:43,111 --> 02:07:45,546
We have a warrant to search the premises.

2049
02:07:46,113 --> 02:07:47,991
It's my duty to inform you...

2050
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:51,168
...you have the right to remain silent.

2051
02:07:51,452 --> 02:07:52,568
Name?

2052
02:07:53,037 --> 02:07:54,629
Clay La Verne Shaw.

2053
02:07:57,124 --> 02:07:58,159
Address?

2054
02:07:58,375 --> 02:08:00,810
1313 Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

2055
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:04,427
Ever use any aliases?

2056
02:08:04,798 --> 02:08:06,277
Clay Bertrand.

2057
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:16,713
Mr. Clark, are you aware of the charges
filed by District Attorney Garrison?

2058
02:08:16,976 --> 02:08:19,969
Yes, Mr. Shaw was included
in our investigation.

2059
02:08:20,605 --> 02:08:22,880
No connection was found at all.

2060
02:08:23,606 --> 02:08:26,997
If the FBI did investigate him,
why is his name not mentioned...

2061
02:08:27,235 --> 02:08:29,909
...in the entire 26 volumes
of the Warren Report...

2062
02:08:30,113 --> 02:08:32,344
...even if it is to clear his name?

2063
02:08:32,991 --> 02:08:36,587
I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.

2064
02:08:36,953 --> 02:08:40,469
Mr. Garrison has presented
absolutely nothing publicly...

2065
02:08:41,249 --> 02:08:43,558
...which would contradict our findings.

2066
02:08:44,419 --> 02:08:47,456
I know of no fact which would refute...

2067
02:08:48,256 --> 02:08:50,326
...the Commission's conclusion...

2068
02:08:50,591 --> 02:08:53,265
...that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

2069
02:08:55,887 --> 02:08:59,358
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.
Most defendants must wait for trial...

2070
02:08:59,598 --> 02:09:03,148
...before they produce sacred cows
like a Chief Justice...

2071
02:09:03,686 --> 02:09:05,086
...as a character witness...

2072
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:08,428
...who is not under oath
and therefore free from perjury.

2073
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:11,011
Even if it's partly true...

2074
02:09:11,443 --> 02:09:15,278
...you realize you're damaging
the credibility of the country?

2075
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:19,949
Is a government worth preserving
when it lies to the people?

2076
02:09:21,244 --> 02:09:23,121
It's become a dangerous country...

2077
02:09:23,287 --> 02:09:26,758
...when you cannot trust anyone.
When you cannot tell the truth.

2078
02:09:28,292 --> 02:09:31,364
I say let justice be done,
though the heavens fall!

2079
02:09:36,425 --> 02:09:37,619
SPECIAL REPORT

2080
02:09:37,759 --> 02:09:40,718
The JFK Conspiracy:
The Case of Jim Garrison.

2081
02:09:41,638 --> 02:09:45,234
- Honey, this is about you.
- After an investigation in New Orleans...

2082
02:09:45,475 --> 02:09:47,113
...reporters have learned...

2083
02:09:47,268 --> 02:09:50,341
...that District Attorney Jim Garrison
and his staff...

2084
02:09:50,646 --> 02:09:54,196
...have intimidated,
bribed and even drugged witnesses...

2085
02:09:54,441 --> 02:09:59,118
...to attempt to prove a conspiracy
involving businessman Clay Shaw...

2086
02:09:59,947 --> 02:10:02,098
...in the murder of John F. Kennedy.

2087
02:10:02,783 --> 02:10:06,459
John Chancler was a cellmate
of Willie O'Keefe's at Angola.

2088
02:10:07,328 --> 02:10:10,639
He said he'd be cut loose
if he copped to the DA's office.

2089
02:10:10,956 --> 02:10:12,788
I sent him up for burglary.

2090
02:10:14,169 --> 02:10:16,559
And there's his old buddy Miguel Torres.

2091
02:10:16,963 --> 02:10:18,442
We sent him up too.

2092
02:10:18,672 --> 02:10:22,632
They wanted me to say Shaw
was Bertrand. They'd get me a pardon.

2093
02:10:23,134 --> 02:10:26,013
Janet Williams comments
on Willie O'Keefe's...

2094
02:10:26,346 --> 02:10:28,736
...descriptions of having met Oswald.

2095
02:10:29,016 --> 02:10:30,574
Was he a homosexual?

2096
02:10:30,809 --> 02:10:32,960
Not the Lee I knew. Absolutely not.

2097
02:10:33,645 --> 02:10:37,036
Mr. O'Keefe must have seen someone
he thought was Lee Oswald.

2098
02:10:37,356 --> 02:10:40,872
I didn't talk to nobody.
I was on drugs at the hospital.

2099
02:10:41,652 --> 02:10:45,248
I told the FBI that call was a figment
of my imagination.

2100
02:10:45,656 --> 02:10:47,726
I think he's quite ill, mentally.

2101
02:10:47,992 --> 02:10:51,541
With one half of his mind,
he is able to fabricate evidence...

2102
02:10:52,705 --> 02:10:56,858
...then he convinces the other half
that the fabrication is the truth.

2103
02:10:57,459 --> 02:11:01,578
Don't worry. There's only 20
or 30 million people watching this tonight.

2104
02:11:04,007 --> 02:11:06,840
My reputation's all right
with the people watching Laugh In.

2105
02:11:07,051 --> 02:11:09,850
Has he ignored the Mafia connections
to this conspiracy...

2106
02:11:10,054 --> 02:11:13,013
...because he's indebted to the mob?

2107
02:11:13,682 --> 02:11:16,993
The more one looks at Jim Garrison,
the more one finds...

2108
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:22,066
...he has destroyed reputations, spread fear
and suspicion, and worst of all...

2109
02:11:22,606 --> 02:11:25,519
...exploited this nation's sorrow and doubt.

2110
02:11:25,902 --> 02:11:27,733
Jim Garrison has said:

2111
02:11:28,738 --> 02:11:31,775
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall."

2112
02:11:32,366 --> 02:11:34,596
He seeks the truth. So do we.

2113
02:11:46,921 --> 02:11:50,517
Dr. Martin Luther King's beautiful dream
expressed so dramatically...

2114
02:11:50,758 --> 02:11:53,319
...during the 1963 march on Washington...

2115
02:11:53,511 --> 02:11:56,868
...was shattered tonight in Memphis,
Tennessee by an assassin's bullet.

2116
02:11:57,098 --> 02:12:00,171
Police think the single shot came
from across the street.

2117
02:12:00,392 --> 02:12:04,671
They found a Browning automatic rifle,
fitted with a marksman's scope.

2118
02:12:06,106 --> 02:12:07,505
I'll get it.

2119
02:12:10,234 --> 02:12:12,908
Hello, is this Jim Garrison's daughter?

2120
02:12:13,905 --> 02:12:15,736
Virginia or Elizabeth?

2121
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:19,516
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

2122
02:12:19,784 --> 02:12:23,778
Your daddy's entered you
in a beauty contest. Like to be in one?

2123
02:12:24,957 --> 02:12:26,185
I don't know.

2124
02:12:26,333 --> 02:12:28,564
My God! What have they done?

2125
02:12:29,878 --> 02:12:31,357
It's lynching time.

2126
02:12:34,257 --> 02:12:35,690
That sounds fun.

2127
02:12:36,467 --> 02:12:38,537
You get out of school at 3:00?

2128
02:12:38,802 --> 02:12:40,316
Who are you talking to?

2129
02:12:40,471 --> 02:12:42,223
That's all I need to know.

2130
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:45,224
Mommy, I'm going to be
in a beauty contest.

2131
02:12:45,601 --> 02:12:47,637
Who is this? Who is this?

2132
02:12:50,188 --> 02:12:52,783
Did you enter Virginia in a beauty contest?

2133
02:12:53,149 --> 02:12:55,788
A man called and asked her height,
her weight...

2134
02:12:55,986 --> 02:12:58,945
Some crackpot.
Martin Luther King was killed.

2135
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:00,839
Her life's been threatened!

2136
02:13:00,991 --> 02:13:03,983
A crank making calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the office.

2137
02:13:04,202 --> 02:13:06,670
Our home! A kidnapper, a murderer!

2138
02:13:07,245 --> 02:13:08,918
Only cowards make crank calls.

2139
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:10,769
Nothing will happen.

2140
02:13:10,999 --> 02:13:15,312
You don't know what goes on here
anymore! You're busy making speeches!

2141
02:13:15,837 --> 02:13:18,511
Getting every crazed Klansman after us!

2142
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:23,073
I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!
I can't stand it anymore!

2143
02:13:23,344 --> 02:13:26,098
- The government wants us scared.
- You and your government!

2144
02:13:26,305 --> 02:13:29,855
They want everybody too scared
to speak out. They count on it.

2145
02:13:30,184 --> 02:13:33,063
- There's nothing to fear!
- Don't you have feelings?

2146
02:13:35,022 --> 02:13:36,695
Your own daughter!

2147
02:13:37,191 --> 02:13:39,227
What kind of a man are you?

2148
02:13:42,695 --> 02:13:46,530
I'll take them to my mother's.
You spend a week.

2149
02:13:46,991 --> 02:13:49,665
I'll change the locks, the phones.
I'll get a bodyguard.

2150
02:13:49,869 --> 02:13:51,780
Get a hold of yourself!

2151
02:13:52,205 --> 02:13:55,675
Before this Kennedy thing,
your children mattered most.

2152
02:13:56,209 --> 02:13:59,042
The other night you didn't
even notice Jasper.

2153
02:13:59,294 --> 02:14:01,365
He came to me bawling his eyes out.

2154
02:14:01,547 --> 02:14:04,346
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

2155
02:14:04,841 --> 02:14:06,513
Is it such a chore?

2156
02:14:06,676 --> 02:14:10,465
Goddamn it! If I said I'll spend
more time with him, I will!

2157
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:13,331
I cannot fight you and the whole world too!

2158
02:14:13,516 --> 02:14:16,190
I'm not fighting you!
I'm trying to reach you.

2159
02:14:16,727 --> 02:14:19,446
- You've changed.
- Of course I've changed!

2160
02:14:20,315 --> 02:14:21,873
My eyes have opened.

2161
02:14:22,399 --> 02:14:25,119
And what once looked normal
seems insane.

2162
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:28,835
And now King. Don't you think
this has something to do with that?

2163
02:14:29,073 --> 02:14:30,142
Can't you see?

2164
02:14:30,281 --> 02:14:34,070
I don't want to see, goddamn it!
I'm tired. I've had enough!

2165
02:14:34,744 --> 02:14:38,579
You're ruining this man Shaw's life
because he's a homosexual.

2166
02:14:38,873 --> 02:14:40,353
That's not why!

2167
02:14:40,834 --> 02:14:43,871
Did you ever once stop
to consider his feelings?

2168
02:14:46,422 --> 02:14:47,980
You don't believe me?

2169
02:14:48,383 --> 02:14:50,977
- I don't know!
- You never believed me?

2170
02:14:52,261 --> 02:14:55,856
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2171
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:57,892
I want my life back!

2172
02:14:59,058 --> 02:15:00,811
So do I, goddamn it!

2173
02:15:01,477 --> 02:15:03,433
I had a life too, you know!

2174
02:15:03,896 --> 02:15:07,526
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2175
02:15:07,941 --> 02:15:12,221
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2176
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:17,524
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2177
02:15:17,743 --> 02:15:19,779
My life is fucked because of it.

2178
02:15:20,162 --> 02:15:23,199
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2179
02:15:23,414 --> 02:15:25,087
You never talked to me this way.

2180
02:15:25,249 --> 02:15:27,285
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2181
02:15:27,459 --> 02:15:30,258
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2182
02:15:30,462 --> 02:15:31,861
I'm leaving you!

2183
02:15:32,131 --> 02:15:34,565
- I'm taking the children!
- Go on! Get out!

2184
02:15:34,758 --> 02:15:36,192
- I am!
- Go hide!

2185
02:15:36,427 --> 02:15:38,577
Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2186
02:15:38,762 --> 02:15:41,231
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2187
02:15:43,016 --> 02:15:46,248
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2188
02:15:47,479 --> 02:15:49,869
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2189
02:15:50,273 --> 02:15:51,547
Somebody!

2190
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:57,811
Are we going away, Daddy?

2191
02:16:05,287 --> 02:16:06,925
I don't know, Jasper.

2192
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:09,025
Because of Kennedy?

2193
02:16:09,958 --> 02:16:12,427
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2194
02:16:15,296 --> 02:16:17,049
Nobody will kill us.

2195
02:16:17,798 --> 02:16:18,867
I'm scared.

2196
02:16:20,176 --> 02:16:22,974
I don't like it when you and Mommy fight.

2197
02:16:25,973 --> 02:16:27,884
I don't like it either, honey.

2198
02:16:29,017 --> 02:16:30,973
Why do we have to leave?

2199
02:16:31,853 --> 02:16:33,890
Don't you love us anymore?

2200
02:16:36,816 --> 02:16:38,613
Daddy loves you both.

2201
02:16:40,362 --> 02:16:43,593
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2202
02:16:43,989 --> 02:16:47,027
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2203
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:51,038
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2204
02:16:52,165 --> 02:16:54,725
But if you let yourself be too scared...

2205
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:58,034
...then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2206
02:16:59,754 --> 02:17:01,507
Then everybody gets scared.

2207
02:17:02,673 --> 02:17:04,346
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2208
02:17:04,509 --> 02:17:05,703
Please.

2209
02:17:13,434 --> 02:17:14,662
Here's another.

2210
02:17:14,893 --> 02:17:18,125
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena...

2211
02:17:18,355 --> 02:17:22,554
...on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBI agent.

2212
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:25,420
What'd you expect from a pig but a grunt?

2213
02:17:25,737 --> 02:17:29,856
Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2214
02:17:30,199 --> 02:17:31,518
What's going on?

2215
02:17:31,742 --> 02:17:34,860
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2216
02:17:35,245 --> 02:17:37,237
Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2217
02:17:37,415 --> 02:17:39,167
No, she could get hurt.

2218
02:17:39,666 --> 02:17:41,897
Look what's happening to other people.

2219
02:17:42,086 --> 02:17:44,078
She's the best witness we have.

2220
02:17:44,255 --> 02:17:47,213
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2221
02:17:48,466 --> 02:17:51,776
You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2222
02:17:53,137 --> 02:17:57,575
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2223
02:17:58,726 --> 02:18:02,402
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2224
02:18:05,398 --> 02:18:09,392
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2225
02:18:10,779 --> 02:18:14,295
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2226
02:18:15,616 --> 02:18:16,606
But this is.

2227
02:18:18,077 --> 02:18:19,795
Any more on Oswald or Shaw?

2228
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:24,823
They were seen together in Clinton
in early September.

2229
02:18:25,209 --> 02:18:28,839
The Civil Rights Movement
was running a voter's registration drive.

2230
02:18:29,422 --> 02:18:32,574
Rumor is, Shaw was working
on some arms deal...

2231
02:18:32,841 --> 02:18:35,309
...to discredit the Civil Rights Movement.

2232
02:18:35,718 --> 02:18:38,711
Nobody really knows
what they were doing there, but...

2233
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:41,001
...hell, they stood out like cotton balls.

2234
02:18:41,182 --> 02:18:43,776
I got whites and coloreds
that saw them there.

2235
02:18:43,976 --> 02:18:47,287
Last time I checked,
it was not illegal to register to vote.

2236
02:18:48,356 --> 02:18:49,994
We still got the...

2237
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:54,711
...the junkie, Vernon Bundy,
who saw him talking at the sea wall.

2238
02:18:55,529 --> 02:18:58,169
This is tough.
No one wants to talk about Shaw.

2239
02:18:58,615 --> 02:19:00,095
You keep saying that.

2240
02:19:00,451 --> 02:19:02,885
- I keep saying what?
- You're not digging deep enough.

2241
02:19:03,077 --> 02:19:05,876
You want to do my job!
You do my job, I'll do your job.

2242
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:08,436
I think Clinton is a breakthrough now.

2243
02:19:10,209 --> 02:19:12,485
Shaw denies ever knowing Oswald, right?

2244
02:19:13,754 --> 02:19:15,392
That proves he's a liar.

2245
02:19:17,424 --> 02:19:19,142
- Keep on it, Bill.
- This is the interesting part.

2246
02:19:19,968 --> 02:19:22,085
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks...

2247
02:19:22,262 --> 02:19:23,980
...before the assassination.

2248
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:25,937
May I see Special Agent Hosty?

2249
02:19:26,098 --> 02:19:28,135
He's not in. Can someone else help you?

2250
02:19:28,309 --> 02:19:32,018
Special Agent Hosty made three visits
to Janet Williams' house...

2251
02:19:32,438 --> 02:19:35,032
...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.

2252
02:19:35,232 --> 02:19:38,031
Hosty told a newspaperman
it was a warning...

2253
02:19:38,486 --> 02:19:41,797
...to stop questioning Marina
when Oswald was not present.

2254
02:19:42,072 --> 02:19:46,510
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her to Russia.

2255
02:19:47,535 --> 02:19:49,686
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2256
02:19:50,246 --> 02:19:52,761
Hosty tore it up
and flushed it down the toilet.

2257
02:19:52,958 --> 02:19:54,596
This is just speculation.

2258
02:19:54,958 --> 02:19:58,588
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2259
02:20:05,094 --> 02:20:06,607
Come on, think!

2260
02:20:07,095 --> 02:20:09,326
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2261
02:20:09,765 --> 02:20:13,520
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2262
02:20:14,144 --> 02:20:17,774
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2263
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,551
Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley...

2264
02:20:20,733 --> 02:20:22,166
...the day he was arrested?

2265
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:25,038
Quigley destroyed the notes
from the interview.

2266
02:20:25,446 --> 02:20:29,235
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant...

2267
02:20:30,075 --> 02:20:34,752
...but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17...

2268
02:20:35,454 --> 02:20:39,368
...warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2269
02:20:41,961 --> 02:20:45,875
William Walter, the FBI night clerk,
gave me a copy.

2270
02:20:46,465 --> 02:20:49,105
It went all over the country.
Nothing was done.

2271
02:20:49,301 --> 02:20:52,931
The motorcade went ahead on schedule.
The Warren Report didn't mention it.

2272
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:56,969
"A militant group may attempt
to assassinate President Kennedy...

2273
02:20:57,226 --> 02:20:59,182
"...on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas."

2274
02:20:59,686 --> 02:21:01,359
Shortly after the assassination...

2275
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:05,435
...Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files...

2276
02:21:05,858 --> 02:21:08,419
...as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2277
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:12,130
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2278
02:21:12,782 --> 02:21:16,253
I have a hunch Oswald
had infiltrated this group:

2279
02:21:16,661 --> 02:21:18,856
Cubans or right-wing extremists.

2280
02:21:19,621 --> 02:21:22,932
He was told to be
at the Book Depository that day...

2281
02:21:23,458 --> 02:21:26,257
...to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2282
02:21:26,961 --> 02:21:30,318
Either they told him
they'd close down the plotters...

2283
02:21:31,465 --> 02:21:32,865
...or simulate an attack...

2284
02:21:33,009 --> 02:21:35,284
...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...

2285
02:21:35,469 --> 02:21:38,542
...so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2286
02:21:39,472 --> 02:21:41,543
What they told him doesn't matter.

2287
02:21:42,183 --> 02:21:43,616
He was under orders.

2288
02:21:43,768 --> 02:21:45,521
He was a foot soldier.

2289
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:50,909
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2290
02:21:52,194 --> 02:21:53,422
I don't buy it.

2291
02:21:53,861 --> 02:21:55,772
Why would the FBI cover it up?

2292
02:21:56,155 --> 02:21:59,750
A telex disappears from every FBI office
in this country?

2293
02:22:00,493 --> 02:22:01,972
There's a word, Bill.

2294
02:22:02,202 --> 02:22:04,113
- Orders.
- Or a cover-up.

2295
02:22:05,247 --> 02:22:08,160
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBI's complicity yet?

2296
02:22:08,375 --> 02:22:10,605
I respect this country's institutions!

2297
02:22:12,962 --> 02:22:16,194
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going...

2298
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:21,102
...between the mob, CIA, FBI, Army
intelligence and who knows what else...

2299
02:22:21,512 --> 02:22:25,222
...when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2300
02:22:25,558 --> 02:22:27,514
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2301
02:22:27,684 --> 02:22:29,880
We are going to trial, y'all!

2302
02:22:30,562 --> 02:22:32,633
What the hell do we really got?

2303
02:22:32,898 --> 02:22:35,731
Oswald, Ruby, Banister,
and Ferrie are dead.

2304
02:22:36,568 --> 02:22:39,207
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2305
02:22:39,529 --> 02:22:41,088
But as a covert operator...

2306
02:22:41,239 --> 02:22:44,630
...he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2307
02:22:44,868 --> 02:22:48,578
Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2308
02:22:49,247 --> 02:22:52,285
But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2309
02:22:52,583 --> 02:22:55,222
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2310
02:22:55,418 --> 02:22:56,898
You will lose!

2311
02:22:57,254 --> 02:22:59,927
We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2312
02:23:00,215 --> 02:23:03,287
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2313
02:23:04,594 --> 02:23:07,984
Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,
sets him up.

2314
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:12,725
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2315
02:23:13,227 --> 02:23:16,538
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms...

2316
02:23:16,772 --> 02:23:19,650
...because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2317
02:23:20,443 --> 02:23:23,753
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us...

2318
02:23:24,111 --> 02:23:26,023
...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2319
02:23:26,197 --> 02:23:28,553
So they close the book on JFK.

2320
02:23:30,243 --> 02:23:31,676
Makes perfect sense to me.

2321
02:23:31,828 --> 02:23:34,707
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2322
02:23:35,622 --> 02:23:37,898
Could the mob change the parade route?

2323
02:23:38,292 --> 02:23:40,966
Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2324
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:44,417
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2325
02:23:44,965 --> 02:23:49,357
Get the FBI, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2326
02:23:49,761 --> 02:23:52,959
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2327
02:23:53,598 --> 02:23:57,672
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2328
02:23:58,186 --> 02:24:01,543
Since when has the mob used anything
but.38's for hits up close?

2329
02:24:03,482 --> 02:24:07,556
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2330
02:24:07,944 --> 02:24:09,901
Assassins need payrolls...

2331
02:24:10,489 --> 02:24:12,481
...schedules, times, orders.

2332
02:24:13,491 --> 02:24:15,880
This was a military-style ambush.

2333
02:24:16,327 --> 02:24:19,683
A coup d'tat with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2334
02:24:20,122 --> 02:24:23,752
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2335
02:24:24,461 --> 02:24:27,692
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root...

2336
02:24:28,004 --> 02:24:30,360
...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2337
02:24:30,632 --> 02:24:33,670
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2338
02:24:33,969 --> 02:24:37,360
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBI bugging our offices?

2339
02:24:37,597 --> 02:24:40,271
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2340
02:24:40,683 --> 02:24:44,153
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2341
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:45,912
I don't know.

2342
02:24:46,314 --> 02:24:49,193
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2343
02:24:49,483 --> 02:24:51,553
With a full-blown cover-up?

2344
02:24:53,029 --> 02:24:54,940
You ever read Shakespeare?

2345
02:24:57,658 --> 02:24:58,773
I do.

2346
02:24:59,492 --> 02:25:00,972
Julius Caesar?

2347
02:25:01,828 --> 02:25:04,980
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men."

2348
02:25:05,873 --> 02:25:07,465
Who killed Caesar?

2349
02:25:08,334 --> 02:25:10,245
Ten or twelve Senators.

2350
02:25:10,544 --> 02:25:12,581
All it takes is one Judas.

2351
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:16,259
A few people on the inside. Pentagon, CIA.

2352
02:25:16,718 --> 02:25:18,390
This is Louisiana.

2353
02:25:19,053 --> 02:25:23,286
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2354
02:25:24,391 --> 02:25:26,621
You are taking a crap in the wind.

2355
02:25:27,101 --> 02:25:29,980
And I am not going along on this one.

2356
02:25:40,197 --> 02:25:42,916
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2357
02:25:43,575 --> 02:25:45,407
He's been fighting us.

2358
02:25:46,828 --> 02:25:48,147
We need him back.

2359
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:50,775
He wasted a month trying to prove...

2360
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:54,556
...that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2361
02:25:54,878 --> 02:25:57,074
- I don't trust him.
- I will not hear this.

2362
02:25:57,255 --> 02:26:00,008
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2363
02:26:01,425 --> 02:26:05,260
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2364
02:26:06,722 --> 02:26:09,601
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm...

2365
02:26:10,267 --> 02:26:12,098
...just plain dumb about it.

2366
02:26:12,269 --> 02:26:14,908
I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2367
02:26:15,104 --> 02:26:17,665
- I don't trust him.
- Did you two hear me?

2368
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:20,170
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2369
02:26:20,443 --> 02:26:23,640
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2370
02:26:25,072 --> 02:26:26,664
Is this an ultimatum?

2371
02:26:28,409 --> 02:26:30,047
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2372
02:26:30,201 --> 02:26:32,318
If that's what you want to call it.

2373
02:26:34,622 --> 02:26:36,693
I never thought it'd come to this.

2374
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:41,614
I guess I am.

2375
02:26:42,964 --> 02:26:47,356
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2376
02:26:51,763 --> 02:26:53,243
You sure got it.

2377
02:26:58,645 --> 02:27:01,160
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2378
02:27:03,607 --> 02:27:05,439
You're making a big mistake.

2379
02:27:12,908 --> 02:27:15,502
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2380
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:18,543
No, I don't think I am.

2381
02:27:20,206 --> 02:27:21,356
Anyone else?

2382
02:27:26,504 --> 02:27:29,178
Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison...

2383
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,753
...the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.

2384
02:27:39,265 --> 02:27:40,381
APPLAUSE

2385
02:27:47,565 --> 02:27:49,716
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

2386
02:27:50,651 --> 02:27:53,883
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

2387
02:27:54,572 --> 02:27:57,883
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

2388
02:27:58,785 --> 02:28:02,335
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

2389
02:28:02,579 --> 02:28:03,978
Then the mob...

2390
02:28:04,248 --> 02:28:08,845
Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBI...

2391
02:28:09,128 --> 02:28:10,402
...and the Pentagon...

2392
02:28:10,546 --> 02:28:15,496
...and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

2393
02:28:17,510 --> 02:28:19,660
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald...

2394
02:28:19,845 --> 02:28:22,918
...who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

2395
02:28:25,643 --> 02:28:27,520
Let's just say this, Jerry...

2396
02:28:28,312 --> 02:28:29,825
...l've stopped beating my wife.

2397
02:28:32,107 --> 02:28:35,259
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

2398
02:28:39,614 --> 02:28:42,687
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media...

2399
02:28:42,908 --> 02:28:45,184
...Time, Newsweek, our own NBC...

2400
02:28:45,786 --> 02:28:49,575
...that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor...

2401
02:28:50,665 --> 02:28:53,544
...that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses...

2402
02:28:53,753 --> 02:28:56,746
...bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

2403
02:28:57,297 --> 02:28:58,696
Do you have a response?

2404
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:02,038
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

2405
02:29:02,385 --> 02:29:05,264
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

2406
02:29:05,472 --> 02:29:06,905
But ask yourself...

2407
02:29:07,056 --> 02:29:09,651
...if we had learned
on November 22, 1963...

2408
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:13,127
...that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building...

2409
02:29:13,354 --> 02:29:15,231
...by a lonely capitalist sympathizer...

2410
02:29:15,397 --> 02:29:19,516
...who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours...

2411
02:29:19,776 --> 02:29:21,495
...while surrounded by armed police.

2412
02:29:21,653 --> 02:29:24,008
I think it would be apparent to anyone...

2413
02:29:24,196 --> 02:29:28,316
...that a coup d'tat and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

2414
02:29:28,951 --> 02:29:32,661
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

2415
02:29:33,039 --> 02:29:35,269
We would, in a free-thinking society...

2416
02:29:35,457 --> 02:29:39,451
...be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

2417
02:29:40,296 --> 02:29:43,493
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

2418
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:46,958
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand...

2419
02:29:47,635 --> 02:29:49,354
...what I'm talking about.

2420
02:29:50,597 --> 02:29:52,110
These are arrests.

2421
02:29:52,515 --> 02:29:55,951
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

2422
02:29:56,185 --> 02:29:58,381
They were never shown to the public.

2423
02:29:58,562 --> 02:30:00,758
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

2424
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:03,374
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

2425
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:06,540
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

2426
02:30:06,903 --> 02:30:09,498
They can't. We have libel laws.

2427
02:30:09,865 --> 02:30:13,654
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

2428
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:15,582
They were never seen again.

2429
02:30:15,745 --> 02:30:18,704
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

2430
02:30:19,124 --> 02:30:20,319
Hold that thought.

2431
02:30:20,458 --> 02:30:23,131
We'll be back,
right after these commercials.

2432
02:30:34,429 --> 02:30:36,546
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

2433
02:30:36,723 --> 02:30:40,717
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

2434
02:30:41,853 --> 02:30:44,414
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

2435
02:30:44,897 --> 02:30:46,046
No. Look...

2436
02:30:46,524 --> 02:30:50,359
...I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

2437
02:30:51,236 --> 02:30:54,434
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

2438
02:30:54,865 --> 02:30:57,858
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

2439
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:02,415
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

2440
02:31:02,789 --> 02:31:05,827
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors...

2441
02:31:06,042 --> 02:31:08,158
...about someone going to be killed?

2442
02:31:08,336 --> 02:31:10,975
- Yes, I do, but this is...
- No, there is no "but."

2443
02:31:11,171 --> 02:31:13,732
There is no "but" in a military situation!

2444
02:31:14,467 --> 02:31:17,460
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me...

2445
02:31:17,678 --> 02:31:19,987
...nor your inability
to follow a simple order...

2446
02:31:20,179 --> 02:31:24,379
...especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

2447
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:26,989
Let's get you a ticket.

2448
02:31:28,522 --> 02:31:31,116
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

2449
02:31:32,066 --> 02:31:33,466
Get a receipt.

2450
02:32:20,862 --> 02:32:22,500
Come on, come on. He's out here.

2451
02:32:22,654 --> 02:32:25,727
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

2452
02:32:34,541 --> 02:32:38,455
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

2453
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,275
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

2454
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:33,105
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

2455
02:33:33,304 --> 02:33:36,456
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

2456
02:33:36,682 --> 02:33:40,197
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

2457
02:33:40,436 --> 02:33:41,755
Left everything.

2458
02:33:42,354 --> 02:33:44,026
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

2459
02:33:44,189 --> 02:33:46,988
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

2460
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:49,078
Something sure scared him.

2461
02:33:49,236 --> 02:33:52,069
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

2462
02:33:52,279 --> 02:33:55,272
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

2463
02:33:56,493 --> 02:33:59,769
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

2464
02:34:01,039 --> 02:34:03,348
You know what's happening, he's winning.

2465
02:34:05,751 --> 02:34:07,628
He'll never make it.

2466
02:34:08,462 --> 02:34:11,977
If he wins, they'll kill him.
He'll stop the war.

2467
02:34:13,883 --> 02:34:16,682
They'll kill him
before they let him be President.

2468
02:34:22,142 --> 02:34:24,532
With Broussard, they have everything...

2469
02:34:24,728 --> 02:34:27,288
...all our witnesses,
our strategies for the trial.

2470
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:29,152
We got to double check his work.

2471
02:34:29,315 --> 02:34:32,068
There could be false leads.
We can't go to trial!

2472
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:33,679
We don't have a prayer!

2473
02:34:33,818 --> 02:34:36,811
- I don't think so, Al.
- I have to agree with Al, Boss.

2474
02:34:37,531 --> 02:34:39,886
This is not one we'll come out on.

2475
02:34:40,074 --> 02:34:43,272
You remember the Hemingway story,
The Old Man and the Sea?

2476
02:34:44,286 --> 02:34:47,245
The old fisherman manages
to catch this great fish...

2477
02:34:47,914 --> 02:34:51,749
...a fish so huge, that he has to tie it
to the boat to get it back in.

2478
02:34:52,252 --> 02:34:53,971
By the time it reached shore...

2479
02:34:54,129 --> 02:34:57,167
...the fish had long since been picked apart
by sharks.

2480
02:35:00,928 --> 02:35:02,646
Nothing was left, but the skeleton.

2481
02:35:02,804 --> 02:35:06,593
- And that's what will happen to us.
- Then what did we do this for?

2482
02:35:06,849 --> 02:35:08,442
It's a means to an end.

2483
02:35:09,018 --> 02:35:10,895
This war has two fronts.

2484
02:35:12,397 --> 02:35:16,437
In a court of law,
we hope to get Clay Shaw for conspiracy.

2485
02:35:16,776 --> 02:35:20,531
In the court of public opinion,
it could take another 25, 30 years...

2486
02:35:20,904 --> 02:35:22,781
...for the truth to come out.

2487
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:27,418
At least we'll strike the first blow.

2488
02:35:29,121 --> 02:35:30,600
What if you're wrong?

2489
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:37,265
I never thought for a second I was.

2490
02:35:41,049 --> 02:35:43,085
Will you come to the trial?

2491
02:35:44,718 --> 02:35:45,468
I don't think so.

2492
02:35:47,721 --> 02:35:53,002
With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Sen. Kennedy has a 48% to 41% lead...

2493
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:54,823
...over Sen. McCarthy.

2494
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:57,489
CBS News projects Sen. Robert Kennedy...

2495
02:35:57,689 --> 02:36:00,044
...the winner of the California primary.

2496
02:36:00,358 --> 02:36:04,398
Within the United States over the period
of the last three years...

2497
02:36:04,737 --> 02:36:08,936
...the division, the violence,
the disenchantment with our society...

2498
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:11,430
...the divisions between blacks
and whites...

2499
02:36:11,618 --> 02:36:14,736
...the poor and the affluent,
between age groups...

2500
02:36:14,996 --> 02:36:17,431
...or Vietnam, we can work together.

2501
02:36:17,707 --> 02:36:21,417
We are a great country, an unselfish,
compassionate country.

2502
02:36:21,669 --> 02:36:24,308
That's my basis for running.

2503
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:31,850
Thank you all.
It's on to Chicago and let's win there.

2504
02:36:44,942 --> 02:36:46,853
Senator Kennedy has been shot!

2505
02:37:29,774 --> 02:37:31,366
They killed him, honey.

2506
02:37:34,028 --> 02:37:35,302
He won...

2507
02:37:35,696 --> 02:37:37,927
...and they killed Robert Kennedy.

2508
02:37:40,034 --> 02:37:41,468
They shot him down.

2509
02:37:43,787 --> 02:37:45,141
Oh, my God!

2510
02:37:47,957 --> 02:37:49,311
Both of them?

2511
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:51,689
Both brothers?

2512
02:37:57,133 --> 02:37:58,566
You were right.

2513
02:38:00,636 --> 02:38:02,388
It hasn't ended yet.

2514
02:38:10,145 --> 02:38:11,817
For the first time...

2515
02:38:13,565 --> 02:38:15,476
...I feel really scared.

2516
02:38:28,413 --> 02:38:30,643
I wish I could've loved you more.

2517
02:38:33,709 --> 02:38:37,988
Sometimes I feel like
I didn't ever love you...

2518
02:38:39,088 --> 02:38:41,000
...or the children enough.

2519
02:38:43,092 --> 02:38:44,366
I'm sorry.

2520
02:39:28,134 --> 02:39:29,409
Please rise.

2521
02:39:32,138 --> 02:39:36,656
The Criminal District Court for Orleans
Parish, Section H, is now in session.

2522
02:39:37,352 --> 02:39:41,187
Honorable Judge Edward A. Haggerty, Jr.
Presiding. Be seated.

2523
02:39:46,777 --> 02:39:48,130
That's Clay Bertrand.

2524
02:39:48,278 --> 02:39:50,156
That's who I saw at Ferrie's.

2525
02:39:50,363 --> 02:39:52,115
That's who you say you saw.

2526
02:39:53,367 --> 02:39:54,959
A confessed homosexual.

2527
02:39:56,202 --> 02:39:58,478
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

2528
02:39:59,371 --> 02:40:01,602
A man who has lied about everything...

2529
02:40:02,207 --> 02:40:04,676
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

2530
02:40:04,877 --> 02:40:07,391
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

2531
02:40:07,796 --> 02:40:10,027
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

2532
02:40:10,799 --> 02:40:13,109
...with the man who shot the President.

2533
02:40:14,093 --> 02:40:16,528
I remember him because of his limp.

2534
02:40:16,805 --> 02:40:19,603
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

2535
02:40:20,141 --> 02:40:22,337
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

2536
02:40:22,518 --> 02:40:25,272
- Is that the man?
- That was the man, right there.

2537
02:40:25,646 --> 02:40:27,716
He dropped Oswald off on the voter's line.

2538
02:40:28,190 --> 02:40:31,581
I remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that day.

2539
02:40:31,818 --> 02:40:35,289
That big black Cadillac of his
made me think they might be FBI.

2540
02:40:35,655 --> 02:40:38,614
Welcome to Clinton.
If you need any help, let us know.

2541
02:40:38,825 --> 02:40:42,580
He said he was a representative
of Warren International Trade Mart.

2542
02:40:43,288 --> 02:40:45,849
More than five years ago,
for two minutes...?

2543
02:40:46,666 --> 02:40:48,817
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

2544
02:40:49,002 --> 02:40:51,038
Just a figment of my imagination.

2545
02:40:51,378 --> 02:40:54,098
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

2546
02:40:54,339 --> 02:40:57,093
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

2547
02:40:57,510 --> 02:41:01,106
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

2548
02:41:01,346 --> 02:41:02,415
Objection, Your Honor!

2549
02:41:02,556 --> 02:41:05,867
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

2550
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:08,535
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

2551
02:41:09,688 --> 02:41:10,916
Mr. Goldberg...

2552
02:41:11,396 --> 02:41:14,070
...you claim you met Ferrie and Shaw
on a vacation trip...

2553
02:41:14,275 --> 02:41:16,426
...from your accounting business
in New York.

2554
02:41:16,611 --> 02:41:17,885
You had drinks...

2555
02:41:18,028 --> 02:41:20,258
...and while drunk,
discussed killing Kennedy.

2556
02:41:20,447 --> 02:41:22,403
- Is that not so?
- Yes, I did.

2557
02:41:22,657 --> 02:41:27,015
Is it also true that you fingerprinted
your daughter when she went to college?

2558
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:28,736
Yes, sir, I did.

2559
02:41:28,872 --> 02:41:32,627
Is it also true that you fingerprinted her
when she returned?

2560
02:41:33,042 --> 02:41:34,111
Yes, I did.

2561
02:41:34,543 --> 02:41:35,532
Why?

2562
02:41:35,962 --> 02:41:39,080
I wanted to make sure
she was the same girl I sent away.

2563
02:41:42,426 --> 02:41:44,337
He was one of Broussard's witnesses.

2564
02:41:44,511 --> 02:41:47,105
He was totally sane
when we took his affidavit.

2565
02:41:47,305 --> 02:41:51,424
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

2566
02:41:52,143 --> 02:41:54,533
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

2567
02:41:54,813 --> 02:41:57,089
Gentlemen, will you please rise
and follow me.

2568
02:41:57,274 --> 02:42:00,152
- Name?
- Clay La Verne Shaw.

2569
02:42:00,401 --> 02:42:02,438
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

2570
02:42:02,611 --> 02:42:05,604
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

2571
02:42:05,823 --> 02:42:07,222
I call them as I see them!

2572
02:42:07,366 --> 02:42:08,561
Any aliases?

2573
02:42:08,742 --> 02:42:09,936
Clay Bertrand.

2574
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:15,750
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

2575
02:42:16,667 --> 02:42:19,545
- I'm ruling that inadmissible!
- That's our case!

2576
02:42:19,835 --> 02:42:21,986
Then you didn't have a case.

2577
02:42:22,630 --> 02:42:25,429
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

2578
02:42:25,634 --> 02:42:27,590
I can't believe you're saying this!

2579
02:42:27,759 --> 02:42:29,910
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

2580
02:42:34,099 --> 02:42:36,169
- Oswald?
- No, I did not.

2581
02:42:37,561 --> 02:42:40,679
- Ever call Dean Andrews?
- No, I did not.

2582
02:42:42,190 --> 02:42:44,466
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

2583
02:42:45,735 --> 02:42:49,251
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

2584
02:42:50,656 --> 02:42:52,887
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

2585
02:42:53,075 --> 02:42:55,145
No, I did not.

2586
02:42:56,496 --> 02:42:58,248
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

2587
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:04,652
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

2588
02:43:05,128 --> 02:43:07,483
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

2589
02:43:08,130 --> 02:43:12,010
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

2590
02:43:12,301 --> 02:43:16,501
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

2591
02:43:16,806 --> 02:43:19,240
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

2592
02:43:19,641 --> 02:43:21,439
That's the man right there.

2593
02:43:28,484 --> 02:43:31,521
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

2594
02:43:32,153 --> 02:43:36,306
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

2595
02:43:37,117 --> 02:43:38,186
To do that...

2596
02:43:38,325 --> 02:43:41,796
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

2597
02:43:42,663 --> 02:43:44,973
The American public has not seen...

2598
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:52,280
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

2599
02:43:52,923 --> 02:43:55,357
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

2600
02:43:56,468 --> 02:43:58,220
There's a reason for that.

2601
02:43:59,512 --> 02:44:00,422
Watch.

2602
02:44:50,810 --> 02:44:53,041
"The picture speaks 1,000 words."

2603
02:44:54,855 --> 02:44:57,893
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2604
02:44:58,109 --> 02:44:59,940
Three bullets, one assassin.

2605
02:45:01,070 --> 02:45:04,346
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

2606
02:45:04,573 --> 02:45:09,887
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

2607
02:45:10,745 --> 02:45:14,819
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

2608
02:45:15,207 --> 02:45:17,722
...while standing near the triple underpass.

2609
02:45:17,918 --> 02:45:21,389
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

2610
02:45:21,839 --> 02:45:24,228
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2611
02:45:24,759 --> 02:45:28,719
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

2612
02:45:29,179 --> 02:45:33,378
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2613
02:45:34,309 --> 02:45:36,186
That leaves just two bullets.

2614
02:45:36,728 --> 02:45:40,004
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2615
02:45:42,024 --> 02:45:43,776
So a single bullet remains.

2616
02:45:44,109 --> 02:45:48,627
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2617
02:45:49,656 --> 02:45:52,694
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

2618
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:55,265
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

2619
02:45:55,453 --> 02:45:58,651
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2620
02:45:58,873 --> 02:46:02,184
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2621
02:46:03,877 --> 02:46:06,267
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2622
02:46:07,131 --> 02:46:08,565
The magic bullet...

2623
02:46:08,799 --> 02:46:13,032
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2624
02:46:13,762 --> 02:46:18,314
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

2625
02:46:18,975 --> 02:46:20,454
...wound #2...

2626
02:46:20,977 --> 02:46:22,968
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

2627
02:46:23,771 --> 02:46:27,447
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

2628
02:46:28,275 --> 02:46:30,107
...right, then left...

2629
02:46:30,610 --> 02:46:33,887
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2630
02:46:34,323 --> 02:46:35,597
Wound #3.

2631
02:46:36,324 --> 02:46:41,161
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

2632
02:46:41,830 --> 02:46:45,506
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

2633
02:46:46,334 --> 02:46:50,806
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2634
02:46:51,797 --> 02:46:53,072
Wound #5.

2635
02:46:53,799 --> 02:46:55,630
Shattering the radius bone...

2636
02:46:55,801 --> 02:46:58,555
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

2637
02:46:59,179 --> 02:47:03,571
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2638
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:06,934
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

2639
02:47:07,645 --> 02:47:10,285
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

2640
02:47:10,815 --> 02:47:13,774
...on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.

2641
02:47:16,403 --> 02:47:17,632
Some bullet.

2642
02:47:19,531 --> 02:47:22,604
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

2643
02:47:22,826 --> 02:47:25,341
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2644
02:47:26,371 --> 02:47:31,002
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2645
02:47:31,709 --> 02:47:33,143
Of course they can.

2646
02:47:33,295 --> 02:47:36,527
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

2647
02:47:36,756 --> 02:47:38,826
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

2648
02:47:39,716 --> 02:47:41,992
But use your eyes, your common sense.

2649
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:46,839
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2650
02:47:47,558 --> 02:47:50,027
Not one of them looked anything like this.

2651
02:47:51,686 --> 02:47:53,678
Take a look at CE-856.

2652
02:47:54,814 --> 02:47:56,372
An identical bullet...

2653
02:47:56,609 --> 02:47:59,328
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

2654
02:48:00,069 --> 02:48:03,028
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2655
02:48:04,156 --> 02:48:05,795
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2656
02:48:06,117 --> 02:48:07,391
Tough skin...

2657
02:48:07,909 --> 02:48:09,423
...dense bones.

2658
02:48:10,662 --> 02:48:12,733
This single-bullet explanation...

2659
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:16,829
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2660
02:48:17,585 --> 02:48:18,904
And once you conclude...

2661
02:48:19,045 --> 02:48:22,083
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

2662
02:48:22,381 --> 02:48:26,170
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

2663
02:48:27,928 --> 02:48:30,159
And if there was a second rifleman...

2664
02:48:30,681 --> 02:48:33,879
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

2665
02:48:34,434 --> 02:48:37,552
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

2666
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:43,396
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

2667
02:48:43,943 --> 02:48:46,902
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

2668
02:48:48,113 --> 02:48:49,752
Key witnesses that day?

2669
02:48:50,574 --> 02:48:52,725
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

2670
02:48:53,452 --> 02:48:55,886
Right behind, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

2671
02:48:56,664 --> 02:48:59,224
S.M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

2672
02:48:59,624 --> 02:49:02,139
...standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...

2673
02:49:02,335 --> 02:49:04,007
...overlooking the plaza.

2674
02:49:04,963 --> 02:49:07,602
William Newman, father of two children.

2675
02:49:07,882 --> 02:49:10,317
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

2676
02:49:11,677 --> 02:49:13,270
Abraham Zapruder.

2677
02:49:30,070 --> 02:49:33,029
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

2678
02:49:33,323 --> 02:49:36,360
...one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence.

2679
02:49:37,369 --> 02:49:40,520
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

2680
02:49:40,746 --> 02:49:44,341
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

2681
02:49:46,794 --> 02:49:48,273
Doctor Peters.

2682
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:53,432
There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

2683
02:49:53,759 --> 02:49:56,558
A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.

2684
02:49:58,221 --> 02:50:02,852
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

2685
02:50:03,226 --> 02:50:05,343
...along with the underlying brain tissue.

2686
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:07,988
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

2687
02:50:08,564 --> 02:50:12,477
There was also a large fragment of skull
attached to a flap of the scalp.

2688
02:50:12,943 --> 02:50:16,778
The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm...

2689
02:50:17,073 --> 02:50:18,665
...or five inches, across.

2690
02:50:18,823 --> 02:50:22,612
Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President...

2691
02:50:23,202 --> 02:50:26,513
...regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.

2692
02:50:27,373 --> 02:50:30,810
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

2693
02:50:31,043 --> 02:50:33,194
Because when a coup d'tat has occurred...

2694
02:50:33,378 --> 02:50:37,611
...there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...

2695
02:50:37,883 --> 02:50:41,274
...and one that is performed
by military doctors under orders.

2696
02:50:42,554 --> 02:50:47,390
The departure of Air Force One, Friday
afternoon was not so much a takeoff...

2697
02:50:47,683 --> 02:50:50,756
...as it was a getaway,
with the newly sworn in President.

2698
02:50:50,978 --> 02:50:52,047
Objection!

2699
02:50:52,187 --> 02:50:53,098
Sustained.

2700
02:50:53,231 --> 02:50:57,623
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

2701
02:50:57,902 --> 02:51:01,532
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

2702
02:51:01,947 --> 02:51:04,781
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

2703
02:51:04,992 --> 02:51:07,426
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

2704
02:51:09,329 --> 02:51:11,206
Please bottle the acid.

2705
02:51:13,416 --> 02:51:18,093
The three Bethesda doctors picked by
the military left something to be desired.

2706
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:21,891
None of them had experience
with combat-gunfire wounds.

2707
02:51:22,466 --> 02:51:26,779
Through their autopsy, we've been able
to justify eight wounds from two bullets.

2708
02:51:27,095 --> 02:51:29,371
Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.

2709
02:51:29,556 --> 02:51:31,786
One of them being the "magic bullet."

2710
02:51:32,058 --> 02:51:33,458
- FBI?
- Here.

2711
02:51:33,602 --> 02:51:37,232
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

2712
02:51:37,480 --> 02:51:40,632
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

2713
02:51:41,526 --> 02:51:42,720
Oh, Christ.

2714
02:51:42,944 --> 02:51:44,617
Looks like half his brain is gone.

2715
02:51:44,778 --> 02:51:47,008
- Weigh it.
- 653 grams.

2716
02:51:47,197 --> 02:51:50,190
As a pathologist, it was your obligation
to explore...

2717
02:51:50,409 --> 02:51:52,206
...all possible causes of death.

2718
02:51:52,369 --> 02:51:53,883
I had the cause of death.

2719
02:51:54,037 --> 02:51:57,314
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

2720
02:51:58,416 --> 02:52:01,568
Why did Col. Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

2721
02:52:01,794 --> 02:52:03,705
I heard Dr. Humes stating...

2722
02:52:04,046 --> 02:52:06,038
That's enough. That's enough.

2723
02:52:06,256 --> 02:52:07,609
It's duly noted.

2724
02:52:08,133 --> 02:52:09,726
Let's check the back.

2725
02:52:17,476 --> 02:52:19,751
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

2726
02:52:19,936 --> 02:52:21,768
That won't be necessary.

2727
02:52:24,649 --> 02:52:26,128
Watch the ear!

2728
02:52:27,568 --> 02:52:29,799
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

2729
02:52:30,195 --> 02:52:31,150
He said:

2730
02:52:31,447 --> 02:52:33,086
Who's in charge here?

2731
02:52:33,533 --> 02:52:34,568
I am.

2732
02:52:35,909 --> 02:52:37,309
I don't remember his name.

2733
02:52:38,037 --> 02:52:39,595
It was quite crowded.

2734
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:43,676
And when you are called to look
at the wounds of the dead President...

2735
02:52:43,916 --> 02:52:46,875
...you don't ask people for their names
and who they are.

2736
02:52:47,087 --> 02:52:51,081
But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was the Army General?

2737
02:52:51,798 --> 02:52:52,595
No.

2738
02:52:53,509 --> 02:52:54,828
But you took his orders.

2739
02:52:55,552 --> 02:52:56,382
Yes.

2740
02:52:56,596 --> 02:52:58,905
- So he was directing the autopsy.
- No.

2741
02:52:59,265 --> 02:53:01,257
There were others.

2742
02:53:02,184 --> 02:53:03,663
There were admirals.

2743
02:53:05,979 --> 02:53:08,813
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

2744
02:53:09,024 --> 02:53:13,416
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

2745
02:53:13,695 --> 02:53:16,573
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

2746
02:53:17,031 --> 02:53:20,148
...specifically told us
not to discuss the case.

2747
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:26,079
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

2748
02:53:26,706 --> 02:53:29,175
...none of the American people's business.

2749
02:53:29,376 --> 02:53:31,367
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

2750
02:53:31,544 --> 02:53:34,935
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

2751
02:53:35,423 --> 02:53:38,097
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

2752
02:53:38,301 --> 02:53:41,738
...filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.

2753
02:53:42,221 --> 02:53:44,941
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2754
02:53:46,225 --> 02:53:50,014
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2755
02:53:51,312 --> 02:53:55,511
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

2756
02:53:56,108 --> 02:53:59,419
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

2757
02:53:59,654 --> 02:54:00,929
...we're told...

2758
02:54:01,823 --> 02:54:05,658
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2759
02:54:09,247 --> 02:54:12,718
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

2760
02:54:12,959 --> 02:54:17,317
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government...

2761
02:54:18,172 --> 02:54:19,730
Overruled!

2762
02:54:26,845 --> 02:54:28,916
So, what really happened that day?

2763
02:54:29,599 --> 02:54:32,113
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2764
02:54:32,685 --> 02:54:35,404
We have the epileptic seizure...

2765
02:54:35,604 --> 02:54:39,439
...distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.

2766
02:54:40,608 --> 02:54:44,522
The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.

2767
02:54:45,947 --> 02:54:48,906
The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.

2768
02:54:49,201 --> 02:54:52,238
They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week...

2769
02:54:52,452 --> 02:54:54,967
...allowing unknown workmen
in the building.

2770
02:54:55,790 --> 02:54:59,147
They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.

2771
02:54:59,834 --> 02:55:04,226
The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.

2772
02:55:05,048 --> 02:55:06,242
The God spot.

2773
02:55:06,675 --> 02:55:11,272
B-team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building...

2774
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:14,519
...moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.

2775
02:55:15,641 --> 02:55:20,193
The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll...

2776
02:55:20,730 --> 02:55:25,122
...where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.

2777
02:55:26,068 --> 02:55:27,979
They have the best position.

2778
02:55:28,654 --> 02:55:31,646
Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.

2779
02:55:32,323 --> 02:55:34,235
Part of this team is a coordinator...

2780
02:55:34,409 --> 02:55:38,562
...who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.

2781
02:55:39,830 --> 02:55:43,426
Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.

2782
02:55:43,918 --> 02:55:47,389
Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.

2783
02:55:48,088 --> 02:55:52,560
The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.

2784
02:55:53,802 --> 02:55:55,440
They blocked the plaza.

2785
02:55:55,929 --> 02:55:57,648
They know every inch.

2786
02:55:59,640 --> 02:56:03,236
They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.

2787
02:56:04,519 --> 02:56:05,714
They're ready.

2788
02:56:06,605 --> 02:56:09,757
Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.

2789
02:56:10,859 --> 02:56:12,851
It's going to be a turkey shoot.

2790
02:56:14,613 --> 02:56:16,604
They don't shoot him on Houston...

2791
02:56:16,782 --> 02:56:20,013
...the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.

2792
02:56:20,534 --> 02:56:24,130
They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.

2793
02:56:25,540 --> 02:56:28,498
Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.

2794
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:32,692
Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.

2795
02:56:33,548 --> 02:56:37,224
The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.

2796
02:56:39,177 --> 02:56:42,773
Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green!"

2797
02:56:43,306 --> 02:56:45,582
Or, "Abort! Abort!"

2798
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:53,653
The first shot rings out.

2799
02:56:54,650 --> 02:56:57,688
Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.

2800
02:56:58,279 --> 02:57:01,238
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2801
02:57:01,908 --> 02:57:04,468
Connally's head turns slightly to the right.

2802
02:57:04,869 --> 02:57:08,623
Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.

2803
02:57:09,581 --> 02:57:12,779
Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.

2804
02:57:13,251 --> 02:57:16,527
He's been hit, raising his hands
to his throat.

2805
02:57:17,338 --> 02:57:19,488
The third shot, frame 232...

2806
02:57:19,798 --> 02:57:23,189
...hits Kennedy in the back,
pulling him downward and forward.

2807
02:57:23,677 --> 02:57:26,715
Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.

2808
02:57:27,097 --> 02:57:31,011
He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.

2809
02:57:31,268 --> 02:57:33,021
Connally is turning now.

2810
02:57:33,187 --> 02:57:35,542
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

2811
02:57:35,772 --> 02:57:38,924
It misses Kennedy and takes Connally
in the back.

2812
02:57:39,358 --> 02:57:42,157
This is the shot that proves
there were two rifles.

2813
02:57:42,361 --> 02:57:45,718
Connally yells, "My God!
They're going to kill us all!"

2814
02:57:46,115 --> 02:57:49,347
Around this time,
another shot misses the car completely...

2815
02:57:49,619 --> 02:57:52,087
...striking James Teague by the underpass.

2816
02:57:53,122 --> 02:57:54,316
The car brakes.

2817
02:57:54,623 --> 02:57:56,295
The sixth and fatal shot.

2818
02:57:56,540 --> 02:57:59,851
Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head
from the front.

2819
02:58:01,505 --> 02:58:03,097
This is the key shot.

2820
02:58:03,797 --> 02:58:06,676
The President going back and to his left...

2821
02:58:07,009 --> 02:58:09,080
...shot from the front and right.

2822
02:58:10,137 --> 02:58:13,414
Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository.

2823
02:58:13,724 --> 02:58:14,634
Again.

2824
02:58:18,604 --> 02:58:20,435
Back, and to the left.

2825
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:23,692
Back, and to the left.

2826
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:26,869
Back, and to the left.

2827
02:58:29,322 --> 02:58:31,074
So what happens then?

2828
02:58:33,576 --> 02:58:34,770
Pandemonium.

2829
02:58:37,747 --> 02:58:39,578
Let's go! We got him!

2830
02:58:45,170 --> 02:58:49,767
The shooters quickly disassemble their
various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.

2831
02:59:01,102 --> 02:59:04,378
Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot
behind the fence.

2832
02:59:05,188 --> 02:59:06,541
He smells gunpowder.

2833
02:59:06,690 --> 02:59:10,286
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

2834
02:59:11,527 --> 02:59:14,088
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

2835
02:59:15,365 --> 02:59:17,641
I accepted that and let him go.

2836
02:59:18,701 --> 02:59:21,614
I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.

2837
02:59:22,538 --> 02:59:26,532
He had on a sports shirt and pants,
but he had dirty fingernails.

2838
02:59:28,543 --> 02:59:31,342
Afterward, it didn't ring true.
But at the time...

2839
02:59:31,546 --> 02:59:33,503
...we were so pressed for time.

2840
02:59:34,466 --> 02:59:37,345
All Secret Servicemen
in Dallas are accounted for.

2841
02:59:38,261 --> 02:59:41,379
None were on foot in Dealey Plaza
before or after the shooting...

2842
02:59:41,598 --> 02:59:45,308
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

2843
02:59:46,226 --> 02:59:49,902
The Dallas police took at least 12 people
into custody.

2844
02:59:51,065 --> 02:59:52,623
No record of their arrest.

2845
02:59:52,775 --> 02:59:56,290
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

2846
02:59:56,653 --> 02:59:59,043
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

2847
02:59:59,239 --> 03:00:01,390
Yet there's no record of their arrest.

2848
03:00:01,574 --> 03:00:05,170
Men identifying themselves
as Secret Service agents were everywhere.

2849
03:00:06,245 --> 03:00:08,201
But who was impersonating them?

2850
03:00:08,580 --> 03:00:10,094
Where was Oswald?

2851
03:00:10,833 --> 03:00:14,907
Around 12: 15, leaving the building
to see the motorcade...

2852
03:00:15,170 --> 03:00:18,129
...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald
in the second-floor snack room...

2853
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:20,490
...where he said he went for a Coke.

2854
03:00:21,259 --> 03:00:24,376
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

2855
03:00:25,013 --> 03:00:28,528
He was by himself as usual,
appeared to be having lunch.

2856
03:00:29,016 --> 03:00:31,894
I didn't speak to him,
but I recognized him clearly.

2857
03:00:32,353 --> 03:00:36,826
At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is
supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.

2858
03:00:37,525 --> 03:00:40,278
He's there until 12: 15, maybe 12:20.

2859
03:00:41,153 --> 03:00:42,666
He sees nobody.

2860
03:00:43,362 --> 03:00:47,641
Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,
sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...

2861
03:00:47,908 --> 03:00:51,265
...presumably after Williams
finished his lunch and left.

2862
03:00:52,037 --> 03:00:55,792
John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor
of the county jail, sees them.

2863
03:00:56,041 --> 03:00:57,441
Many of us saw them.

2864
03:00:57,584 --> 03:01:01,373
Everyone was hollering and yelling.
We thought they was security guys.

2865
03:01:02,214 --> 03:01:06,652
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

2866
03:01:07,469 --> 03:01:10,906
Later, he told police he was
in the second-floor snack room.

2867
03:01:11,347 --> 03:01:14,385
Probably told to wait there
by his handler for a call.

2868
03:01:16,143 --> 03:01:18,135
But the phone call never came.

2869
03:01:18,812 --> 03:01:21,373
Maximum 90 seconds
after Kennedy is shot...

2870
03:01:21,566 --> 03:01:25,355
...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald
in that second-floor lunchroom.

2871
03:01:26,987 --> 03:01:28,579
Is this man an employee?

2872
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:31,413
Yes. The President's been shot.

2873
03:01:31,616 --> 03:01:33,573
The Commission would have us believe...

2874
03:01:33,744 --> 03:01:37,135
...that after firing three bolt-action shots
in 5.6 seconds...

2875
03:01:37,747 --> 03:01:42,060
...Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...

2876
03:01:42,418 --> 03:01:46,810
...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft...

2877
03:01:48,007 --> 03:01:50,238
...sprints down five flights of stairs...

2878
03:01:50,426 --> 03:01:53,783
...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him...

2879
03:01:54,679 --> 03:01:58,992
...then shows up, cool and calm, on the
second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.

2880
03:02:00,685 --> 03:02:03,758
All this within a maximum of 90 seconds
of the shooting.

2881
03:02:04,605 --> 03:02:06,562
Is this man an employee?

2882
03:02:06,732 --> 03:02:08,723
Yes. The President's been shot.

2883
03:02:08,943 --> 03:02:10,422
Is he out of breath?

2884
03:02:10,944 --> 03:02:13,413
According to Baker, absolutely not.

2885
03:02:13,864 --> 03:02:18,620
Assuming he is the sole assassin,
Oswald is free to leave the building.

2886
03:02:19,452 --> 03:02:23,685
The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by police.

2887
03:02:24,707 --> 03:02:27,939
Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase?

2888
03:02:30,212 --> 03:02:31,850
He buys a Coke...

2889
03:02:32,172 --> 03:02:36,246
...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid
on the second floor...

2890
03:02:36,802 --> 03:02:39,236
...he strolls out
the more distant front exit...

2891
03:02:39,429 --> 03:02:41,022
...where cops have gathered.

2892
03:02:41,181 --> 03:02:44,139
Odd, since three shots were fired
from there...

2893
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:47,229
...nobody seals the Depository
for ten more minutes.

2894
03:02:47,729 --> 03:02:50,528
Oswald slips out,
as do several other employees.

2895
03:02:50,982 --> 03:02:54,896
When he realized something had gone
wrong and Kennedy had been killed...

2896
03:02:55,569 --> 03:02:59,358
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

2897
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:04,030
An intuition, maybe. The President killed
in spite of his warning.

2898
03:03:04,286 --> 03:03:06,164
The phone call that never came.

2899
03:03:06,330 --> 03:03:09,528
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

2900
03:03:11,251 --> 03:03:14,403
Oswald returns to his rooming house
around 1:00 p. M...

2901
03:03:14,629 --> 03:03:16,939
...a half hour after the assassination.

2902
03:03:17,257 --> 03:03:18,895
A man shot the President!

2903
03:03:19,050 --> 03:03:21,929
He puts on his jacket,
grabs his.38 revolver...

2904
03:03:22,178 --> 03:03:24,009
...and leaves at 1:04.

2905
03:03:24,679 --> 03:03:27,672
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,
heard two beeps on a car horn.

2906
03:03:27,891 --> 03:03:31,282
Two uniformed cops pulled up
while Oswald was in his room.

2907
03:03:31,519 --> 03:03:33,033
Like it was a signal.

2908
03:03:34,189 --> 03:03:38,468
Officer Tippit is shot between 1: 10
and 1: 15, a mile away.

2909
03:03:38,776 --> 03:03:41,291
And though no one saw him walking...

2910
03:03:41,612 --> 03:03:44,331
...the government says
Oswald covered that distance.

2911
03:03:44,532 --> 03:03:46,967
Giving the government the benefit
of the doubt...

2912
03:03:47,159 --> 03:03:50,152
...Oswald would've had to jog a mile
in six to eleven minutes...

2913
03:03:50,371 --> 03:03:53,045
...then commit the murder,
reverse his direction...

2914
03:03:53,248 --> 03:03:56,160
...and walk three-fifths of a mile
to the Texas Theater...

2915
03:03:56,376 --> 03:03:58,845
...and arrive sometime before 1:30.

2916
03:04:04,383 --> 03:04:06,022
It's also a useful conclusion.

2917
03:04:06,177 --> 03:04:08,611
After all, why would Oswald
kill Officer Tippit...

2918
03:04:08,805 --> 03:04:11,842
...unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest?

2919
03:04:12,557 --> 03:04:14,310
Domingo Benevides...

2920
03:04:15,978 --> 03:04:18,129
...the closest witness to the shooting...

2921
03:04:18,314 --> 03:04:22,388
...refused to identify Oswald as the killer
and was never taken to a lineup.

2922
03:04:23,026 --> 03:04:24,141
Acquilla Clemons...

2923
03:04:24,276 --> 03:04:27,986
...saw the killer and another man
go off in separate directions.

2924
03:04:28,489 --> 03:04:32,005
Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup
or to the Warren Commission.

2925
03:04:32,786 --> 03:04:36,665
At the scene, Officer Poe marks
his initials on the shells...

2926
03:04:36,956 --> 03:04:39,072
...to record the chain of evidence.

2927
03:04:39,541 --> 03:04:42,340
Those initials are not
on the three cartridge cases...

2928
03:04:42,544 --> 03:04:44,934
...which the Warren Commission show him.

2929
03:04:45,380 --> 03:04:49,169
As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes
after the assassination...

2930
03:04:49,884 --> 03:04:53,878
...the police put out a description
matching Oswald's size and build.

2931
03:04:54,722 --> 03:04:59,399
Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,
Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.

2932
03:05:00,351 --> 03:05:04,790
Oswald is scared. He begins to realize
the full implications of this thing.

2933
03:05:05,065 --> 03:05:08,694
He goes to the Texas Theater,
possibly a prearranged meeting point.

2934
03:05:09,152 --> 03:05:13,669
Though he has $14 in his pocket,
he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.

2935
03:05:14,198 --> 03:05:16,393
Brewer has the cashier call the police.

2936
03:05:16,575 --> 03:05:18,646
In response to that call...

2937
03:05:19,161 --> 03:05:23,314
...at least 30 officers in patrol cars descend
on the movie theater.

2938
03:05:23,832 --> 03:05:27,030
This is the most remarkable example
of police intuition...

2939
03:05:27,336 --> 03:05:29,407
...since the Reichstag fire.

2940
03:05:30,255 --> 03:05:31,483
I don't buy it!

2941
03:05:31,673 --> 03:05:35,667
They knew. Someone knew
Oswald would be there.

2942
03:05:36,428 --> 03:05:38,738
Brewer leads the cops into the theater...

2943
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:40,967
...and from the stage, points Oswald out.

2944
03:05:41,141 --> 03:05:42,176
There he is.

2945
03:05:54,611 --> 03:05:56,887
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

2946
03:06:02,869 --> 03:06:07,227
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

2947
03:06:07,540 --> 03:06:09,020
They have their man.

2948
03:06:10,084 --> 03:06:12,838
It's already been decided in Washington.

2949
03:06:13,754 --> 03:06:16,188
When he is brought from the theater...

2950
03:06:16,589 --> 03:06:18,865
...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.

2951
03:06:19,218 --> 03:06:22,609
Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.
In Kafka's The Trial.

2952
03:06:22,887 --> 03:06:25,118
He's never given reasons for his arrest.

2953
03:06:25,307 --> 03:06:28,344
He doesn't know the unseen forces
ranging against him.

2954
03:06:28,977 --> 03:06:32,572
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippit.

2955
03:06:32,897 --> 03:06:34,649
No legal counsel was provided.

2956
03:06:34,815 --> 03:06:36,886
No record made of the questioning.

2957
03:06:37,151 --> 03:06:39,745
When the sun rises the next morning...

2958
03:06:39,986 --> 03:06:42,501
...he is booked for murdering the President.

2959
03:06:42,697 --> 03:06:46,486
The whole country, fueled by the media,
assumes he is guilty.

2960
03:06:47,243 --> 03:06:49,439
Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...

2961
03:06:49,621 --> 03:06:52,898
...out to spare Jackie Kennedy
from testifying at a trial...

2962
03:06:53,750 --> 03:06:56,139
...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...

2963
03:06:56,335 --> 03:06:59,134
...by one of his inside men
on the police force.

2964
03:07:00,130 --> 03:07:03,806
Oswald is brought out
like a sacrificial lamb...

2965
03:07:04,092 --> 03:07:07,130
...and nicely disposed of as an enemy
of the people.

2966
03:07:25,905 --> 03:07:27,782
Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...

2967
03:07:28,782 --> 03:07:31,536
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

2968
03:07:32,743 --> 03:07:33,699
Nobody.

2969
03:07:41,461 --> 03:07:46,013
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

2970
03:07:47,383 --> 03:07:50,501
The official legend is created
and the media takes it from there.

2971
03:07:52,179 --> 03:07:55,968
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

2972
03:07:56,224 --> 03:07:59,422
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

2973
03:08:00,854 --> 03:08:02,253
Hitler said:

2974
03:08:02,897 --> 03:08:06,015
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it."

2975
03:08:07,526 --> 03:08:10,917
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

2976
03:08:11,154 --> 03:08:15,512
...and got it by killing a President
was only the first in a long line of patsies.

2977
03:08:16,410 --> 03:08:19,244
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

2978
03:08:19,454 --> 03:08:22,015
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

2979
03:08:22,207 --> 03:08:25,644
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

2980
03:08:26,336 --> 03:08:29,135
...also killed by such lonely, crazed men.

2981
03:08:30,172 --> 03:08:34,291
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

2982
03:08:35,803 --> 03:08:39,956
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

2983
03:08:40,265 --> 03:08:42,734
...whose killers still possess the throne.

2984
03:08:43,060 --> 03:08:46,610
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

2985
03:08:46,854 --> 03:08:49,005
...at the heart of the American Dream.

2986
03:08:49,190 --> 03:08:53,469
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

2987
03:08:54,487 --> 03:08:56,682
What are our lives worth?

2988
03:08:56,865 --> 03:08:58,776
What is the future of a democracy...

2989
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:03,069
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

2990
03:09:03,328 --> 03:09:06,480
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

2991
03:09:07,749 --> 03:09:11,106
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

2992
03:09:11,503 --> 03:09:13,938
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

2993
03:09:14,130 --> 03:09:16,690
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

2994
03:09:16,966 --> 03:09:19,526
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

2995
03:09:21,304 --> 03:09:24,216
"Treason doth never prosper,"
wrote an English poet.

2996
03:09:25,016 --> 03:09:26,495
"What's the reason?

2997
03:09:27,267 --> 03:09:29,907
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason."

2998
03:09:30,646 --> 03:09:33,605
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

2999
03:09:34,274 --> 03:09:35,309
Why?

3000
03:09:35,858 --> 03:09:39,898
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

3001
03:09:40,154 --> 03:09:41,031
Why?

3002
03:09:42,115 --> 03:09:45,188
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

3003
03:09:45,410 --> 03:09:48,482
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

3004
03:09:49,622 --> 03:09:54,060
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

3005
03:09:54,335 --> 03:09:58,090
...the answer from on high
has always been: National security.

3006
03:09:59,339 --> 03:10:03,379
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

3007
03:10:04,051 --> 03:10:06,407
What national security
permits the removal...

3008
03:10:06,596 --> 03:10:08,986
...of fundamental power from the people...

3009
03:10:09,182 --> 03:10:12,937
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

3010
03:10:14,436 --> 03:10:16,347
That kind of national security is...

3011
03:10:16,521 --> 03:10:19,912
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

3012
03:10:20,692 --> 03:10:22,411
...you call it what it is:

3013
03:10:22,861 --> 03:10:24,089
Fascism!

3014
03:10:26,322 --> 03:10:31,158
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

3015
03:10:31,493 --> 03:10:33,052
...was a coup d'tat.

3016
03:10:33,871 --> 03:10:36,021
Its most direct and tragic result...

3017
03:10:36,373 --> 03:10:40,208
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

3018
03:10:41,712 --> 03:10:44,180
The war is the biggest business
in America...

3019
03:10:44,381 --> 03:10:46,452
...worth $80 billion a year.

3020
03:10:47,675 --> 03:10:50,349
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

3021
03:10:50,553 --> 03:10:53,352
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

3022
03:10:53,557 --> 03:10:56,994
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

3023
03:10:57,310 --> 03:11:00,666
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

3024
03:11:00,897 --> 03:11:03,411
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

3025
03:11:04,357 --> 03:11:07,430
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

3026
03:11:07,653 --> 03:11:10,532
...like-minded people in the Dallas Police...

3027
03:11:10,781 --> 03:11:13,899
...the Secret Service, the FBI,
and the White House...

3028
03:11:14,117 --> 03:11:17,827
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

3029
03:11:18,454 --> 03:11:20,763
...who were accomplices after the fact.

3030
03:11:21,457 --> 03:11:25,292
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

3031
03:11:26,170 --> 03:11:31,245
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

3032
03:11:32,008 --> 03:11:34,648
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

3033
03:11:34,844 --> 03:11:36,800
...for the military and their contractors.

3034
03:11:39,265 --> 03:11:41,302
Some people say I'm crazy.

3035
03:11:42,893 --> 03:11:45,727
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

3036
03:11:48,024 --> 03:11:50,903
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

3037
03:11:51,235 --> 03:11:54,069
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

3038
03:11:54,279 --> 03:11:58,034
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

3039
03:11:58,367 --> 03:12:02,884
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

3040
03:12:03,996 --> 03:12:05,635
Or the secret CIA memo...

3041
03:12:05,832 --> 03:12:10,065
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

3042
03:12:10,419 --> 03:12:12,137
These documents are yours.

3043
03:12:12,879 --> 03:12:15,155
The people's property. You pay for it.

3044
03:12:16,049 --> 03:12:18,200
But as the government sees you
as children...

3045
03:12:18,385 --> 03:12:21,458
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

3046
03:12:22,264 --> 03:12:24,904
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

3047
03:12:25,975 --> 03:12:29,013
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

3048
03:12:30,188 --> 03:12:31,780
I'm in my 40s...

3049
03:12:33,065 --> 03:12:35,784
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

3050
03:12:35,985 --> 03:12:40,298
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

3051
03:12:41,365 --> 03:12:45,120
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

3052
03:12:45,411 --> 03:12:50,361
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

3053
03:12:51,957 --> 03:12:53,789
They may push it back then.

3054
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:58,716
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

3055
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:03,095
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

3056
03:13:04,345 --> 03:13:05,415
We better.

3057
03:13:06,597 --> 03:13:10,273
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

3058
03:13:10,725 --> 03:13:14,878
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

3059
03:13:15,271 --> 03:13:16,910
Just a bit farther out West.

3060
03:13:18,817 --> 03:13:20,694
An American naturalist wrote:

3061
03:13:21,111 --> 03:13:24,183
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

3062
03:13:24,571 --> 03:13:26,403
"...against its government."

3063
03:13:28,117 --> 03:13:30,234
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

3064
03:13:30,994 --> 03:13:35,034
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

3065
03:13:36,832 --> 03:13:39,142
Going back to when we were children...

3066
03:13:39,961 --> 03:13:44,513
...I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

3067
03:13:45,925 --> 03:13:47,881
That virtue was its own reward.

3068
03:13:48,052 --> 03:13:49,964
That good triumphs over evil.

3069
03:13:51,221 --> 03:13:53,941
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

3070
03:13:55,017 --> 03:13:59,011
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

3071
03:14:00,646 --> 03:14:03,605
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

3072
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:07,621
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

3073
03:14:07,986 --> 03:14:09,818
People like S.M. Holland...

3074
03:14:10,489 --> 03:14:11,808
...Lee Bowers...

3075
03:14:12,366 --> 03:14:14,005
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

3076
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:17,312
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

3077
03:14:17,621 --> 03:14:20,499
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

3078
03:14:21,583 --> 03:14:23,733
...sent from all over the country.

3079
03:14:24,210 --> 03:14:26,771
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

3080
03:14:27,547 --> 03:14:30,267
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

3081
03:14:31,592 --> 03:14:34,665
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

3082
03:14:35,929 --> 03:14:37,682
People who drive cabs...

3083
03:14:38,307 --> 03:14:39,865
...who nurse in hospitals...

3084
03:14:40,017 --> 03:14:42,532
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

3085
03:14:43,811 --> 03:14:44,846
Why?

3086
03:14:46,439 --> 03:14:47,872
Because they care.

3087
03:14:48,857 --> 03:14:51,008
Because they want to know the truth.

3088
03:14:51,653 --> 03:14:53,690
Because they want their country back.

3089
03:14:53,864 --> 03:14:55,934
Because it still belongs to us...

3090
03:14:56,365 --> 03:15:00,279
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

3091
03:15:02,788 --> 03:15:06,941
The truth is the most important value
we have, because if it doesn't endure...

3092
03:15:07,875 --> 03:15:09,707
...if the government murders truth...

3093
03:15:09,878 --> 03:15:12,073
...if we cannot respect these people...

3094
03:15:12,255 --> 03:15:17,092
...then this is not the country I was born in,
or the country I want to die in.

3095
03:15:19,178 --> 03:15:20,406
Tennyson wrote:

"Authority forgets a dying king."

3097
03:15:24,474 --> 03:15:26,989
This was never more true
than for John F. Kennedy...

3098
03:15:27,186 --> 03:15:30,657
...whose murder was probably one
of the most terrible moments...

3099
03:15:31,106 --> 03:15:33,177
...in the history of our country.

3100
03:15:35,777 --> 03:15:39,612
We, the people, the jury system sitting
in judgment on Clay Shaw...

3101
03:15:41,617 --> 03:15:43,255
...represent the hope...

3102
03:15:43,409 --> 03:15:45,799
...of humanity against government power.

3103
03:15:47,246 --> 03:15:48,999
In discharging your duty...

3104
03:15:49,790 --> 03:15:52,907
...to bring a first conviction
in this house of cards...

3105
03:15:53,419 --> 03:15:55,057
...against Clay Shaw...

3106
03:15:55,713 --> 03:16:00,151
"...ask not what your country can do for
you but what you can do for your country."

3107
03:16:00,925 --> 03:16:02,359
Do not forget...

3108
03:16:03,095 --> 03:16:04,813
...your dying king.

3109
03:16:06,431 --> 03:16:07,944
Show this world...

3110
03:16:08,474 --> 03:16:13,106
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people."

3111
03:16:15,939 --> 03:16:17,817
Nothing as long as you live...

3112
03:16:17,983 --> 03:16:19,939
...will ever be more important.

3113
03:16:23,196 --> 03:16:24,515
It's up to you.

3114
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:49,831
Has the jury reached a verdict?

3115
03:16:50,472 --> 03:16:51,666
We have, Your Honor.

3116
03:16:51,806 --> 03:16:54,116
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

3117
03:17:03,817 --> 03:17:06,093
Will the defendant please rise?

3118
03:17:10,324 --> 03:17:12,474
The clerk will now read the verdict.

3119
03:17:13,327 --> 03:17:17,003
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969.

3120
03:17:17,997 --> 03:17:22,628
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty."

3121
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:46,153
We believe there was a conspiracy.

3122
03:17:46,315 --> 03:17:49,194
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

3123
03:17:49,402 --> 03:17:50,801
There's Jim!

3124
03:17:53,406 --> 03:17:58,162
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

3125
03:18:00,120 --> 03:18:03,113
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

3126
03:18:03,498 --> 03:18:07,936
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

3127
03:18:08,210 --> 03:18:11,442
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

3128
03:18:11,881 --> 03:18:14,112
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

3129
03:18:14,300 --> 03:18:15,699
Are you going to resign?

3130
03:18:15,842 --> 03:18:19,313
Hell, no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

3131
03:18:19,930 --> 03:18:21,762
Who will you persecute next?

3132
03:18:21,932 --> 03:18:24,890
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

3133
03:18:25,102 --> 03:18:27,457
...then I will continue for 30 years!

3134
03:18:28,604 --> 03:18:31,403
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

3135
03:18:31,607 --> 03:18:33,838
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

3136
03:18:34,485 --> 03:18:37,876
- How does it feel to be acquitted?
- It's been exhausting.

3137
03:18:38,114 --> 03:18:39,229
What'll you do now?

3138
03:18:39,364 --> 03:18:41,037
I'm going home and cook some touffe.

3139
03:18:41,200 --> 03:18:42,519
Were you confident about the outcome?

3140
03:18:45,871 --> 03:18:49,262
- Do you think Garrison will be back?
- I'm sure he will.
