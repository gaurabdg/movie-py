1
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?</i>

2
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,292
<i>Then I'll begin.</i>

3
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>"This story started many
thousands of years ago...</i>

4
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,750
<i>but it was all over in just 7 days.</i>

5
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,917
<i>All that long, long time ago,
none of the things we can see now...</i>

6
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>the sun, the moon, the stars,
the earth, the animals and plants...</i>

7
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:00,917
<i>none existed. Only God existed...</i>

8
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,625
<i>and so only He could
have created them.</i>

9
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,542
<i>And He did."</i>

10
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:19,750
Mr. Simpson, what a character he was!
I wonder whatever became of him?

11
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,958
I imagine he's dead,
Like all the rest.

12
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,542
Those were the days...

13
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,208
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!

14
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:49,083
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the...

15
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,208
Oh yes, of course.

16
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,500
Come in.

17
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,583
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

18
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,042
- You are...?
- I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am...

19
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,708
...and this is Edmund Tuttle.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

20
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:16,833
- You must be the gardener.
- Ay, that's right, the gardener...

21
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,833
and this young lady's called Lydia.

22
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:26,417
- Have you had experience in service?
- Don't let that angel face fool you.

23
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:30,667
- She's older than she looks.
- Can you iron?

24
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,792
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

25
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:41,042
Ah, she can't talk, ma'am.
The poor little mite's a mute.

26
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,417
But she's a good little worker,
I can promise you that.

27
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,292
All right.

28
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,917
All right. The other girl I had
spoke too much anyway. Follow me.

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,792
Mrs. Mills, you and the Girl will
sleep in the attic room upstairs...

30
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,667
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

31
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,250
Tuttle. You can sleep in the shed,
around the back.

32
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,542
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

33
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,042
since the servants disappeared,
almost a week ago.

34
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,542
You mean they just vanished?

35
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:17,042
Into thin air. No notice, nothing.
They didn't even collect their wages.

36
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,125
- They... they just left us.
- What a strange thing to do!

37
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:27,208
You'll find out sometimes this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

38
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:33,208
Hence my advertisement in the paper
for honest, hardworking people.

39
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,917
Nobody's more honest
and hardworking than us.

40
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,667
- Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?
- Ay, we're very honest.

41
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,208
And... very hardworking.

42
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,667
The kitchen.

43
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,083
I have breakfast at eight,
the children at nine.

44
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,500
Lunch will be served at one
and dinner at half past seven.

45
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,708
And the master, ma'am?

46
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,792
The master went off to war,
a year and a half ago.

47
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,000
I had no news since the war ended.

48
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,167
- Which of you does the cooking?
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

49
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,792
Which of you does the cooking?

50
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,167
Have you all noticed
what I am doing?

51
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:22,625
No door must be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

52
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,167
It's vital that you remember this.

53
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,125
It's not as easy as it may seem.

54
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,250
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 5O doors...

55
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,208
depending on which area of the house
you're in at the time.

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,625
Mrs. Mills, tomorrow I'll leave
a set of keys in your charge.

57
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,125
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,625
The music room. That old piano
was already here when we moved in.

59
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,083
Please do not let the Children
thump away on it.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,708
It sets off my migraine.

61
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:54,792
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

62
00:06:55,542 --> 00:07:00,208
So we have no telephone, radio
or anything that makes a racket.

63
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,708
We don't have electricity either.

64
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,750
The Germans kept cutting it off,
so we learned to live without it.

65
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,000
- Let's continue.
- Ma'am, there's really no need...

66
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,667
...to show us around the whole house.
- Yes!

67
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,292
Yes, there is.

68
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,333
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

69
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:21,708
It's hard to see if there is a table,
a chair, a door, a sideboard...

70
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,625
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

71
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,125
What do you mean, ma'am?

72
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,875
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

73
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,250
Mr. Tuttle, see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

74
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,917
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,125
You two can start closing
the curtains. All of them.

76
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,958
Come.

77
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,458
I'll wake them. You wait here.

78
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,083
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

79
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,083
Wakey-wakey!

80
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:49,042
Now, come on.
Eyes closed, hands together.

81
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,458
Blessed be, at light of day,
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

82
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,000
Blessed be the Virgin pure
Whom I greet with faith so sure.

83
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,833
Jesus, Mary, Spotless Rose,
Keep us till this day doth close.

84
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,375
They're still half-asleep.

85
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,250
What sweet little children!

86
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,083
Well? What do you say?

87
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,583
How do you do?

88
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,917
How do you do?

89
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,583
How do you do, children?

90
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:31,625
My name's Mrs. Mills, but you
can call me Bertha if you like.

91
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,833
What are your names?

92
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,833
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

93
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,583
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names!

94
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,583
Are you going to be our new nanny?

95
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,750
- Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.
- It's time for their breakfast.

96
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,000
Lydia, you go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

97
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,292
- The doctors couldn't find a cure.
- For what?

98
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,375
Their condition.

99
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,292
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

100
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:17,417
They're photosensitive and mustn't
be exposed to more light than this.

101
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,292
Or, in a matter of minutes, they'd
break out in sores and blisters...

102
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,708
and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.

103
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,458
Good Heavens!

104
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,417
- I don't like this toast.
- Why not?

105
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,417
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.

106
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,750
Well, that was because
before, somebody else made it.

107
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,750
When are they coming back?

108
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,583
They won't be coming back, child.

109
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,833
Just like daddy.

110
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,417
Daddy is coming back, though.

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,667
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting
in a war in France, you know.

112
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,792
- It's the World War.
- I know, but he's in France.

113
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,417
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

114
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,292
Are you going to leave us, too?

115
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:14,083
Of course not.
Why should I leave you?

116
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:18,708
The others said they wouldn't.
But they did. And then it happened.

117
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,208
Be quiet!

118
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,917
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

119
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,083
Mummy went mad.

120
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,750
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

121
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,750
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

122
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,917
Be quiet!

123
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,625
What's going on?

124
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,292
I want to see those plates empty in
less than a minute. Is that clear?

125
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,917
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside
a moment, I'd like a word with you.

126
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,542
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,000
The postman usually comes
every Wednesday...

128
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:07,208
but I've just checked the letter box
and this week he hasn't.

129
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,833
- I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.
- This letter should've been collected...

130
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,167
and delivered to the
newspaper five days ago.

131
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,875
It's the advertisement.
Since it wasn't published...

132
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,500
...how are you here?
- Now I understand.

133
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:27,500
That's exactly what I was going to
say when you opened the door to us.

134
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:32,500
The truth is that we just
come by on the off-chance.

135
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,667
A big house like this always needs
someone who knows the ropes.

136
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,458
You mean you've served
in a house like this one before?

137
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,250
This may come as a
surprise to you, but...

138
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,083
we, in fact, used to work here.

139
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,542
- Here?
- It was a few years ago.

140
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,750
And if you don't mind my saying so,
they were the best years of my life.

141
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:05,208
That's why we come by, because
this house means a lot to us.

142
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,333
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

143
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:13,375
Don't bother, there's no need.
So you know the house well?

144
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,708
Like the back of my hand.

145
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:21,042
If the walls haven't sprouted legs
and moved in the meantime.

146
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,125
The only thing that moves here
is the light.

147
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,375
But it changes everything.

148
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,083
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

149
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,833
One might almost say...

150
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,750
unbearable.

151
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,250
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,708
- Yes, ma'am.
- I don't like fantasies.

153
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,458
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

154
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,333
- I think so, ma'am.
- My children have strange ideas.

155
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,167
But you mustn't pay any attention
to them. Children will be children.

156
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,083
Yes, of course, ma'am.

157
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,708
All right...

158
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,500
you can stay.

159
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,417
Thank you very much, ma'am.

160
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,875
It did happened.

161
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,542
"The Roman governor tried to make
them change their minds afterwards...

162
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:49,667
"To make them change
their minds", full stop.

163
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,917
- "Afterwards..."
- "Afterwards...

164
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:57,208
he ordered them to be beaten.
But Justus and Pastor, not afraid...

165
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:00,625
rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

166
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,708
When he saw this, the Roman
governor was filled with rage...

167
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,500
and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

168
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,583
What do you find so amusing?

169
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,167
Well...

170
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,708
- well, what?
- Those children were really stupid.

171
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,875
- Why?
- They said they believed...

172
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,833
in Jesus and then
they got killed for it.

173
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,125
- And would you deny Christ?
- Well, yes.

174
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:36,000
Inside I would have believed in him.
But I wouldn't have told the Romans.

175
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,375
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?

176
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,333
I see.

177
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,583
So you both Would have lied,
to the point of denying Christ.

178
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:54,250
You'd have saved your heads from
being chopped off, that's true...

179
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,875
...but what would've happened after?
- When?

180
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,750
In the next life, after we die.
Where would you have gone?

181
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,958
- Where, Nicholas?
- To the children's limbo.

182
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,833
What is the children's limbo?

183
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,792
- One of the four Hells.
- Which are...?

184
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:22,125
- Me! Me!
- No, let him answer. Which are?

185
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:27,667
There's the hell where the damned
go, then there's Purgatory...

186
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,958
and the Bosom of Abraham,
where the Just go...

187
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,250
...and limbo where children go.
- At the centre of the Earth.

188
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,625
Where it's very, very hot.

189
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:40,625
That's where children go who tell
lies. But not for a few days, oh no.

190
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,875
No, they're damned, forever.

191
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,833
Think about it.

192
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,500
Try to imagine the end of Eternity.

193
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:58,667
Close your eyes, close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

194
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Forever...

195
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,167
Pain. Forever.

196
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,792
I'm getting dizzy.

197
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,208
Now do you understand why
Justus and Pastor told the truth?

198
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,417
Right.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,250
- Open your readers at lesson 6.
- Can't we go and play?

200
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,667
You most certainly cannot. First
you're going to read the lesson...

201
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,250
...and then learn it, by heart.
- All of it?

202
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,833
Anne, any more protests and
there'll be no playing at all today.

203
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,833
In fact, I think you can study
in separate rooms...

204
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,208
- But we get scared if we're separated!
- You get scared?

205
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,417
As if you weren't used
to this house by now.

206
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,333
What if we see a ghost?

207
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:54,125
- Has your sister been telling stories?
- I haven't told him anything.

208
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,042
If you see a ghost, you say hello
and you continue on studying.

209
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,583
- Come with me to the music room.
- Why me?

210
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:03,125
Because I say so!
Now come on, take your book.

211
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,750
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson
learned in less than an hour.

212
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,208
- Mummy?
- What?

213
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:14,208
- Give me a kiss.
- "Give me a kiss, give me a kiss..."

214
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:18,833
- Anne, wait for me outside.
- You know I can't.

215
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,875
Over there.

216
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,458
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

217
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,875
My daughter is going to cross
the living room.

218
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,917
All right, Anne.

220
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:49,500
Darling, mummy can't be with you
all the time.

221
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,125
You must learn to be on your own.

222
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,542
Where's your rosary?

223
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,875
Whenever you feel afraid...

224
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:09,375
I want you to squeeze it with all
your might and say an Our Father.

225
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,875
And then your fear will go away.

226
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,167
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

227
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't you see that when you do that,
the Lord is with you?

228
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,958
There's no reason to be afraid.

229
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,000
"The house and the family.

230
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,667
We all live in a house
with our family.

231
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:14,333
It is usually made up of parents,
children, and their grandparents.

232
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,417
We must be obedient and kind...

233
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,042
towards the other members
of our family.

234
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,333
And we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters."

235
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,208
- Do you have any children?
- No.

236
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,708
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got.

237
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,208
- And I'm all they've got.
- Was she born like that?

238
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,833
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

239
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,125
The girl, was she born a mute?

240
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,500
No.

241
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

242
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:52,292
If you'll excuse me, I'll go and see
if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

243
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,875
Nicholas!

244
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,583
Nicholas, I'm coming!

245
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,250
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

246
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,792
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

247
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,083
But I just heard you...
Anne! Anne!

248
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,458
Anne!

249
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,250
Anne!

250
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,542
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

251
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,375
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

252
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,833
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

253
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,833
But I just heard you a moment ago.

254
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,875
There's no need to feel
ashamed, darling.

255
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,417
I don't. If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.

256
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,917
- Really? So I imagined it, did I?
- No. It was that boy.

257
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,667
- What boy?
- Victor.

258
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,125
Who's Victor?

259
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,458
The boy who was here a moment ago.

260
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,833
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

261
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,542
I think he's a spoilt brat.

262
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:41,292
He said we had to leave the house.

263
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,583
Did he now? Why was he crying?

264
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,083
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

265
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,958
- His father's a pianist and...
- His father's a pianist, is he?

266
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,208
Yes. And I've already told him
he's not allowed to touch the piano.

267
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,000
He isn't, is he, mummy?

268
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:00,542
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

269
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,875
No, only with Victor. His father
is with the others in the hall.

270
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,333
But I've just come from the hall,
there's no one there.

271
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,500
They must have gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

272
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,500
That'll do, Anne. That's enough.

273
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,292
- Now, why were you crying?
- It was Victor.

274
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,625
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there.

275
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:24,917
Can you tell me how a boy can get
in and out of this room if it's locked?

276
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,625
I thought I made myself
quite clear:

277
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,417
No door is to be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

278
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,208
Is that so hard to understand?

279
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,833
This house is like a ship. The light
must be hold as if it were water...

280
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,708
by opening and closing the doors.

281
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,875
- My children's lives are at stake!
- But, ma'am, I...

282
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,333
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

283
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:55,333
Now which was the last of you
to enter that room? Lydia?

284
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,583
She hasn't got a key,
I already told you that.

285
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:04,208
- Well, that leaves you, then.
- But I was in the hall all the time.

286
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,667
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.

287
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,583
I hope you are not suggesting
that was me!

288
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,542
Do you think that I would endanger
the life of my own daughter?

289
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,667
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

290
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:29,167
Oh really? And who is going
to tell mummy? You?

291
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,750
Or perhaps you?

292
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,708
Did you really see a boy?

293
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,542
Yes, he's called Victor.

294
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,750
- Is he a ghost?
- Don't be stupid.

295
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,875
- Ghosts aren't like that.
- What are they like?

296
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:59,000
I've told you, they go about
in white sheets and carry chains.

297
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,792
- How do you know?
- I've seen them.

298
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,333
They come out at night.

299
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,417
Fibber! Where?

300
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,833
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

301
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,417
- I don't believe you saw that boy.
- Believe what you like.

302
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:22,417
You'll soon beg us to Play with you.

303
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,542
Nicholas. Nicholas.

304
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,417
What?

305
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,042
Look.

306
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,833
Why have you opened the curtains?

307
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,917
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it then?

308
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,792
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

309
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,583
- Liar. I'm going to Tell mummy.
- So I'm a liar, am I?

310
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:01,833
Victor, come out from behind that
curtain so my brother can see you.

311
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,833
- Leave me alone.
- You don't want to see him now?

312
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:18,250
You're a cowardly custard!
Cowardly, Cowardly custard!

313
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,500
Cowardly, Cowardly custard!

314
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,917
I'll just have to do it Myself,
then.

315
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,792
That's enough, Victor!

316
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:51,375
Nicholas. Tell him to leave the
curtains alone. He won't listen.

317
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,583
Stop it! Get off my bed,
both of you!

318
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:57,250
- This is our bed.
- No, it's mine.

319
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,417
Anne, please stop putting on
that voice.

320
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,000
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

321
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:08,000
If you don't stop, I'll call my
mother and she'll kick you out.

322
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:11,875
- You don't know my mother!
- And you don't know my parents.

323
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,792
Anne, I'm going to tell mummy
about you.

324
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,625
Don't be stupid!
Can't you see it's not me?

325
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,583
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

326
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,042
Help! Mummy!

327
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,458
- Help! Mummy!
- What is it? What is it?

328
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,083
- What is it?
- She was frightening me...

329
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:48,792
...and I told her to be quiet and...
- I'm fed up! Do you hear me?

330
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,167
- I am fed up with you!
- I didn't do anything!

331
00:27:55,708 --> 00:28:00,625
"Therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden...

332
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,292
to till the ground from whence
he was taken.

333
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,167
So he drove out the man:

334
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:08,625
And placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubim's...

335
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:13,500
and a flaming sword to keep
the way of the tree of life."

336
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,333
There! I've finished.

337
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,917
Very good.

338
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,958
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

339
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,375
What? That's not what we agreed.

340
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,375
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

341
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,000
Today you'll being punished.
You'll do as I say.

342
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,458
You can't make me ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

343
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,125
- How dare you?
- Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness...

344
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,792
for something I didn't do.

345
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,333
You told your brother that
there was someone else in the room!

346
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,792
- There was!
- You're lying!

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,750
I am not.

348
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:51,042
Anne, do you remember
the story about Justus and Pastor?

349
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,458
Children who don't tell the truth
end up in limbo.

350
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:57,417
That's what you say.
But I read the other day...

351
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,583
that limbo is only for children
who haven't been baptized.

352
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,667
And I have.

353
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,958
"And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering...

354
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,792
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.

355
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,042
And he took the fire in his hand...

356
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:17,167
and a knife; and they went
both of them together.

357
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,792
And Isaac speak unto Abraham
his father, and said...

358
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,167
My father: And he said,
Here am I, my son. And he..."

359
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,125
- Did you look in on Nicholas?
- Yes ma'am.

360
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,708
The little angel is fast asleep.

361
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,500
- And Anne? Still on the stairs?
- Oh yes, ma'am.

362
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:58,583
I'd prefer to see her, but I can't
embroider in such poor light.

363
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,583
How long is this punishment going
to go on? It's been three days now.

364
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,792
It's up to her.

365
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:13,167
She's got to learn to swallow
her pride and ask for forgiveness.

366
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,500
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

367
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:22,875
- The priest will be very pleased.
- Lf he ever pay us another visit.

368
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,292
He knows perfectly well
the children can't go out.

369
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,083
He told me yesterday he'd be by,
as soon as possible.

370
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,125
I'm beginning to feel totally
cut off from the world.

371
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:38,042
And this fog doesn't exactly help.
It's never lasted this long before.

372
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,125
That's true, ma'am.

373
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,958
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

374
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,208
Anne! Anne, I can't hear you!

375
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,167
Incidentally, I've had to put up with
the noise of Lydia running around...

376
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,792
above my head.
Hurtling backwards and forwards...

377
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,875
as if there were three people!

378
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:07,417
Tell her no to kick up quite such a
rumpus just to do a little cleaning.

379
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:12,208
- I couldn't bare a migraine attack.
- I'll tell her, ma'am.

380
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,708
Thank you.

381
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,167
Now she's really gone too far.

382
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,208
Lydia! Lydia!

383
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:29,250
"...in the mount of the Lord
it shall be seen.

384
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,042
- And the Angel of the Lord..."
- What's going on up there?

385
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,167
Nothing, mummy.
I'm just reading, Like you told me.

386
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,125
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

387
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:48,667
"And the Angel called unto Abraham
the second time, and said:

388
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,708
'By myself have I sworn,
saith the Lord'..."

389
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,208
- What was that?
- I don't know.

390
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,667
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise?

391
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,250
- I can't tell you, mummy.
- You tell me!

392
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,292
I told you there was someone
in the room and you punished me!

393
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,833
- Now I don't know what to say!
- Anne, I want the truth!

394
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,375
Tell me if there is someone
upstairs.

395
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,292
There. In that junk room.

396
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,958
Mummy, you're letting the light in!

397
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:17,000
She's here, she's here.

398
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,042
Mummy, she says she's here.

399
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,458
She's watching us.
She's watching us!

400
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,917
- Where did they go?
- They passed here. Didn't you see?

401
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,583
Which way did they go?

402
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,875
Over there, over there.
And down there, as well.

403
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,458
They're everywhere.
They say the house is theirs.

404
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:08,333
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

405
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,958
- Ma'am, stay calm please.
- I will not stay calm!

406
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,375
For five years I managed to avoid
a single Nazi entering this house!

407
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,125
And now there is someone here,
opening and closing the doors!

408
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,708
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

409
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,250
The floorboards squeak,
and the plumbing clanks and...

410
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,208
There were voices, I'm telling you.

411
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,500
- Mummy, look.
- A boy and two women...

412
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,958
...they were talking together.
- Mummy, look.

413
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,458
I did it yesterday.

414
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:41,792
This is the father, the mother,
Victor and this is the old woman.

415
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,167
- What do these numbers stand for?
- The number of times I've seen them.

416
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,667
I see the old woman the most.

417
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,917
God in Heaven!

418
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:59,708
Call Mr. Tuttle. We have to search
the whole house before it gets dark.

419
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,292
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,667
- Mummy!
- Yes, darling. It's all right.

421
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,167
Nothing's going to happen to you
while mummy's here.

422
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,875
Look mummy, she really scares me.

423
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,750
It's as if she's not looking at you,
but she can see you.

424
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:15,958
And she's always around,
saying: "Come with me".

425
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,583
- Anne, don't lie to me!
- Honestly, mummy.

426
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:22,500
And she asks me things.
Victor told me she's a witch.

427
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,667
- What does she ask you?
- Things.

428
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,458
Her breath smells.

429
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,792
We have to open all the curtains.

430
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,917
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

431
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,583
You both search the right side
and I'll take the left.

432
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,625
Then we'll search upstairs.

433
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:58,542
Perhaps they are ghosts who lived
in this house before and who...

434
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,042
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

435
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,708
Ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go...

436
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:09,292
Anne, why do you make up
such stories?

437
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,542
I don't. I read them in books.

438
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,750
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything that you read in books.

439
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,583
That's what our mother says.

440
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,708
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

441
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:23,833
And then she expects us to believe
everything written in the Bible.

442
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,917
- And don't you believe it?
- I believe some things.

443
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,792
But, for example, I don't believe
God made the world in seven days.

444
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,167
And I don't believe that Noah
got all those animals into one boat.

445
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,500
Or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

446
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:42,292
- No, I don't believe that either.
- Doves are anything but holy.

447
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,250
They pooh on our windows.

448
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:54,458
Have you mentioned any
of this to your mother?

449
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,417
Ma'am?

450
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,875
They've searched everywhere.
There's no one.

451
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,958
I see.

452
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,958
Mrs. Mills?

453
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,083
Yes, ma'am?

454
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,750
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

455
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:24,000
- It is a photograph album, ma'am.
- No, they're all asleep.

456
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,667
Look.

457
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,708
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

458
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,917
It's a book of the dead.

459
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,542
In the last century, they used
to take photographs of the dead...

460
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,833
in the hopes that their souls would
go on living through the portraits.

461
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,542
There are even group portraits.

462
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,208
And children!

463
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,708
It's macabre.

464
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,833
How could these people
be so superstitious?

465
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:02,375
Grief over the death can lead
people to do the strangest things.

466
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,375
- Get rid of it. I don't want it here.
- Yes, ma'am.

467
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,042
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Come and sit by the fire.

468
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,708
Thank you very much, ma'am.

469
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,583
So, tell me about when
you worked here before.

470
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:46,875
Did you have to look after
children then as well?

471
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:51,917
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

472
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:57,208
- Were there many servants?
- About 15.

473
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:02,417
- In the end there were just us 3.
- Why?

474
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,583
My employers moved to London.

475
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:11,208
They came here less and less,
it being so out of the way.

476
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:15,917
And so gradually the house
just became empty.

477
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:19,917
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

478
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:26,458
My family left in the summer
of 194O, just before the invasion.

479
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,958
That was the last time
I ever heard of them.

480
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,708
I don't blame them.

481
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,875
Actually, we left, too.

482
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,917
Although sometimes
when you leave a place...

483
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:49,458
it's like it's there with you,
all the time.

484
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,792
I always felt like
I never left this house.

485
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,917
Why did you leave?

486
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:59,917
Because of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.

487
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
- Was that when Lydia went dumb?
- Yes, I think so.

488
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:12,583
Though, you know, my memory
is a bit rusty these days.

489
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,333
What happened to her?

490
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:26,667
Well suddenly, one day,
she just stopped talking.

491
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,250
There must have been a reason.

492
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,208
People don't just stop talking.

493
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:36,333
These things are always the result
of some sort of trauma.

494
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:39,458
Something must have
happened to her.

495
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,250
Did your employers treat you well?

496
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:50,250
They were always very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.

497
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,292
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

498
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,417
I'll never be able to get up
in the morning.

499
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,167
Off you go.

500
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,708
I'm going to stay here
awhile longer.

501
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,583
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:41,542
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

503
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,708
Can you forgive me?

504
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,833
Anne.

505
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,833
- Mummy.
- What?

506
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,333
When's daddy coming home?

507
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:26,833
- When the war's over.
- Why did he go to war?

508
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:30,667
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

509
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,667
Daddy went...

510
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:39,542
Daddy went because he's very brave.

511
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:45,750
And because he wasn't prepared
to obey the Germans.

512
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,208
Why?

513
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:58,542
Charles...

514
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,750
where are you?

515
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,958
Mrs. Mills!

516
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,750
Mrs. Mills!

517
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,292
What's the matter, ma'am?

518
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,292
The key to the music room!
Give it to me! Quickly!

519
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,833
- What's happening?
- Come on!

520
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,458
My God!

521
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,042
I checked that room myself.

522
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,833
It was empty.

523
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,583
- Now take these tablets.
- And yet...

524
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:29,417
- They'll do you good.
...there was someone else there.

525
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,250
And it wasn't human.

526
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:37,583
There is something in this house.

527
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:40,958
- Something diabolic.
- Ma'am!

528
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,792
Something which is not...

529
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,250
not at rest.

530
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:56,875
I know you don't believe it.
You don't believe it, do you?

531
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:02,667
No, I don't blame you.
I used to not believe these things.

532
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:06,500
I do believe it, ma'am.

533
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:14,708
I've always believed in those things.
They're not easy to explain...

534
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,500
but they do happen.

535
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:21,125
We've all heard stories
of the beyond...

536
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,750
now and then.

537
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:27,125
And I think that, sometimes...

538
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,250
the world...

539
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,375
of the dead gets mixed up...

540
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,417
with the world of the living.

541
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:40,625
But it's impossible! The Lord would
never allow such an aberration!

542
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,333
The living and the dead will only
meet at the end of Eternity.

543
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:50,125
- It says so in the Bible.
- Ma'am...

544
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:55,208
there isn't always an answer
for everything.

545
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,375
Where are you off to, ma'am?

546
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:12,208
I'm going to the village
to pay Father legend a visit.

547
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:15,333
If he won't come here, then I Shall
go to him. And I'll bring him back.

548
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,917
- Wait till the weather improves!
- I've waited long enough.

549
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:23,958
- Ma'am, the priest told me...
- I don't care what he told you!

550
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:27,917
I want him to tell me, personally.
He must come today.

551
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,542
- What are you going to tell him?
- We have searched the whole house...

552
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,667
and now I need it to be blessed.

553
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:41,333
- Please wait, it's still very early!
- Mr. Tuttle?

554
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,708
Good morning.

555
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:46,250
- Search the garden for gravestones.
- Gravestones?

556
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,792
Yes, when we bought this house, they
said there was a little cemetery.

557
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,292
I think it was somewhere
over there, amongst the trees.

558
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,042
- I've not seen anything.
- Check carefully.

559
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:57,208
They could be overgrown.

560
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:00,375
I need to know if there was
a family buried here.

561
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:03,250
And if they had a little boy,
Victor.

562
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:21,583
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

563
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:24,542
Do you think it's safe
to let her go?

564
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,583
Don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

565
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,750
Yes, the fog. The fog, of course.

566
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:36,833
And when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

567
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:41,542
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.
All in good time.

568
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,083
Speaking of which...

569
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,333
Charles?

570
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,958
Grace.

571
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:58,833
You're here! You're here!

572
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,458
They said there was no hope.

573
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,750
They said I should
give you up for dead!

574
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:07,500
They say a lot of things.

575
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:14,375
Thank you.

576
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,667
Thank you, God. Thank you.

577
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,708
Every night I've prayed for this...

578
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:23,667
begging God to bring you back.

579
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,500
To bring the children
their father back.

580
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,625
But where have you been
all this time?

581
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:39,042
Out there, looking for my home.

582
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:49,375
You're so different.

583
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,625
So different...

584
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,625
Sometimes I bleed.

585
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,375
Ma'am.

586
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,250
Mrs. Mills...

587
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,875
this is my husband.

588
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:48,583
- I'm very Pleased to meet you, Sir.
- He's very weak.

589
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:55,625
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes...

590
00:57:56,667 --> 00:58:00,083
...and something to eat.
- Right away, ma'am.

591
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,958
How are my little ones?

592
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,333
Daddy!

593
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,708
Why did you take so long?

594
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:38,500
Hello, Nicholas.

595
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:41,500
I told you, you see!
I told you he'd come back.

596
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,167
- Have you both been well behaved?
- We've been very good.

597
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,708
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

598
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,500
We study everyday
for our First Communion.

599
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:00,958
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

600
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,708
Here he comes.

601
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:16,208
Darling, we've prepared
lunch for you.

602
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,792
Are you coming down
or would you prefer that...?

603
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,833
- When's daddy coming down?
- Be patient, Anne.

604
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:36,875
Daddy is not well.

605
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,542
He said he's seen lots of dead men.

606
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,667
Mummy, when people die in the war,
where do they go?

607
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,500
What a question! It depends.

608
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,417
- On what?
- Well...

609
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:57,625
on whether they fought on the side
of the "goodies" or the "baddies".

610
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:01,708
Your father, for example,
fought for England, the "goodies".

611
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,583
How do you know who the "goodies"
and the "baddies" are?

612
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:10,917
That's enough questions. Eat your
food. You'll never go to war.

613
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,083
We'll never go anywhere.

614
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,542
You're not missing anything.

615
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:23,042
You're better at home with mummy
and daddy, who I've you very much.

616
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,333
And the intruders.

617
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,583
There are no intruders here.

618
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,750
But you said that there were.

619
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:36,125
I said there are no intruders here.
And I don't want to hear about it.

620
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,875
- But you said...
- No, that is enough!

621
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,708
- Can I say something?
- No!

622
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:45,042
- Why not?
- Because... because you can't!

623
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,417
Anne, stop breathing like that.

624
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:57,875
You heard me. Stop it!

625
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,708
Stop breathing!

626
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,667
Right, you go to your room.

627
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:09,583
Go to your room.
There's no dessert for you today.

628
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:18,917
No crying now. No crying.

629
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,292
Stop that. Here.

630
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,042
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry!

631
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,708
- I don't care!
- There, there.

632
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,917
You listen to me.

633
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,750
I've seen them, too.

634
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,708
You have?

635
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:41,208
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

636
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:44,750
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

637
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,792
She only believes
in what she was taught.

638
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,667
But don't worry.
Sooner or later...

639
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,708
she'll see them.

640
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:58,542
- And everything will be different.
- How?

641
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:05,917
You'll see. There are going
to be some big surprises.

642
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,542
There are going to be... changes.

643
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,917
Changes?

644
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:27,625
Now she is behaving
as if nothing had happened.

645
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:33,083
- What about her daughter?
- She's not so stubborn.

646
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,875
The children will be easier
to convince.

647
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:40,292
No, it's the mother who is going
to cause us problems.

648
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:44,833
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

649
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:50,500
No, I don't think he even knows
where he is.

650
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:09,083
Look what a pretty daughter
I've got.

651
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:14,458
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

652
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,292
I look like a bride.

653
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,917
Yes, you do.

654
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,625
Now I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

655
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,042
You can take it off now.

656
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,750
- This dress has to be spotless.
- I promise I won't dirty it.

657
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:40,417
- Let me wear it just a little.
- "Just a little."

658
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,958
All right. I'll be back shortly.

659
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,833
No sitting on the floor.
No leaning against the walls!

660
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,083
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

661
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:14,292
I'd I've to.

662
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,625
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.

663
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,500
In the sky

664
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:11,083
I don't know if it's cloudy
or bright

665
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,833
because I only have eyes

666
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:21,208
for you, dear

667
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:25,708
The moon maybe high

668
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:00,333
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now!

669
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,333
Anne, are you listening to me?

670
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:09,958
Anne?

671
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:18,042
- I told you not to sit on the floor!
- But it's clean.

672
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,667
It makes no difference.
Why can't you do as you're told?

673
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:49,375
- What's the matter?
- Where is my daughter?

674
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,958
What have you done
with my daughter?

675
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:58,292
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

676
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,292
You're not my daughter!

677
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,667
You're not my daughter!

678
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:27,000
- Ma'am, I heard shouts...
- She wants to kill me!

679
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:29,292
She won't stop until she kills us!

680
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,208
She won't stop!
She won't stop until she kills us!

681
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:35,750
- Hush, child. Come with me.
- You're wicked! You're wicked!

682
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:38,458
Wicked!

683
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,292
How is she?

684
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:54,583
There's no calming her
so I've left her with her father.

685
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:58,042
She insisted on speaking with him.

686
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,292
- What happened? Why did you fight?
- It wasn't her.

687
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,458
It was the old woman,
with the strange eyes.

688
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,792
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

689
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:16,250
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

690
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:22,000
God. God Help me.

691
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:28,375
What's the matter with me? I don't
know what's the matter with me.

692
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,583
You must get more rest.

693
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:37,708
You can't take on all the
responsibility of this house.

694
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:42,000
Leave it to us.
We know what has to be done.

695
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,208
What do you mean by that?

696
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,542
- How you know what has to be done?
- Nothing, I was just suggesting...

697
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,750
There's nothing to suggest!

698
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,083
Who do you think you are! You have
no idea what has to be done!

699
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,167
Or do you?

700
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,667
What are these?

701
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,792
The tablets for your migraine.

702
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:20,125
The ones you always take.

703
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:22,667
Please, I need to be on my own.

704
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:26,500
Yes, ma'am.

705
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,208
Come, on child.

706
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:16,042
Anne told me everything.

707
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:24,833
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

708
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:29,125
At first I thought there was someone
else here, maybe ghosts.

709
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,708
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

710
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:35,125
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

711
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:46,000
- I don't know what you mean.
- Tell me is not true.

712
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:48,208
Tell me what happened.

713
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,208
Happened?

714
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,583
I don't know what
came over me that day.

715
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:03,542
The servants had left
during the night.

716
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:07,083
They hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

717
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:14,625
And they knew that
I couldn't leave the house.

718
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,667
They knew.

719
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:21,917
Anne?

720
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,208
Anne, what happened?

721
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:33,375
She hit me. She went mad...
like she did that day.

722
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,125
Do you remember?

723
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:39,042
No.

724
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,208
You must forgive me, Charles.

725
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,083
Not me. The children.

726
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,417
They know that I I've them.

727
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:56,375
They know I'd never hurt them.
I'd die first.

728
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:02,125
What are you going to do?

729
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,500
Are you angry with me?

730
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:13,500
I came back to say goodbye to my
wife and children. Now I must go.

731
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:16,542
Go where?

732
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,875
- To the front.
- The war's over.

733
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:26,000
- The war is not over.
- What are you talking about?

734
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:31,625
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once. You can't go!

735
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,458
Why?

736
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:39,458
Why did you go to that stupid war
that had nothing to do with us?

737
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,875
- Why didn't you stay like the others?
- The others surrendered.

738
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:48,917
We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied!

739
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:52,208
What did you expect?

740
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,833
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

741
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,625
Your place was here, with us.

742
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:06,500
With your family.

743
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:14,292
I loved you.

744
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:17,958
And that was enough for me.

745
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:21,917
Living in this darkness...

746
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,875
in this prison.

747
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:34,000
But not for you.
I wasn't enough for you.

748
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:37,125
That's why you left.

749
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,875
It wasn't just the war.

750
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,333
You want to leave me, don't you?

751
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:40,083
Forgive me, Grace.

752
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,125
Anne!

753
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,083
Nicholas!

754
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,625
What?

755
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,458
My God!

756
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:19,792
Wait! My God!

757
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:41,833
Where are the curtains?

758
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:49,167
Mrs. Mills!

759
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,625
Let me see it, let me see it.

760
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:09,917
Are you all right?

761
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:12,417
I want my daddy.

762
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,250
Daddy's gone.

763
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:21,208
It's not true!

764
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,125
Yes, it is!

765
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,083
It is true.

766
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,375
I I've you, mummy.

767
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:40,333
Find the curtains.

768
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:46,333
Who was it? Who did this?

769
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:49,583
Tell me! Tell me!

770
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,125
You know what's happening here.

771
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:56,958
You know because it happened
to you, too! Now tell me!

772
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,208
Write it down.

773
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,708
Write it down. Please.

774
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:04,833
That attitude won't solve
anything, ma'am.

775
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,167
And anyway she can't write.

776
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,833
- Where are they?
- What?

777
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:11,625
The curtains!

778
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:15,708
Someone has taken the curtains
my children's lives depend on!

779
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:19,792
I have noticed, there's no need
for you to raise your voice.

780
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,333
Mr. Tuttle, I was just
on the point of calling you.

781
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:27,667
Did you know someone's
taken all the curtains?

782
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:33,292
The curtains? Oh, dear.

783
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:37,125
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

784
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,083
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

785
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,250
Daylight. Of course.

786
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:49,625
- Someone wants to kill my children!
- And the Daylight would kill them?

787
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:53,125
Are you mad?

788
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,500
I told you.

789
01:18:56,167 --> 01:19:00,625
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them

790
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:03,583
Yes, but that was before.

791
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,208
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

792
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:10,750
If you never expose them to light,
how do you know they're not cured?

793
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:15,500
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism...

794
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,833
in her legs and back.

795
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:20,417
Then one fine day...

796
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,042
they disappeared.

797
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,708
I'm going to find those curtains...

798
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:31,250
and after you Help me hang them,
you will leave this house.

799
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:49,875
What about the master? What does
he have to say about all this?

800
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:54,542
Give me your keys.
I want your keys, now.

801
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:01,083
I know what you want.

802
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:04,042
You want to frighten us,
to get us out, me and my children.

803
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,500
You've wanted to take over this
house ever since you arrived.

804
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:12,208
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

805
01:20:12,417 --> 01:20:16,833
- Try and calm down, ma'am.
- Give me the keys!

806
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,375
Give them to me!

807
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,375
And now, get out of here.

808
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:48,500
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

809
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:53,208
I think I've reached the end
of my tether. What about you?

810
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:58,208
Oh, yes, definitely.

811
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:02,167
We'd better go and
uncover the gravestones.

812
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:44,917
- What's mummy doing?
- I've told you. She's gone mad.

813
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,083
- Liar.
- She's gone mad.

814
01:21:47,292 --> 01:21:48,292
Liar!

815
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,042
- She's gone mad. She's gone mad!
- Liar! Liar!

816
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,792
Night time.

817
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,042
- Where are you going?
- I've had enough.

818
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:08,375
- I'm going to look for daddy.
- Are you going to run away?

819
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,708
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

820
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:16,583
It's very easy.

821
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,125
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

822
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,833
Anne, wait!

823
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,125
I want to come and
Look for daddy, too.

824
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:52,417
Liar, you just don't want
to be left on your own.

825
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:55,375
- Scaredypants, scaredypants!
- Be quiet!

826
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,542
Anne, I think we've gotten lost.

827
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,167
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

828
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:58,083
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come, then.

829
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:05,125
- Say something.
- What Shall I say?

830
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,542
I don't know. Anything.

831
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,208
Let's see. My name's Anne
and I'm walking.

832
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:12,625
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

833
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,750
What's that over there?

834
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,792
I think they're graves.

835
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,875
- Don't go near.
- Why not?

836
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,167
What if a ghost jumps out?

837
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,500
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

838
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,167
- There's something written here.
- Let's go.

839
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,917
Wait.

840
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:42,833
Anne, what does it say?

841
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,625
- You must be strong now, children.
- Nicholas, come here!

842
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:58,708
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell mummy
we've run away.

843
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,833
Don't speak to them!

844
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,542
- Why?
- They're dead.

845
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,542
- What?
- They're ghosts! Please come here!

846
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,708
Children...

847
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:10,792
Nicholas!

848
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:15,333
If they're ghosts, why aren't they
wearing sheets and clanking chains?

849
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:18,792
- You said that...
- I don't care! Get away from them!

850
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,042
You're always teasing me and
telling lies, and I'm sick of it.

851
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,458
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth! Come here!

852
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,458
Wait!

853
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,583
Children!

854
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,167
Run! Run!

855
01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:49,292
Run! Into the house!

856
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:55,750
Don't come any closer!
Don't move!

857
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,625
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
Tuberculosis finished us off...

858
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,167
more than half a century ago.

859
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,792
Go away!

860
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,667
Open the door, ma'am, please.

861
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:42,000
- What do you want?
- Mummy, don't open the door!

862
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,917
- We've seen their graves.
- Go upstairs and hide.

863
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,917
- Go on!
- I'm scared.

864
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,500
Don't separate.

865
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,833
Anne!

866
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,542
Whatever you do, don't separate.

867
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,583
Go hide. Go!

868
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:14,333
We've been trying
to make you understand.

869
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,958
- Understand what?
- About the house.

870
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,708
About the new situation.

871
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:24,625
What situation?

872
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:31,250
We must all learn to live together.
The living and the dead.

873
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:35,833
If you're dead, leave us in peace!

874
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,417
Leave us in peace!

875
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,583
Leave us in peace!

876
01:28:46,917 --> 01:28:48,875
In here. Get inside.

877
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:59,375
And suppose we do leave you,
do you think they will?

878
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,583
- Who?
- The intruders.

879
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:06,000
- There are no intruders.
- They took the curtains down.

880
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:09,583
- There are no intruders.
- Yes, I assure you it was them.

881
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:14,708
And now they're in there,
with you and the children.

882
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,500
Waiting for you!

883
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:23,333
And believe me, sooner or later
they'll find you.

884
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:26,167
Listen, wait here and
I'll be back in a minute.

885
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:28,750
Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

886
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:31,625
I can't leave her on her own!

887
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,875
Stop breathing like that.

888
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:47,750
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

889
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,292
Stop breathing!

890
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:58,458
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.

891
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,500
Come with us... children.

892
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:07,000
Come with us.

893
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,667
Nicholas?

894
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:19,708
Anne?

895
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,833
Where are you?

896
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,083
Answer me!

897
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:32,375
- The intruders have found them.
- There's nothing we can do now.

898
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:37,208
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

899
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:57,958
Our Father, who art in heaven...

900
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:02,042
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come.

901
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:06,333
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

902
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:11,500
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

903
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,167
Why are you afraid, children?

904
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:20,792
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

905
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,708
Come on.

906
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,833
Come on, speak to us.

907
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,875
Speak to us.

908
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:36,625
Tell me what happened.

909
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:40,458
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

910
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:44,500
"Don't tell her."

911
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,375
If I tell her,
they'll leave us in peace.

912
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,875
Mummy!

913
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:54,917
"Mummy."

914
01:31:55,083 --> 01:32:01,750
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?

915
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:05,917
What did your mother do to you?

916
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:19,792
Something about a pillow...

917
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,917
Is that how she killed you?

918
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:25,500
With a pillow?

919
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,750
- She didn't kill us.
- Children, if you're dead...

920
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:31,667
why do you remain in this house?

921
01:32:31,875 --> 01:32:33,417
We're not dead!

922
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:38,125
- Why do you remain in this house?
- We're not dead!

923
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,250
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

924
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:43,000
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

925
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,208
Why do you remain in this house?

926
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,000
"We're not dead, we're not dead."

927
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:51,792
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

928
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,542
We're not dead!

929
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:57,583
We're not dead!
We're not... dead!

930
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:14,583
Are you all right?

931
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,333
Yes, just a bit dizzy. That's all.

932
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,250
What happened?

933
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,125
- They made contact.
- All three?

934
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:32,583
Apparently, yes.
The mother and the two children.

935
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:35,958
Quite interesting, don't you think?

936
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:39,333
Interesting?
I was scared out of my wits!

937
01:33:39,542 --> 01:33:41,125
Darling, calm down.

938
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:45,667
So far we have handled this
your way. But now you listen to me.

939
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:48,250
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

940
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:51,417
It is quite clear that these "beings"
do not want us to live here.

941
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:54,000
- We don't know about them yet.
- Yes, we do.

942
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:59,917
The woman went mad, smothered her
two children and then shot herself.

943
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:04,292
- That's enough. Think of our son.
- There's nothing wrong with Victor.

944
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,125
Yes, there is! He has nightmares,
he says he has seen that girl.

945
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,792
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

946
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:14,833
Please, let us leave this house.

947
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:19,333
All right.
We will leave tomorrow morning.

948
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:22,167
Thank God for that.

949
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:25,792
I'll just go and check on Victor.

950
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,250
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

951
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,917
A pleasure.
I hope we've been of some Help.

952
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:38,000
Yes, of course, but I admit that was
not the most pleasant evening...

953
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:43,708
At first I couldn't understand...

954
01:34:45,292 --> 01:34:48,667
what the pillow was doing
in my hands...

955
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,458
and why you didn't move.

956
01:34:57,708 --> 01:35:00,250
But then I knew.

957
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:05,042
It had happened.

958
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:11,250
I had killed my children.

959
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:19,625
I got the rifle...

960
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:23,792
I put it to my forehead...

961
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,083
and I pulled the trigger.

962
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,292
Nothing.

963
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:46,750
And then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

964
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:54,542
You were playing with the pillows,
as if nothing had happened.

965
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,792
And I thought...

966
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,333
the Lord, in his great mercy...

967
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:08,000
was giving me another chance...

968
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:11,125
telling me...

969
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:14,250
"Don't give up...

970
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,917
be strong...

971
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:23,125
be a good mother...

972
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:26,833
for them."

973
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:32,292
But now...

974
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:37,000
Now...

975
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:42,542
what does all this mean?

976
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,875
Where are we?

977
01:36:49,917 --> 01:36:52,333
Young Lydia asked
the very same thing...

978
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,208
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

979
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,667
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

980
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:05,625
But I couldn't tell you that
before now.

981
01:37:10,417 --> 01:37:13,917
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea,
ma'am?

982
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:21,833
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

983
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:27,208
Now, sometimes we'll sense them
and other times we won't.

984
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:31,417
But that's the way
it's always been...

985
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:35,500
ma'am.

986
01:37:39,042 --> 01:37:40,792
Mummy?

987
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,958
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

988
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:50,125
- Will we ever see him again?
- I don't know.

989
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:55,292
If we're dead, where's limbo?

990
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:02,375
I don't know
if there even is a limbo.

991
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,458
I'm no wiser than you are.

992
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:12,500
But I do know that I I've you.

993
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:16,875
I've always loved you.

994
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:22,583
And this house is ours.

995
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:25,458
You say with me:

996
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:29,125
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

997
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:31,667
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

998
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,917
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

999
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:55,875
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1000
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:09,917
No one can make us
leave this house.

1001
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:38,417
Come a long, Victor.
