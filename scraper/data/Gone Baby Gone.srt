1
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,459
I always believed
it was the things you don't choose

2
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,627
that makes you who you are.

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,298
Your city.

4
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,300
Your neighbourhood.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,636
Your family.

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,726
People here take pride in these things.

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,729
Like it was something
they'd accomplished.

8
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,318
The bodies around their souls.

9
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,489
The cities wrapped around those.

10
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,016
I lived on this block my whole life.

11
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,478
Most of these people have.

12
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,858
When yourjob is to find people
who are missing,

13
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,611
it helps to know where they started.

14
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,407
I find the people
who started in the cracks,

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,368
and then fell through.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,668
This city can be hard.

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,632
When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven

18
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,344
and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.

19
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,560
He told me what God said
to his children.

20
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,939
"You are sheep among wolves,

21
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,151
"be wise as serpents,

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,237
"yet innocent as doves."

23
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,865
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,367
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

25
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,244
You know, to get Annette
in high school, you have...

26
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,628
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

27
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,430
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

28
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,766
That was her. She was always smiling.

29
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,978
I mean, who would take my little girl?

30
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,813
She never hurt anybody,
never caused...

31
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,401
Whoever you are, if you have her,

32
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,737
you just let her go.

33
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,281
Now, we won't charge you,

34
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,911
but if you're out there,
just let her come home.

35
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,788
All right? Let her come home.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,999
I mean, who would take my little girl?

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,418
- You fucking cops.
- She never caused no trouble,

38
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,879
she never got in any fights,
she's a sweetheart.

39
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,216
- This is just unbelievable.
- She was a good kid.

40
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,384
The whole force
standing outside the house,

41
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,346
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

42
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,183
I mean, are the kidnappers
coming back?

43
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,227
Amanda McCready was taken
from her home

44
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,104
between 8:00 and 8:30
Wednesday night.

45
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,899
She's four years old,
has blond hair and green eyes...

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,025
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,070
Weighs 35 pounds
and is 40 inches tall.

48
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,489
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I know.

49
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,453
A beleaguered police force
and a weary citizenry

50
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,785
have been left with so little to cling to.

51
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,830
A blanket, a back door,
and a doll named Mirabelle.

52
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,707
The neighbourhood's
really coming together.

53
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,875
We're gonna have a rally.

54
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,462
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

55
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,297
You know,
the neighbourhood's all alert,

56
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,676
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that...

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,222
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,267
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

59
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,727
In related news,
the Boston police captain

60
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,855
responsible for preventing
crimes against children

61
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,024
spoke a few words a moment ago,

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,651
words of comfort.

63
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,947
I know the pain of losing a daughter.
We will not fail.

64
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,367
We will pursue every avenue.

65
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,535
Do you know the mother?

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,662
Captain Jack Doyle on details
of the missing Dorchester girl...

67
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,041
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

68
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,793
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

69
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,255
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

70
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,924
I don't know about innocent.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,386
Her mother says Amanda
may be carrying a little girl of her own.

72
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,889
Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.
It's her favourite doll.

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,310
This is horrible.

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,230
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

75
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,445
Good night.

76
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,664
- Hey, Angie. Get the door?
- I'm in the bathroom.

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,547
It's 7:00! Seven in the fucking morning!

78
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,757
What?

79
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,760
Are you Patrick Kenzie?

80
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,555
- Yeah.
- Bea and Lionel McCready.

81
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,682
Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

82
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,227
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologise.

83
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,993
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighbourhood,

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,524
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

85
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,942
So that's the reason for the language.

86
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,467
- Oh.
- Well, we can come back later.

87
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,987
No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

88
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,832
Here, we're just...
I'm sorry about the mess.

89
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,992
We've been...
I had a late case, and a lot of cases.

90
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,744
We've just been...
We've just been working a lot,

91
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,997
we worked on a case last night,
you know, so we just...

92
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,999
Please sit down, though.

93
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,837
Or...

94
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,758
My associate'll be in in just a minute.
She's in the other room.

95
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,593
How can we help you?

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,678
Do you know people
in the neighbourhood

97
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,139
who don't talk to the police?

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,849
Yeah, one or two.

99
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,021
We wanna hire you to augment
the investigation of Amanda.

100
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,231
Is that right?

101
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,360
You know how in JonBenet Ramsey
the family hired investigators?

102
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,196
So... Are the police all right
with youse hiring outside help?

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,740
The police need to worry
about finding my niece.

104
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,035
Hi. I'm Angie Gennaro.
I work with Patrick.

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,204
Hello. I'm Bea McCready.
This is my husband, Lionel.

106
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,580
- How do you do?
- They wanna hire us

107
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,708
to augment the investigation.

108
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,211
You should talk
to Precision Investigators.

109
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,921
- Who? I...
- I don't know, I meant...

110
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,285
Well, let's hear them out, Ange.

111
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,883
Well, aren't you
missing persons detectives?

112
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,718
Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

113
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,179
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,890
I'm sorry, she...
I think that what Angie means to say is,

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,726
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

116
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:21,565
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

117
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,567
who've gone missing that they...

118
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,527
You know, they just stop payments on
their Jet Ski

119
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,653
and they went to New Hampshire...

120
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,991
Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

121
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,955
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

122
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,494
Well, you're not gonna
do any harm, are you?

123
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,039
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

124
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,500
- So, that's collateral, if...
- No. It's not that.

125
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,378
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,671
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

127
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,299
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

128
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,844
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

129
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,555
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

130
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,725
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

131
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,144
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

132
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,645
She was watching Wife Swap.

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,939
She remembers,
'cause that's her favourite show.

134
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,274
And do youse two live upstairs?

135
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,444
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

136
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,155
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

137
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,448
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

138
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,613
you can't get away from it.

139
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,451
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

140
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,537
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- Lionel, talk to Helene?

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,831
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

142
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,501
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

143
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,170
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

144
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,381
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

145
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,884
My sister Helene has not had that.

146
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,763
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

147
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,932
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

148
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,350
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

149
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,715
Oh, you'll find us
in that brown three-decker by the park.

150
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,188
- You know where it is.
- Be hard to miss today.

151
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,126
Look at this. Jesus.

152
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,213
Fucking block party here.

153
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,553
Four Cape Verdeans
got killed here last year.

154
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,596
No one gave a shit.

155
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,729
We have a good life, right?

156
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,816
Is that a trick question?

157
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,238
I don't wanna find their little kid
in a dumpster.

158
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,824
Maybe she's not in a dumpster, babe.

159
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,954
I don't wanna find a little kid after
they've been abused for three days.

160
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,334
Hon, nobody does.

161
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,132
All right.

162
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,093
Listen, we'll just go up
and we'll talk to them,

163
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,097
and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

164
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,307
Okay.

165
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,986
Hi. Please, come on in.

166
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,365
Helene.

167
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,951
This is Patrick Kenzie,
Angela Gennaro.

168
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,955
- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

169
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,460
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

170
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,878
Would you excuse us, Dottie?

171
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,049
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

172
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,383
Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

173
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,635
We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

174
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,470
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

175
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,222
- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

176
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,975
I already talked to the cops forty times.

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,144
- We're sorry to take up your time.
- Listen, we're not the cops.

178
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,628
Beatrice asked us to come over here

179
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,231
and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

180
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,735
Why don't Bea mind her business?
It's my kid.

181
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,904
'Cause everyone gotta
have their moment, now.

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,072
- Right?
- Right.

183
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,408
Beatrice hired these people to help
find Amanda with her own money,

184
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,414
so you had better show them
the goddamn courtesy

185
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,496
- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

186
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,997
She could grieve
how she wants, Dottie.

187
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,362
- You don't live here!
- Asshole.

188
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,168
Don't you fucking yell at her, Lionel.
You ain't her father!

189
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,253
Fuck you, Lionel.

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,673
Go fuck yourself. Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

191
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,508
Get the fuck outta here.

192
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,218
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,845
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe we should go.

194
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,431
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

195
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,433
Maybe we should go?

196
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,063
Look. Can we all just have a few words
in the hallway, please?

197
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,358
Excuse us, Helene.

198
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,122
- Helene's got emotional problems.
- It's not that, Lionel.

199
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,957
- What is it, then?
- She's a cunt!

200
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,460
- Beatrice, don't use that word.
- God help me, it's true.

201
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:04,723
This is a child.
And I don't know where she is.

202
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,573
Well...

203
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,413
We can't do any harm, right?

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,339
It's all right, Bea.
It's all right, Bea. Huh?

205
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,175
Thank you.

206
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,634
Now...

207
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:48,099
Well, she's quiet.
She tries very hard to be a good girl.

208
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,437
What about Helene? Her friends?
People she hangs out with?

209
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,939
She got a lot of people
come by the house?

210
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,151
I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

211
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,945
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

212
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,031
Yeah, she drinks every day.

213
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,368
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

214
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,455
She use drugs?

215
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,290
I think she does a little coke.

216
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,459
How much is a little?

217
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:20,298
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

218
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,801
Few times a week's a lot.

219
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,970
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

220
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,517
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

221
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,855
Congratulations.

222
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,068
Do you mind if we see her room?

223
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,921
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

224
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,273
10-7 investigation.

225
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,235
Solved it yet?

226
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,739
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

227
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,077
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

228
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,205
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

229
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,456
It was not.

230
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,544
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

231
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,714
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

232
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,050
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

233
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,636
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

234
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,892
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

235
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,393
I think Mrs McCready was hoping
we could help

236
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,730
with the neighbourhood aspect of this
investigation, the people, you know.

237
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,398
How old are you?

238
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,319
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

239
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,161
A four-year-old child is on the street.

240
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,830
It's 76 hours and counting.

241
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,582
And the prospects
for where she might be

242
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,084
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

243
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,088
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

244
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,507
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

245
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,344
only about 10% are ever solved.

246
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,346
This is day three.

247
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,101
He may look young,

248
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,271
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

249
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,025
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

250
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,361
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

251
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,447
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

252
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,115
So he expects to be.

253
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,328
And he will be.

254
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,876
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

255
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,713
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

256
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,344
We're just trying to help, Captain.

257
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,476
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

258
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,148
Good afternoon.

259
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,486
Ready to get started?

260
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,000
All I'm saying is that we heard
Helene comes in here.

261
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,919
We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

262
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:49,674
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

263
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,926
All right.

264
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,429
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

265
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,681
Big Dave. All right.

266
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,018
I'm Medium Patrick. Nice to meet you.

267
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,354
You're a little fucking light in the ass
to be talking shit, ain't ya?

268
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,523
Jesus, pal, I'm just playing.

269
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,693
Listen, buy a couple
of fucking drinks or screw.

270
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,070
Okay, we'll take a couple tonics.

271
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,907
Jesus Christ.

272
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,287
Steve Penteroudakis!
The Grecian Formula!

273
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,872
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?

274
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,316
Look at this little motherfucker
at the Fillmore, what's up?

275
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,542
Gyro!

276
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,794
Beers and keno, 2:00 in the afternoon.

277
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,129
- What up?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,801
Yeah, listen, I been fucking everywhere
putting up posters, man, you know?

279
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,138
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

280
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,890
You know? I mean, it's a real tragedy.

281
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,850
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

282
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,103
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

283
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,066
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

284
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,692
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,196
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

286
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,782
So how often Helene come down here?

287
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,200
Five nights a week.

288
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,119
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

289
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,445
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

290
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,498
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so...

291
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,376
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

292
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,128
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

293
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,964
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

294
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,091
You saw her on the news, right?

295
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,844
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbour's house for a half hour."

296
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,973
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

297
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,560
- What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

298
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,771
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

299
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,941
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

300
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,567
and I was banging on the fucking door.

301
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,820
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

302
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,571
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

303
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,739
I was banging on the door.

304
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,865
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

305
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,534
but I know he's fucking in there.

306
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,662
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

307
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,666
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

308
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,835
Don't talk about people you don't know.

309
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,169
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

310
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,421
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

311
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,715
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

312
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,510
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

313
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,387
Why don't you mind your business?

314
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,848
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

315
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,267
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

316
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,645
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

317
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,524
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

318
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,235
Trying to help Helene
find her daughter. Is that all right?

319
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,695
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

320
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,446
thinking you're better than me.

321
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,699
I'm not the fucking one.

322
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,659
- All right, just cool it.
- Cool it.

323
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,579
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

324
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,832
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you guys?

325
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,209
You, you punk fucking jackass.

326
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,220
We're leaving, all right?

327
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,393
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

328
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,732
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

329
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,618
Open that door, rummy.

330
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,622
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

331
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,011
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

332
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,434
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

333
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,479
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

334
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,397
What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

335
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,523
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

336
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,859
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

337
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,985
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

338
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,322
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

339
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,574
Fucking unbelievable.

340
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,946
- Can I help you?
- You Detective Bressant?

341
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,032
- That's right.
- Patrick Kenzie. Did you just call me?

342
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,577
Oh, sorry.
Sergeant Detective Remy Bressant.

343
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,621
How you doing?

344
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,833
- Should we... Sit down?
- Something wrong?

345
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,501
No! I just...

346
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,504
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

347
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,090
Life's full of surprises.

348
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,677
Corwin Earle.
Serial molester, recently work-released.

349
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,263
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

350
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,807
Known associates, Leon Trett

351
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,895
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

352
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,691
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

353
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,942
They have drug habits.

354
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,778
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

355
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,449
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

356
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,202
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

357
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,954
Apparently the three of them

358
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,999
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

359
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,419
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

360
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,922
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

361
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,299
Do you think this is who has Amanda?

362
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,800
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

363
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,053
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

364
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,014
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

365
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,353
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

366
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,479
No, we got more.

367
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,106
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

368
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,900
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

369
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,610
we've interviewed every neighbour
in a mile radius

370
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,403
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

371
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,197
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

372
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,323
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

373
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,408
Who the fuck is this guy?

374
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,062
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

375
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,830
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

376
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,290
Otherwise, hey, you...

377
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,710
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

378
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,672
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

379
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,051
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

380
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,428
that are capable of doing this.

381
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,099
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

382
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,351
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

383
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,939
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

384
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,442
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

385
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,654
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

386
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,906
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

387
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,575
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

388
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,160
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

389
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,496
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

390
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,956
Fascinating.

391
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,168
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

392
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,214
She did bullshit us.

393
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

394
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,176
Meet you down there.

395
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,474
So what kinda name is Bressant?

396
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,685
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

397
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,353
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

398
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,273
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

399
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,653
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

400
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,657
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

401
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,409
So who's right?

402
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,952
I'll mull it over.

403
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,079
- What's up, sucker?
- Bubba.

404
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,497
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

405
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,062
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

406
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,501
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

407
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,379
You seen those people?

408
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,217
Drug addict, drug addict, fucking...
Paedophile.

409
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,345
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

410
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,182
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

411
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,142
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

412
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,810
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

413
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,896
They're not all three child molesters.

414
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,316
Just... Just this one, Corwin Earle.

415
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,736
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

416
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,505
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

417
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,115
We got hired to find that little girl.

418
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,034
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

419
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,160
while the kid was taken.

420
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,954
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

421
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,749
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

422
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,793
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

423
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,128
Ray works for Cheese?

424
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,758
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

425
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,510
Did you ever sell to Helene?

426
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,553
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

427
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,347
between us right now.

428
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,599
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

429
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,226
Or coconuts like Cheese.

430
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,352
You should know better by now.

431
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,771
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

432
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

433
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,733
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

434
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,653
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

435
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,448
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

436
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,451
- Who?
- Come on, sweetheart.

437
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,329
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

438
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,208
Oh, sounds familiar.

439
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,963
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

440
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:55,386
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

441
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,223
Either you know him or you don't.

442
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,851
Who is he?

443
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,312
He's a drug lord or something, isn't he?

444
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,022
Helene, who is he?

445
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,567
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- Thank you.

446
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,153
He is, among other things,
Mrs McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

447
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,156
- What other things?
- I don't know.

448
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,117
Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

449
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,743
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

450
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,121
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

451
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,956
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

452
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,374
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

453
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,500
You know what I mean!

454
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,335
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

455
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,297
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

456
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,675
- Perfect. You associate with a pimp.
- A pornographer? Helene.

457
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,011
And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

458
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,722
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

459
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,682
What do you do for him?

460
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,852
I just mule.

461
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,687
Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

462
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,481
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

463
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,526
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

464
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,029
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

465
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,198
- Where?
- Providence...

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,950
Does it fucking matter?

467
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,201
You think I'm fucking around, here?

468
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,705
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

469
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,669
Better answer his question, Helene.

470
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,213
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

471
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,925
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

472
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,927
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

473
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,929
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine and heroin.

474
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:25,809
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

475
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,270
Yeah, less addictive that way.

476
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,399
Piece of work.

477
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,876
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

478
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,081
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

479
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,959
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

480
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,754
Did you know I used to work DCU?

481
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,590
- I give a fuck.
- Okay.

482
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,761
So, I still know some of those guys
real well.

483
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,555
Anyway, I heard someone
ripped Cheese off

484
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,599
on a New Hampshire run.

485
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,602
- Did you hear anything about that?
- No.

486
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,231
- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

487
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,692
Different questions this time.

488
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,903
Come on. It's all right.

489
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,825
We don't care about a
couple of hopheads beating each other.

490
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,868
We care about your child.

491
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,246
So come on.

492
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,665
How much?

493
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,878
You even give a fuck about your kid?

494
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,548
'Course I do.

495
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:42,928
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

496
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,304
How much?

497
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,977
How much?

498
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,980
How much?

499
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,650
One thirty.

500
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:07,453
- $130,000?
- Yes, Bea.

501
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,163
How'd you do it?

502
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,545
Me and Ray had to do this
run up Nashua, right?

503
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,005
Yeah.

504
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,674
We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

505
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,427
When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

506
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,764
these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

507
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:31,769
and Amanda was with us,
so we just pretended to be like a family.

508
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,063
- And we got in the car, took off.
- You took Amanda with you?

509
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,358
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Leave her in the car, Bea?

510
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,195
I don't got no daycare.

511
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,825
It's really hard being a mother.
It's hard raising a family, you know?

512
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,995
All on my own.

513
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,581
But God made you barren,
so you wouldn't fucking know.

514
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,708
- So I understand, Bea, okay?
- You are an abomination.

515
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,376
- Hey, hey, hey. Right here.
- As God is my witness.

516
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,545
Right here. What happened next?

517
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:05,385
We was driving back,
and Ray, fucking Ray was like,

518
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,388
"You know everyone's gonna think
the cops got the money."

519
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,434
- You told Cheese the cops got it.
- But you and Ray kept the money.

520
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:18,357
- This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.
- Where's the money now, Helene?

521
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,487
- It's with Ray.
- And where's Ray?

522
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,159
- Chelsea.
- Let's go. Come on.

523
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,912
She rides with you.
I don't want her in my car.

524
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,016
- Go on. Move your bike!
- Go fuck your mother.

525
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,686
- What the...
- Beat it, sucker!

526
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,944
Helene, you used to go
with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?

527
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,530
- How do you know?
- You know, I went to Saint Mark's.

528
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,575
I was a freshman when you were
a senior. You don't remember me?

529
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,784
No.

530
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,162
Whatever happened to Scott?

531
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,291
He stabbed a foreign exchange student
in the chest.

532
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,627
He got life in Walpole.
He's a faggot now.

533
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,798
He was kind of a faggot in high school.

534
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,928
Oh, man. You're terrible. He was cute.

535
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,639
Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.

536
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,101
Oh, who's a faggot now?
You're dating a faggot.

537
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,649
So, how did the...
How'd the money end up in Chelsea?

538
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,068
I thought youse and...
You and Ray went home after.

539
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,988
No, we dropped off Amanda
and went back to Ray's.

540
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,158
But fucking retarded Ray
left his baby rock at my place.

541
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,161
You know, right then, I'm like,
"I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

542
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,830
"I don't care if he does got a big dick."

543
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,500
So we went back to the apartment
and Ray was hollering,

544
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,587
he was gonna wake up Amanda,
she needs her sleep, you know?

545
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,506
So, we went back to Ray's,

546
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,508
- or Ray's mother's. Whatever.
- Yeah?

547
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,012
I don't know where that mother went,
but she left all her fucking cats in there,

548
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,014
and it smells like cock.

549
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,684
And Cheese never contacted you,
never left you a note?

550
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,519
No.
We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.

551
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,271
That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."

552
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,190
You didn't think it was worth it
for your daughter's sake

553
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,693
to tell people what happened?
Cheese has your kid.

554
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,615
God fucking knows
what he's doing to her.

555
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,950
What am I gonna do?

556
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,452
Call Cheese and be like,
"You got my daughter?

557
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,204
"'Cause I just ripped you off,
and I'm just checking."

558
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,372
Yeah!

559
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,207
- Helene, sit back.
- Oh, my God!

560
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,710
Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,
and be like, "You know,

561
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,047
"just so you know, wanna know
I run coke and heroin

562
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,382
"in case that's irrelevant."

563
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,176
- All right, calm down. Calm down.
- You make me sick.

564
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,056
What makes you think Ray hasn't
spent all the money, Helene?

565
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,308
Nigger, please. I hid it.

566
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,559
Pull over.

567
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,171
Looks like somebody had a little talk
with Ray before they shot him.

568
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,591
- Looks like he held out pretty good.
- He didn't have it.

569
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,430
He couldn't tell them where the money
was, because he didn't know.

570
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,098
Helene hid it.

571
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,227
Ray made poor relationship choices.

572
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,605
Guess they didn't believe him.

573
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,107
Poor prick.

574
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,609
I'm not waiting in a fucking car.

575
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,628
- Where's the money, Helene?
- I give a fuck about the money.

576
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,049
- Helene...
- I just want my daughter home with me.

577
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:16,553
I know it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry.
It's very upsetting about Ray. But...

578
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,389
- Where's the money?
- It's right there.

579
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,809
- Where?
- Buried it when Ray was passed out.

580
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,644
What was that book about,

581
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,731
Everything You Need
Is in Your Own Backyard?

582
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,151
- I think it was a French book.
- Yeah, that wasn't a book.

583
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,403
- That was a book.
- No, it was a cartoon.

584
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,988
- The fuck out of here.
- No, it was a cartoon.

585
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,240
- Right, Helene?
- Fuck youse both.

586
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,492
Should we bring in the FBl
at this point?

587
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,827
- That's the worst thing we could do.
- Why is that?

588
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,746
'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese
kill Amanda

589
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,081
after he opens a bag
full of newspapers.

590
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,582
It's kidnapping.

591
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,336
- I don't see a note. You see a note?
- Nope. No note.

592
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,671
We're investigating
a missing children's case, here.

593
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,092
Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.
Fastest way to get Amanda home

594
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,178
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

595
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,681
- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

596
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,185
Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

597
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,270
Cheese went another way.

598
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,691
- He wouldn't hurt her, right?
- Ask Ray.

599
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,527
All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

600
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,029
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

601
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,616
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

602
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,035
- Oh, you're gonna talk to him?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

603
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,204
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

604
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,957
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologise.

605
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,876
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

606
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,046
- We'll take care of this, all right?
- We'll meet you over there.

607
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,548
I'm hungry.

608
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,882
All right. I'll get you something, Helene.

609
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,634
No, her.

610
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,636
That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

611
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,222
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

612
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,391
She's not still hungry?

613
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,060
I don't know.

614
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,109
I know I fucked up.

615
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,445
I just want my daughter back.

616
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,365
I swear to God,
I won't use no drugs no more.

617
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,284
I won't even go out,
I'll be fucking straight.

618
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,952
Cross my heart.

619
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,289
It's all right.
We're gonna find her, Helene.

620
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,416
You have to. You promise?

621
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,129
Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.

622
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,759
Promise. You have to promise me.

623
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,803
I promise.

624
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,893
All right.

625
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,368
- Where do you think you're going?
- Talk to Cheese.

626
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,081
No, you're not. No, get back in the car.

627
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,750
No, that's a mistake.
He's never gonna talk to a badge.

628
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,195
- No. No way.
- It's too important.

629
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,836
You wanna get the girl back, or not?

630
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,838
I know him.
If there's a deal to be brokered,

631
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,174
- we're the ones who can do it.
- No, me and Nick are handling this.

632
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,259
Get back in the car.

633
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,011
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

634
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,515
then it is the FBl.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

635
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,766
All you're gonna do is scare him.

636
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,519
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

637
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,025
All right. Go ahead.

638
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,863
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

639
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,365
Good luck.

640
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,540
It's been a long time.

641
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,795
No. I quit.

642
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,221
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

643
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,394
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

644
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,857
Bitches love the cheddar.

645
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,866
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

646
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,329
Yeah. Good to hear it.

647
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,498
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

648
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,502
It's been too long not to see a fool.

649
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,588
I grant you audience.

650
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,757
Go.

651
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,345
We found what you
were looking for in Chelsea.

652
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,514
What I care about Chelsea?

653
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,768
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

654
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,770
What idiot?

655
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,940
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

656
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,112
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

657
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,783
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead...

658
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:35,038
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

659
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,753
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

660
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,633
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

661
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,136
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

662
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,639
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

663
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,808
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

664
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,644
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

665
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,814
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

666
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,899
It's either this, real quiet,

667
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,151
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

668
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,779
putting their fat knees in your neck.

669
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,492
Hold up.

670
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,833
What the fuck is this?

671
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,669
Lift up your shirt.

672
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,631
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

673
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,092
Lift up your shirt.

674
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,680
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

675
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,765
Lift up your shirt.

676
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,623
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

677
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,191
Let me see some tit.

678
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,117
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

679
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,038
You got my money,

680
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,876
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

681
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,878
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

682
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,213
I don't play scrimmage.

683
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,549
But I don't fuck with no kids.

684
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:18,224
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

685
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,226
'cause she's gone, baby.

686
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,520
Gone.

687
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,991
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

688
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,660
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

689
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,870
Okay?

690
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,337
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

691
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,507
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

692
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,426
But if it turns out you're lying,

693
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,179
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

694
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,931
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

695
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,475
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

696
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,645
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a Cl and a rat.

697
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,813
And I know a lot of people.

698
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,681
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

699
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,444
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

700
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,862
is gonna get raided.

701
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,448
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

702
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,951
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

703
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,453
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

704
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,247
by a gang of crackers.

705
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,292
'Cause from what I heard,

706
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,671
you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

707
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,589
life a motherfucker.

708
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,354
If I see you again,
I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

709
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,827
And get that sausage off my lawn.

710
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,497
- Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

711
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,333
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

712
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,336
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

713
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,380
Nothing else?

714
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,842
Yeah. He said that he wanted
you two off his lawn.

715
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,137
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

716
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,431
Half the guys he knows
are degenerates.

717
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,141
Yeah, you know
what the other half are?

718
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,227
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

719
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,190
No, no. I won't hold it against you.

720
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,069
You know what I'll hold against you?

721
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:39,657
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

722
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,702
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

723
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,747
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

724
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,707
hope to Christ we get lucky.

725
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,876
You know, if Amanda
dies because of this,

726
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,838
I won't have to hold it against you.

727
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,551
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

728
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,288
Hope we didn't fuck this up.

729
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,008
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

730
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,928
Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,
but he wants to go tonight.

731
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,597
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

732
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,392
They record calls at the station now.

733
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,019
- Jack got a hold of the transcript.
- What does that mean?

734
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,147
It means our badges are
basically fucking forfeit at this point.

735
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,108
He wants you both down here, now.

736
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,276
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

737
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,779
to prove that he's got Amanda.

738
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:25,304
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

739
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,643
Care to read the highlighted portion?

740
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,147
Aloud?

741
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:42,029
"Caller: Bitch, you better
have my money.

742
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,160
"Detective Bressant: Who is this?

743
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,788
"The caller:
You know who the fuck this is, fool...

744
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,332
"Creole curse words.
If you want that girl back,

745
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,877
"you need to meet me up
Quincy tonight.

746
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,563
"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

747
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,175
The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

748
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,889
Detective Bressant goes on to make
an unauthorised ransom arrangement

749
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,684
to exchange Amanda McCready
for $130,000 tonight

750
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,853
in just that location.

751
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,399
After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

752
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,193
to produce this.

753
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,403
Recognise it?

754
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,573
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

755
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,160
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

756
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,705
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

757
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,540
If I delay this now, after this agreement,

758
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,293
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

759
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,213
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

760
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,672
No, sir.

761
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,133
I went in there. I'll
accept responsibility.

762
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,052
You'll accept nothing!

763
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,888
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

764
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,892
Let me see that note.

765
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,234
My God.

766
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,405
He wants to separate us.

767
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,332
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

768
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,620
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

769
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,498
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

770
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,416
we turn over the cash.

771
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,587
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

772
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,798
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

773
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,508
What do you know about him?

774
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,511
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

775
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,762
If I had to guess.

776
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,598
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

777
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,101
- I don't know.
- Yes?

778
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,272
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

779
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,651
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

780
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,278
No, sir.

781
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,284
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

782
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,328
What you probably didn't hear,

783
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,621
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

784
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,125
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

785
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,754
Knowing that my little girl likely died

786
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,465
crying out for me
to come and save her.

787
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,010
And I never did.

788
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:16,017
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

789
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,645
by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

790
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,943
I know what it feels like to lose a child.

791
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,699
Now, damn it, you force my hand

792
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,076
and then you question
the way I handle it.

793
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,329
No one's questioning you, sir.

794
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,165
I honour my child with this division.

795
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,336
So that no parent
has to go through what I've known.

796
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,213
This child.

797
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,010
That's all I care about.

798
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,971
I'm gonna bring her home.

799
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,365
Why'd he bring us all the way up here?

800
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,119
I don't know. It's big. It's dark.
It's easy to get away.

801
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,245
No.

802
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,917
They're gonna kill her.

803
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:50,444
This asshole could've found some level
fucking ground somewhere.

804
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,532
This is where we part ways.
You guys'll be on top of that cliff.

805
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,617
We'll be right across from you.

806
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,787
Give us a call on the radio
when you have her.

807
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,374
- We will.
- Well, good luck.

808
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,586
Let's go.

809
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,169
How are they gonna
get Amanda up here?

810
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,422
Ambush! Ambush!

811
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,468
Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!
Where is she?

812
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:01,474
There she is. I can see her.
It ain't the way it is!

813
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,144
Someone hit Cheese!

814
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,292
- You sure you heard something?
- Yes!

815
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,856
- Over there!
- What happened?

816
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,609
I don't know. I heard a splash.
Down there!

817
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,735
Somebody took Cheese out,

818
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,070
- and then all hell broke loose.
- Where's Amanda?

819
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,404
- Shots were fired from over there.
- I don't know!

820
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,610
Something went in the water!

821
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,656
- What?
- You sure you heard something?

822
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,033
- Yeah, something went in, but I...
- Where did it go?

823
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,534
There! Right there!

824
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,994
Oh, my God.

825
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,038
Oh, no.

826
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,135
Jesus Christ!

827
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,229
Paging Dr Goldsburn.
Dr Goldsburn to ICU.

828
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,878
- Hi.
- Hi.

829
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,799
- How's the leg?
- It'll be fine.

830
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,804
They find anything?

831
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:10,936
- They got divers in there now.
- She could still be alive.

832
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,775
Maybe she's hiding.
She could be stuck.

833
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,027
Right?

834
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,615
I don't think so.

835
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,092
Hey...

836
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,261
he's ever seen in all his years,

837
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:48,349
on a little girl called Amanda
and a doll named Mirabelle.

838
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,393
This quarry is extremely deep
and treacherous.

839
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:56,607
All too often,
she keeps that which she takes in.

840
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,985
- A sad end to that story, Suzanne.
- It sure is, Phil.

841
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,572
And Ron is next with sports.
The Bruins in action tonight?

842
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,074
Yes, they are, Phil.

843
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,992
The B's took a crack
at the Flyers tonight,

844
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,161
and the rough stuff started
in the first period.

845
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,915
And like that, she was gone.

846
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,421
We gave our statements.
Nick and Remy the same.

847
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,134
All of us spared any blame
for Amanda's death.

848
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,095
Jack Doyle resigned on the condition

849
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,306
that he and he alone
be held accountable.

850
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,060
The legendary captain of a unit
dedicated to children

851
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,813
stepped down today
in the aftermath of controversy.

852
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,941
He was granted
the dignity of early retirement.

853
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,903
But the humiliation of half a pension.

854
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,535
It was an ignominious end
to an illustrious career.

855
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,581
Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,
from what they could tell,

856
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,668
he ran into someone who wanted
the money more than he did.

857
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,878
Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen
was gunned down last night

858
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,505
in an apparent robbery.

859
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,841
The police commissioner
defended the rising tide of crime

860
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,760
as a statistical aberration tied
to growing unemployment

861
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,887
and the humidity of...

862
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,770
Enough time went by
and they called off the search.

863
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,565
They issued Helene
a death certificate.

864
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,625
The frame and the casket were
donated by the funeral home,

865
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,298
but had to be returned
at the end of the afternoon.

866
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,678
You know I love you, right?

867
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,180
Yeah.

868
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,267
I just wanna be alone for a while.

869
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,487
I don't know if she blamed me
or if she blamed herself.

870
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,993
But when she didn't think I was home,

871
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,537
or if she thought I couldn't hear,

872
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,290
she would cry.

873
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:30,010
I couldn't stop running it over
and over and over in my mind,

874
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,639
the vague and distant suspicion

875
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,683
that we never understood
what happened that night,

876
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,519
what our role was.

877
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,796
Or maybe it was just that,
like the hundreds of other children

878
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,652
who disappear each year
and never return...

879
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:53,200
Amanda was even more haunting
for never being found.

880
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,207
What they did find
was another big story,

881
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,585
and I couldn't help but find it strange.

882
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:09,675
Not two months later and not far away,
another child went missing.

883
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,519
And community watch patrols
are being formed.

884
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:15,556
A bicycle left roadside.
A tyre left spinning.

885
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,349
Late-breaking news on that story.

886
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,810
Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing

887
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,020
what this reporter believes
might be a sign.

888
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,023
Johnny Pietro was wearing the
medallion of St. Christopher,

889
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,233
patron saint of...

890
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,361
Johnny Pietro and his medallion.

891
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,115
What I didn't find strange
was this time,

892
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,576
no relatives came knocking
on our door.

893
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,914
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi.

894
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,417
- I need you to come on a ride with me.
- Where?

895
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,752
To Everett.

896
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,005
- What, no parties in Lynn?
- Funny.

897
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,300
- You got your toast with you, right?
- My what?

898
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,135
Your gun, dummy.

899
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,262
Yeah.

900
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:09,067
This ain't no
strip-clubbing in Lynn, Patrick.

901
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,237
I got something better for you, buddy.

902
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,753
You asked me to find
some people for you.

903
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,713
I think I found them.

904
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,839
What you getting me into?

905
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,926
You don't give a fuck about this
Corwin Earle dude no more?

906
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,262
Yo, 'cause the fat bitch
and the old dude are in there.

907
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,265
My man didn't know about the diddler.

908
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,975
Come in with me. Watch my side.

909
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,187
We'll find out
if this motherfucker's in there.

910
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,980
You know what, Patrick?

911
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,690
If you don't wanna come in,
you don't have to come in.

912
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,318
If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.

913
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,657
Let's go.

914
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,685
Guess who?

915
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,604
- Jerome Miller?
- No, it's the coke fairy.

916
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,523
- Open up.
- I got the money right here.

917
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,859
Marmaduke, you think you're gonna
hand me money on a fucking porch?

918
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,695
Open the door.

919
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,154
Who's he?

920
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,991
He's your father.
Open the fucking door!

921
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,204
- Look out.
- Okay, man!

922
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,164
Chill! Chill!

923
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,593
What are you guys, starting a band?

924
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,845
No one's starting a band.

925
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,560
It's a taste.

926
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,854
Cocaine for the old man.

927
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,356
Fucking Christ.

928
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,694
Want me to change
a roll of quarters for you, too?

929
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,588
I told you to tell me when they got here!

930
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,326
They just got here.

931
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,370
- You already did some!
- It was a taste bag.

932
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,955
Sorry, love.

933
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,959
Here, count this fucking mess.

934
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,299
Where's the rest, man?

935
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,470
As soon as he's finished counting
that fucking mess you gave me.

936
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,440
- Mr Miller, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

937
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,193
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

938
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,321
- Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.
- Hey, relax, handsome.

939
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,697
Excuse me!

940
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,241
Where the fuck you think you're going?

941
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,577
Mr Miller, I'm warning you!

942
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,121
Stop!

943
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,253
Patrick, shoot this bitch.

944
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,760
You fat busted cunt.

945
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,764
You put a gun on me, you better use it.

946
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,350
Just give us the fucking wizza!

947
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,439
You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?

948
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,405
Who's this guy?

949
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,074
Corwin! Go back to your room!

950
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,118
It's not a party?

951
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,205
No, it's not a party.

952
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,543
How much money's there, Patrick?

953
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,128
Enough.

954
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,966
Want this?

955
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:13,520
What are you doing?
Pick up the fucking money.

956
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,901
At least two guns in the house.
Roberta's carrying hers.

957
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,237
- What else?
- Well, they're definitely high.

958
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,239
- On what?
- Cocaine.

959
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,283
Your friend tell you that, too?

960
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,868
SWAT'll be here in five minutes.

961
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,119
You're not gonna wait for them?

962
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,288
Did you or did you not tell me
you saw Corwin Earle

963
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,249
with the medallion of St. Christopher
around his fucking wrist?

964
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,625
I definitely saw Corwin Earle.

965
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,753
We're not waiting.

966
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,547
Stay here.
And don't fuck around, all right?

967
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,965
Good job.

968
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,387
Fuck.

969
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,775
An... An officer... Shots are fired!
An officer down... Shots...

970
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,943
Listen to me!

971
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,571
A police officer has been shot
at 33 German Road!

972
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,163
Get away from him!

973
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,847
It was an accident.

974
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,567
It was an accident.

975
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,899
Wait!

976
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,722
Hey.

977
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,603
You okay?

978
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,482
They told me what happened.

979
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,947
I'm proud of you.

980
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,786
That man killed a child.

981
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,456
He had no right to live.

982
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,754
- You're proud of me?
- Of course I am.

983
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,258
You did what you had to do.

984
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,098
Let's go home.

985
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,188
I gotta stay here awhile.

986
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,987
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

987
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,879
Thanks.

988
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,803
It was fucked up, right?

989
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,475
They tell you anything about Nick?

990
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,145
They said he could be okay.

991
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,314
I don't know.

992
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,236
They say how old that little boy was?

993
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,863
Seven.

994
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,159
Second grade.

995
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:30,248
Should be proud of yourself.
Most guys would've stayed outside.

996
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,710
I don't know.

997
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,753
What don't you know?

998
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:40,800
My priest says shame is God
telling you what you did was wrong.

999
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,636
Fuck him.

1000
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,182
Murder's a sin.

1001
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,852
Depends on who you do it to.

1002
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:54,480
That's not how it works. It is what it is.

1003
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,330
I planted evidence on a guy once,

1004
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,584
back in '95.

1005
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:17,045
We were paying $100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1006
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,839
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

1007
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,175
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1008
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,344
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1009
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,512
up in Columbia Point.

1010
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,432
We go in, me and Nicky.

1011
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:33,811
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1012
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,939
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

1013
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,901
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1014
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,696
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1015
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,740
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1016
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:49,160
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1017
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,747
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1018
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:56,459
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1019
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:59,712
But the kid's room, in the back,

1020
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,674
was spotless.

1021
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:07,720
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1022
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,640
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1023
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:14,185
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1024
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,771
There's no expression on his face,

1025
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,566
tears streaming down.

1026
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,738
He wants to tell me he just learnt
his multiplication tables.

1027
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,990
Christ.

1028
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,659
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1029
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,412
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1030
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:38,126
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1031
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,588
You're worried what's Catholic?

1032
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,799
I mean, kids forgive.

1033
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:49,053
Kids don't judge.

1034
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,431
Kids turn the other cheek.

1035
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,434
What do they get for it?

1036
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,686
So I went back out there,

1037
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,855
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1038
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,275
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1039
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,489
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1040
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,952
You gotta take a side.

1041
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,958
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1042
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,753
you're not on my side.

1043
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,317
If you see me coming, you better run,

1044
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,257
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1045
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,346
Easy.

1046
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,811
Don't feel easy.

1047
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,773
Is the kid better off without his father?

1048
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:43,733
Yeah.

1049
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,653
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1050
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,281
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1051
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,825
It's a war, man.

1052
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,953
Are we winning?

1053
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,040
No.

1054
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:08,299
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1055
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,303
No.

1056
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,933
Does that make you right?

1057
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,897
I don't know.

1058
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,441
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

1059
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,043
- Hey.
- Hi.

1060
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,880
How's Remy?

1061
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,134
He lied to me.

1062
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,346
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1063
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,223
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1064
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:00,393
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1065
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,645
He called him his "old pal."

1066
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,565
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1067
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:06,899
Patrick...

1068
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,944
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1069
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,196
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1070
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,742
Let it go.

1071
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,370
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1072
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,456
Amanda's dead.

1073
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,624
Let it go.

1074
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,050
Babe.

1075
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,179
Nick died.

1076
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,777
Left. Left.

1077
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,869
Mr Kenzie.

1078
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,122
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

1079
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,013
Amen.

1080
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,510
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1081
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,182
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1082
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,434
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1083
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,104
You know, too much rum.

1084
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,855
Yeah, like what?

1085
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:14,360
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

1086
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,780
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1087
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:22,868
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1088
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,707
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1089
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,544
What if I don't?

1090
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:35,047
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1091
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,594
Had lunch with him last week.

1092
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,845
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1093
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,388
Excuse me.

1094
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,182
Hey, Dev.

1095
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:49,061
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1096
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,272
I can't complain.

1097
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,774
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1098
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,652
Not here.

1099
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,114
If it's like that, then you're gonna
have to buy me lunch.

1100
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,909
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1101
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,705
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1102
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,498
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1103
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,083
Why'd he leave?

1104
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:14,712
Had a habit ofjust
rubbing people the wrong way.

1105
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,881
Like what? What'd he do?

1106
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,383
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1107
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,551
Come on.

1108
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,345
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1109
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,389
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

1110
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,892
So, what happened?

1111
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,645
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1112
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:31,810
and puts in for a transfer.

1113
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:32,897
What, to Doyle?

1114
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:36,651
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1115
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:40,196
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

1116
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,114
What's "dirty"?

1117
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,994
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1118
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,539
Yeah. Why?

1119
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,167
Look, man. CSl is killing us out here.

1120
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,754
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibres are.

1121
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,631
Certain people are workers.

1122
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,341
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1123
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,593
So they don't mind it.

1124
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:08,265
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1125
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,144
He lied to me.

1126
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,480
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1127
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:17,191
that's small enough not to matter.

1128
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,823
All right, look.

1129
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:28,369
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1130
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,455
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

1131
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,581
Yeah.

1132
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,626
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1133
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,129
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1134
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,422
So what?

1135
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,257
So my informant tells me,

1136
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:44,844
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1137
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,972
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1138
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,974
How'd he know that?

1139
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,935
Let me tell you something.

1140
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,061
You better think long and hard

1141
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,148
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1142
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:02,027
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1143
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,532
Thanks for the steak.

1144
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,993
All right.

1145
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,758
Hey.

1146
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,344
I got it.

1147
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,847
We need to talk to you, Lionel.

1148
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,348
About what?

1149
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,185
About the acoustics in your apartment.

1150
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,811
What?

1151
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,772
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

1152
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,690
I got nothing to talk about.

1153
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,860
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

1154
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,197
Meet me at Murphy's Law.

1155
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,468
I don't meet him down Murphy's,
he's gonna call the staties.

1156
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:09,887
He's putting a move on you.
Don't go down there.

1157
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,056
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

1158
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,902
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

1159
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,893
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

1160
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,061
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

1161
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:19,480
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1162
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,899
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

1163
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:26,612
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

1164
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:55,266
How long have you known Remy?

1165
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,477
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1166
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,814
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1167
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,899
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1168
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,446
How long you known Remy?

1169
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,657
What is this?

1170
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,702
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1171
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,121
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1172
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,665
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1173
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,375
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1174
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,501
I'm not.

1175
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:25,296
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1176
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,922
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1177
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,527
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1178
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,469
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1179
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,805
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1180
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,682
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1181
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,684
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1182
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,228
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1183
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,189
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1184
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,484
I haven't been honest with you.

1185
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,529
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1186
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,490
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1187
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:54,783
The other guy cracked his skull.

1188
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,328
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1189
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,790
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1190
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,627
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1191
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,588
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1192
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,340
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1193
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,675
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1194
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,012
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1195
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,931
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1196
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,849
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1197
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,517
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1198
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:25,564
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1199
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,818
Why would I do that?

1200
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,905
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1201
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,991
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1202
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,035
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1203
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,287
you're just like everybody else.

1204
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,247
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1205
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,916
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1206
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,126
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1207
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,545
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1208
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,756
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1209
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,133
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1210
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,510
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1211
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:55,636
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1212
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,346
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1213
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,639
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1214
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,849
Can I get some service?

1215
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,267
Yeah.

1216
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,442
What?

1217
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,197
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1218
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,740
Thank you.

1219
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,077
Just give me a second.

1220
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:54,278
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1221
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,292
Go.

1222
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,632
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1223
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,471
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

1224
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:21,715
They didn't know I was there.

1225
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,267
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1226
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,980
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1227
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,149
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1228
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,984
What's the monkey gonna do?

1229
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,402
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1230
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,655
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1231
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,157
So I called Remy and told him.

1232
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,910
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

1233
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,661
And then what?

1234
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,500
We took her.

1235
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,089
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

1236
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,008
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1237
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:00,177
then we put her back. You know?

1238
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,262
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1239
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,847
My sister learns a lesson.

1240
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,017
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1241
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,020
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1242
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,688
They were gonna handle the cops.

1243
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,941
But Bea, she went nuts.

1244
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,610
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

1245
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,094
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1246
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,033
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1247
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:27,287
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1248
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,040
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

1249
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,710
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1250
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,799
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

1251
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:42,302
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

1252
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,346
Panicking.

1253
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,309
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

1254
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,061
She fell in.

1255
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,148
She's gone.

1256
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,400
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1257
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,694
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1258
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:04,241
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1259
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,910
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1260
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:12,082
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1261
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,420
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1262
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,339
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1263
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,175
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1264
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,010
Two hours.

1265
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,431
Amanda literally roasted.

1266
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,225
She was three.

1267
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:37,274
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1268
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:42,946
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1269
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,118
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1270
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,788
Like a fucking pot roast.

1271
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,293
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1272
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,130
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

1273
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,052
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

1274
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:10,641
Everybody needs to shut up and stay
calm. On the floor. On the floor!

1275
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,407
- Hands on your head. Do it.
- Oh, my God.

1276
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,061
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

1277
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:17,105
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

1278
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,525
Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

1279
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,072
What did you say?

1280
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,866
You're a talker, huh?

1281
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,493
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

1282
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,662
Don't antagonise him. He's got a gun.

1283
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:35,082
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

1284
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,000
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

1285
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,525
Shut the fuck up, for Christ's sake.

1286
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,338
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

1287
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:42,756
Close your eyes.

1288
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,966
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

1289
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,343
Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant.

1290
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,179
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

1291
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,056
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
- Remy Bressant.

1292
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,683
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

1293
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:53,850
Amanda McCready was taken

1294
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,018
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

1295
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,623
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

1296
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,108
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

1297
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,026
Remy, please.

1298
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,736
Please.

1299
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,881
Are you all right?

1300
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,092
Stay with him.

1301
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,239
Drop your gun.

1302
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,659
Put it down!

1303
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:42,918
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1304
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,096
What did you do?

1305
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,473
Did you get her killed?

1306
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,019
Say yes.

1307
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:07,317
Say yes.

1308
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:09,736
Say yes!

1309
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:14,825
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:31,174
She was a child.

1311
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,220
I love children.

1312
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:15,677
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1313
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:20,599
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1314
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,061
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1315
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:28,815
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1316
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,067
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1317
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,819
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1318
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,112
Whoa, hold on.

1319
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:36,615
You charge people money
as a detective.

1320
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:40,619
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1321
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,622
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1322
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:46,082
You're baffled. Right?

1323
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:52,088
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1324
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,425
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1325
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:57,344
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

1326
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:59,638
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1327
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:00,805
put in my mailbox.

1328
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,934
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

1329
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,101
A 911 call?

1330
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,230
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1331
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,606
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1332
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,733
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1333
01:32:11,817 --> 01:32:13,610
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1334
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,570
and there was a call.

1335
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,572
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1336
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,450
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1337
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:25,121
So, did you hear a tape?

1338
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,792
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1339
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,086
Did you see a transcript?

1340
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,385
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1341
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,105
Kids forgive.

1342
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,648
What do they get for it?

1343
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:54,150
Amanda literally roasted.

1344
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:04,661
You think I don't miss her.

1345
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,163
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1346
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,374
I love children.

1347
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:18,133
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1348
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,137
Are you sure?

1349
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,222
No.

1350
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,936
Are you coming?

1351
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,855
No.

1352
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,244
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana back in '72.

1353
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:49,039
Care to read the highlighted portion?

1354
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:03,053
Taking a trip?

1355
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,888
Patrick Kenzie.

1356
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,267
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1357
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,978
Remy Bressant died last night.

1358
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,565
I was told. It's a shame.

1359
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:21,571
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1360
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,490
He was a good man.

1361
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:27,494
We don't know
why people do what they do.

1362
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:30,163
Everybody looks out his own window.

1363
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,582
And everyone's got their reasons.

1364
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:44,678
- Hey.
- Hi.

1365
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,054
- How are you?
- Good.

1366
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:48,181
Nick! They're firing at me.

1367
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:49,933
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1368
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,184
Remy!

1369
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:53,520
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1370
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:56,481
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1371
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,566
Panicking.

1372
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,444
Amanda got scared.
She started running.

1373
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,447
She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.

1374
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:11,579
Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen
was gunned down last night

1375
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:12,914
in an apparent robbery.

1376
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:16,084
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1377
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:17,335
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1378
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,628
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1379
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:19,754
Don't go down there.

1380
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,506
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1381
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,716
I got no problem doing the time.

1382
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,218
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1383
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:26,594
- All right.
- I got things to protect, too.

1384
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,930
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me

1385
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,223
and you're a danger to Amanda.

1386
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,434
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

1387
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,602
I told him. Remy, please.

1388
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,942
So now you know.

1389
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:44,320
My sister's not stable. She's on crack.

1390
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,489
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1391
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,783
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1392
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,952
We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.

1393
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,620
Bigot. Drug mule.

1394
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,749
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1395
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,460
- What about the uncle?
- He can never tell anyone.

1396
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:01,963
Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.

1397
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:06,009
It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.

1398
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:09,095
Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.

1399
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,933
How many children
have we seen destroyed?

1400
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,186
Enough.

1401
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,856
Does it make you feel better?

1402
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:24,027
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1403
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,446
That you took her to be saved.

1404
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,364
From her own mother?

1405
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:33,745
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1406
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,333
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1407
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:41,127
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1408
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:45,131
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1409
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,551
You turn around.

1410
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,889
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1411
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,810
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1412
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,190
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in 10.

1413
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:05,068
Thought you would've
done that by now.

1414
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:09,572
You know why you haven't?

1415
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,411
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

1416
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:20,166
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1417
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,293
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1418
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:26,256
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

1419
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,341
And you always will.

1420
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:35,265
You... You could do a right thing here.

1421
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,100
A good thing.

1422
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,228
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1423
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,188
You walk away from it,

1424
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,566
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1425
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,984
You may not regret it for a year,

1426
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,779
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1427
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,951
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

1428
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,290
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

1429
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,836
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1430
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:08,047
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

1431
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:12,302
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1432
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,806
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1433
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,600
is have to apologise
to a grown woman

1434
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:19,767
who comes to me and says,

1435
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:21,936
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1436
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:24,230
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1437
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:27,859
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

1438
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:30,737
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1439
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,656
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1440
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:38,661
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1441
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,916
"They stole me.

1442
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,711
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1443
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:50,006
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1444
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:53,259
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1445
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,845
but I'll never forgive myself.

1446
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:04,687
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

1447
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:10,026
All right. For me, too.

1448
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:17,951
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

1449
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,455
I'm begging you.

1450
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,587
You think about it.

1451
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:40,598
She's happy.

1452
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:43,726
What?

1453
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:47,063
She's happy here. I saw her.

1454
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,109
Angie, don't do this.

1455
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:54,195
If you call the police,
they will send her back.

1456
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:57,407
I'm not sending her anywhere.
Helene is her mother.

1457
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,993
She's better off here.

1458
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:03,913
Why? Because he's got money,
and he makes her sandwiches?

1459
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,999
Because he loves her.

1460
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,419
- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

1461
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,421
Well, maybe she'll change.

1462
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:13,715
She won't change.
People don't change.

1463
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:15,383
Helene is arsenic.

1464
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:17,677
Angie, I know that this is hard.

1465
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:20,096
Look at me, I know it's hard.

1466
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:24,434
But I need you to stand by me.
I need you to say,

1467
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:25,643
"We're gonna make the right decision,

1468
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:26,936
"and we're gonna
make everything okay."

1469
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:29,147
Everything will be okay.

1470
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:30,356
Because we're gonna leave her here,

1471
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:32,567
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

1472
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:35,778
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

1473
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:39,907
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

1474
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:42,326
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

1475
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:45,371
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

1476
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,667
Baby, I'm sorry.

1477
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:53,379
But you can't ask me
to do something that I can't do.

1478
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,302
And you can't ask me to live with it.

1479
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:04,807
Patrick, for me. Please?

1480
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:14,317
I will hate you for doing this,
and I don't want to.

1481
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,241
Once an icon ofjustice
and a model for crusaders,

1482
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:48,953
Jack Doyle is behind bars tonight.
Evelyn?

1483
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:51,038
Social Services, as demanded by law,

1484
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:55,543
will take time to examine little Amanda
before returning her to home,

1485
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,712
and the arms of a mother
who never gave up hope

1486
01:42:57,796 --> 01:43:00,590
that she would see
her daughter again.

1487
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:08,139
- Helene, how do you feel...
- Helene, what does it feel like

1488
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:10,057
- to have your daughter with you now?
- How do you feel?

1489
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,893
Helene, how you feeling right now?
How you feeling...

1490
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:15,646
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

1491
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:18,024
Amanda, how do you feel
to see your mom?

1492
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:19,775
Hey, Amanda.

1493
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:21,736
Helene, how you feeling?

1494
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,863
- Tell us how it feels.
- Tell us what you're thinking right now.

1495
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:24,989
You must be so excited.
Give us your feelings.

1496
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:26,157
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh, my.

1497
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:28,964
Helene, the whole world wants to know
what you're feeling right now.

1498
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,537
How are you, sweetheart?

1499
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,664
Oh, my heart is brimming.

1500
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:40,129
And just God bless to everyone
and thank you to all...

1501
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:43,341
To all the policemen and the firemen,

1502
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,093
I feel like 9/11 right now.

1503
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:49,639
Oh, I swear to God, I mean, just...

1504
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,766
Do you have any comments
for parents out there

1505
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:53,226
that might be in a similar situation?

1506
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,937
Oh, just never let your kids
out of your sight.

1507
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:57,730
Don't trust them to no one.

1508
01:43:57,814 --> 01:44:00,900
And just keep them in your arms,

1509
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:04,111
as much as they're in your heart,
you keep them in your arms.

1510
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,948
How about that?
A great end to that story.

1511
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:09,867
- Good news for everybody.
- Yes, it is.

1512
01:44:34,142 --> 01:44:37,812
- Sorry, I had to get some stuff.
- It's all right.

1513
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:43,484
You wanna talk for a minute?

1514
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:49,031
There's nothing to say.

1515
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:55,348
Sorry for being rude, I gotta be
out of here in, like, two minutes.

1516
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:57,224
Do your thing.

1517
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,694
- Think he'll like me?
- Who?

1518
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,112
My date.

1519
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,199
Oh, how could he not?

1520
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:15,451
You're sweet.

1521
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,703
He seen me on my American Victim.

1522
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,790
He wrote me letters,
I was like, "Whatever."

1523
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:24,794
But then he seen my Meredith Vieira,
he drove down here from Providence.

1524
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,880
I'm like, "That's romantic. " Right?

1525
01:46:27,964 --> 01:46:29,382
How's your girlfriend?

1526
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,467
She's all right,
she's at the North Shore with her sister.

1527
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,220
Oh, hope she got
better family than I do, right?

1528
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:36,597
Those dirty motherfuckers.

1529
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:43,437
She don't get smart, I'll take you out.

1530
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:48,067
- How's Bea?
- Fuck Bea.

1531
01:46:48,151 --> 01:46:50,236
I banned her from the apartment.

1532
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,407
She sold her unit,
moved out fancy-pants Melrose.

1533
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,576
Don't think she don't hate you
for Lionel going to jail, neither.

1534
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,581
Well, that's probably
why she never paid my bill.

1535
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:01,914
You should fucking sue.

1536
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:04,166
How about you, Helene?

1537
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:06,919
You hate me?

1538
01:47:07,003 --> 01:47:08,671
Fuck no.

1539
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,842
Brother or not, he took my kid.
Fuck Lionel. She could have been hurt.

1540
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,970
- What about Amanda?
- What about Amanda?

1541
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:20,850
- Who's gonna watch her?
- Dottie.

1542
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:23,436
Yeah, does Dottie know that?

1543
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,272
- She will in five minutes.
- Great.

1544
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:30,818
Fuck, I'm gonna be late, too.
Unless you don't mind sitting for her.

1545
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:36,490
- Yeah, sure.
- For real?

1546
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:40,619
- Yeah, that's fine.
- She likes you.

1547
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,208
Bye, sweetheart.

1548
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,502
You're a godsend, Patrick.

1549
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:51,839
Bye.

1550
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:11,692
Is that Mirabelle?

1551
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:14,862
Annabelle.
