Oh, no!

38
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,982

He's in your corner!
Get out of the corner!

46
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:18,438
Another left to the body.
Another right to the head.

47
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,483
- A vicious combination!
- Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah!

48
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:28,282
And he looks like he's going down!
He hits the canvas.

49
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,869
Four, five...

50
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:35,455
It doesn't look like
he's gonna get up.

Everybody stand down!
Stand down!

Get outta here! Everybody!

73
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,983
They wanna toss my cell, Jimmy.
They're gonna find my manuscript.

74
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,238
That book is the only thing
I got left in here.

75
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:53,825
You understand me? That's the only
chance I got to get out of here.

76
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:57,037
I lose that, they gonna lose too.

77
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:00,541
Rubin, who do you think the first man
through this door has gotta be now?

78
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,087
It's me.

79
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,172
- Listen...
- All right. Tell 'em to come on in here.

80
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,132
- And line 'em up. - What if...
- Line 'em up, Jimmy.

81
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,426
Rubin, listen to me now.
What if that manuscript...

82
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,512
wasn't in this cell
when we tossed it?

83
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,722
What if it was stuffed
down your pants or something...

84
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,141
stuffed in your crotch,
and we couldn't see it?

85
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:21,103
I can make sure
you weren't strip-searched, okay?

86
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,313
Don't bullshit me.

87
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,733
No bullshit.
You have my word.

88
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:32,990
Ain't nobody putting
their hands on me, Jimmy.

89
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,534
Ain't nobody gonna touch me.

90
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,661
All right.

91
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,122
Nobody touches you.

92
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,211
You think I killed them people?

93
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,966
I don't know, Rubin.

94
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,845
I don't know.

95
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,953

All right. All right.
Just relax. Let me handle this.

99
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,009
Okay.

100
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:19,012
- Licence and registration.
- It's on the steering post.

101
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,223
What's goin' on?

102
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,058
Aw, shit, Hurricane.
Didn't realize it was you.

103
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,227
Yeah, it's me.
What's goin' on, Theo?

104
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:28,188
We're lookin' for two negroes
in a white car.

105
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:31,942
- Any two will do?
- No...

106
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,621
Oh, sh...

107
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,337
Okay, get out.

108

All right. Let's go.

109

Come on.

110
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:14,359
- Check his vitals.
- It's clear.

111
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,779
- Air passage.
- Heart rate has changed.

112
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,365
Keep the chin up.
Keep the passage open.

113
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:24,745
Can he talk, Doc?

114
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:28,040
- Just for a moment.
- Would you raise his head?

115
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:44,598
Can you make out these two men?
Are these the two men who shot you?

116
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:51,146
Look carefully, sir.
Are these the two men who did it?

117
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,696
- He said no.
- Move closer.

118
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:01,990
- He said no.
- Move closer!

119
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,920
Take another look, sir.

120
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,509
Son of a bitch.

121
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:23,512
Sir, look closer.

122
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,807
You sure these aren't the men?

123
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:30,310
- Dirty son of a bitch.
- Watch your mouth!

124
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:37,943
- Same old shit, huh, Della Pesca?
- Shut up!

125
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,779
Ask him again.

126
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:44,992
You been after me
my whole life, Della Pesca.

127
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:47,077
Now you're trying to pin
a murder jacket on me, huh?

128
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:51,582
Well, I got news for you.
It don't fit.

129

I'm gonna take your black ass down...

130

Mr Fuckin' Champion of the World.

131

I got your black fuckin' champion

00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:53,412
Yeah, well, I like the summers
in Brooklyn better.

156
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,290
Is all these people out here
freezing their butts off to buy books?

157
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,876
- That's right.
- Lined up like this...

158
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,086
not for a movie
or a ball game or somethin'?

159
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:04,506
- Ain't it great?
- No, "isn't it." "Isn't it great?"

160
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,717
Very good.
I stand corrected, Les.

161
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,636
Used books,
books nobody wants any more.

162
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,638
Aw, that's the great thing
about books, you know.

163
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:15,517
Once you use 'em, you can pass 'em
along to somebody else like a torch...

164
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,187
or a football,
you know, something you pass.

165
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, bring it on in.

166
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,817
Put it down.
Good, good. Down.

167
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:17,788
Okay, young man,
that'll be 25 cents.

168
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:20,624
- Jesus.
- Twenty-five cent?

169
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,501
Mustn't be much of a book.

170
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,587
- <i>Ah, listen, everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

171
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:28,298
<i>Especially you, girl</i>

172
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,634
So, Lesra, what'd you get?

173
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,011
Uh, this.

174
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,014
- What is it?
- I don't know. It's about a boxer.

175
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:39,726
It's got like 337 pages,
though, you know.

176
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,729
Well, it probably takes a lot of words
to tell someone's life story, eh?

177
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,773
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, well, this guy must be...

178
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,318
like 150 years old, you know,
if he gon' use all these words.

179
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,487
You know what, Les? Sometimes
we don't pick the books we read.

180
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:54,116
- They pick us.
- <i>Somebody, somewhere</i>

181
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:58,537
- <i>I tell you, it's unfair</i>
- <i>Can I get some whisky</i>

182
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,665
<i>Can I get some whisky</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

183
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:06,670
Mr Broden, we've been home schooling
this young man for eight months.

184
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:08,881
That's how it applies to us.

185
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,841
No, I'm not married.
Mr Swinton, who you spoke with...

186
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,218
is one of the two men I live with.

187
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,889
No, Sam Chaiton is
the other man I live with.

188
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,016
No, I don't think you do see,
Mr Broden.

189
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:21,018
They are my business partners
and my roommates.

190
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,769
And you're the Department
of Education...

191
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:26,023
and you're telling me you're prepared
to stop this young man's education...

192
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,735
because you can't find
some goddam high school records?

193
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,540
Yep, that's exactly
what I'm doing, Mr Broden.

194
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,585
No, no, I'm not asking you
to make an exception.

195
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,962
I'm asking you to do your job,
which is qualitatively different...

196
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,632
but I thank you for it anyway.

197
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:55,761
- Shit.
- Political Science 101, the art of gentle persuasion.

198
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,972
Never mind 101.
I need a smoke.

199
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,017
- So how was the book sale?
- Great.

200
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,936
- There.
- Did you get <i>The Other America?</i>

201
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:06,522
Uh, I couldn't find <i>The Other
America,</i> but I got you, uh...

202
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,691
Sam Robertson Davies, R.D. Laing.

203
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,236
- You don't want to piss me off today.
- It's a book sale, Lisa, not a library.

204
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:13,904
- Whatever.
- Hey, look, Lisa.

205
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:17,491
Got this one right here for 25 cent.
<i>The Sixteenth Round.</i>

206
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:20,410
- Oh, your first book, huh?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,788
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

208
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:30,462
Hurricane is the professional name
that I acquired later on in life.

209
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:33,715
Carter is the slave name
that was given to my forefathers...

210
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:37,386
who worked in the cotton fields
of Alabama and, and Georgia...

211
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,972
and was passed on to me.

212
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:43,517
The kindest thing I can say
about my childhood...

213
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,936
is that I survived it.

214
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:50,816
Paterson was a run-down town,
a poor and violent place.

215
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,569
The only way to survive
was to know how to handle yourself...

216
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,446
and I learned fast.

217
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,826
Come on! Hurry up!

218
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,829
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's get out of here!

219
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,838
Take this out.

220
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,884
Hey, Donnique, go for a swim!

221
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,057
Hello, boys.

222
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,314
Wanna see something?

223
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:34,693
Huh? Isn't that pretty?

224
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,656
You like that?

225
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,992
- What's your name?
- Donnique.

226
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,661
Donnique?

227
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:47,497
That's a pretty name, Donnique.

228
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,666
You wanna be good to me, sugar?

229
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:54,046
H-H-Hey, mister!
Leave him alone!

230
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:57,883
I wouldn't hurt your friend.
Would I?

231
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,721
You don't need
to be afraid, Donnique.

232
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,557
You're pretty.
How old are you?

233
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,100
- Ten.
- Ten?

234
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,770
I said, leave him alone!

235
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:16,485
Run! Run! Come on!

236
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:18,904
- Get outta here!
- Run!

237
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,407
You little bastard.

238
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,284
Let's get outta here!

239
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,080
You black bastard, you!
Goddam it!

240
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,457
Please, mister! Put me down!

241
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:35,087
- Shut up, you son of a bitch!
- Put me down!

242
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:38,465
Hey!

243
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,110
- I didn't... didn't do nothin'!
- Come on! Let's go!

244
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:00,195
- I didn't... I didn't...
- Shut up.

245
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,281
I didn't do nothin'.

246
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:09,079
- Come on, you...
- No!

247
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:13,792
- Get in there.
- I-It wasn't me.

248
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:20,174
I... I... didn't do nothin'!

249
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,594
Sit down, kid.

250
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,653
What have we got here?

251
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,822
It's a juvenile case.

252
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:47,659
He's a kid, Sarge.
He's only 11 years old.

253
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,041
It's a nigger with a knife.

254
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,336
I don't care how old he is.

255
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,713
Take care of him.

256
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,513
We know you were at the falls last week,
and we know what happened.

257
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,265
So you're gonna talk,
you little son of a bitch.

258
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,311
You'll be makin' speeches
when I get through with your black ass.

259
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,688
Ralph. Ralph.

260
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,330
I'm Sergeant Detective Della Pesca.

261
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,749
You wanna tell me what happened?

262
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,006
What is it, you were trying to rob
this man's gold watch...

263
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:47,678
and he fought back,
and so you stabbed him?

264
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,764
Is that pretty much it?

265
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:54,768
I-I... didn't do nothin'.

266
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:01,400
Let me tell you something, sunshine.

267
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,694
The man you stabbed...

268
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,905
is a very important member
of this community...

269
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:10,158
and you are goin' down.

270
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:15,789
Do you see?
And I am going to see to it personally.

271
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,753
As for you, Rubin Carter,
you're a menace to society.

272
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,464
If something isn't done
about you soon...

273
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,425
you'll become a dangerous man
in later life.

274
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:30,846
I only wish you were old enough
I could send you to state prison.

275
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,140
I therefore sentence you...

276
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:36,768
to the state home for boys
in Jamesburg...

277
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,397
from this day till you're
21 years of age.

278
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,900
- So be it.
- It's okay, son.

279
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,905
Jamesburg was a place of horror
that I would be forever sorry...

280
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:50,365
to have known existed.

281
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,369
It was there that I spent the next
eight years learning how to maim...

282
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:58,332
butcher and fight for my survival.

283
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:11,887
I don't get what's goin' on here.
I'm the boy's father.

284
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:15,516
I take care of him.
I don't know what you people...

285
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:18,810
I mean, what's it to you?

286
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,813
M-Mr Martin, we've gotten to know
Lesra over the past few weeks.

287
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,567
And I gotta tell you, he's got
more natural ability and enthusiasm...

288
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:29,404
than just about any kid
I've ever worked with.

289
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:33,450
So, when he told us
he wanted to go to college...

290
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:35,911
we just figured
that's the way it was gonna be.

291
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:39,164
Well, I know he's smart.

292
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,583
There's no doubt about that,
but, uh...

293
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,003
he can't read, Mrs Martin.

294
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,631
But we think that we could teach him.
I mean, within...

295
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:50,884
probably two years, with a lot of work,
we could get him ready for college.

296
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,637
- Yeah, well, that school sure not doin' it.
- Now wait just a second.

297
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,597
- I am that boy's father...
- But if they can give him more...

298
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,850
They're talkin' to me, Alma!

299
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,561
Uh, Mr Martin, you know,
we got plenty of room.

300
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:03,814
And if Lesra wants to learn,
then we can teach him.

301
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,774
If you don't want that, that's fine.
That's up to you.

302
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:09,528
But no one here is trying
to replace you, sir.

303
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:21,957
- This what you want, boy?
- I wanna go to college.

304
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:28,338
And if that's what it's gonna take,
then, yeah.

305
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,841
It don't seem right.

306
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,935
Why you gotta go, Lesra?

307
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:45,397
- Don't you want me to go, El?
- You should be here backin' me up.

308
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:48,609
Leave the boy, Elston.
Lesra goin' to Toronto now.

309
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:52,404
Got a job to do.
Wants to go to college.

310
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,751
After eight years at Jamesburg,
I escaped.

311
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:09,046
I was angry,
embittered with life.

312
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:11,757
I ran as if on a cloud...

313
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:15,719
unaware of how high I was stepping
or of anything else around me.

314
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:19,389
There was room in my head
for only one word...

315
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,559
one thought:

316
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:25,145
freedom.

317
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:29,691
I ran straight into the U.S. Army
and a pair of paratrooper wings...

318
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:31,652
and my whole life changed.

319
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:34,112
I learned that
knowledge of self and kind...

320
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,324
is the only true means
to the liberation of the black man.

321
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:40,327
I could do anything.
I overcame my stutter.

322
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:43,247
I became a prizefighter.
I came back to Paterson...

323
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:46,416
the all-Army European
welterweight champ.

324
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,669
Let me have a soda, please.

325
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:53,382
Judy, who's that fine soldier
standing over there at the bar?

326
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:04,017
Oh, he's a local boy.
Rubin Carter, I think.

327
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,609
Make it two.

328
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:20,701
- He's comin' over here.
- Uh-oh. Stay cool.

329
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,376
I'm back. I'm back.

330
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:33,672
- Mmm, so you missed me, did you?
- So tell me...

331
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,508
- Well, what do you want to know?
- You're in my seat.

332
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,471
Uh, you know, I'm from Georgia.

333
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:44,600
And I was thinkin'
that afterwards you and me...

334
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:50,898
You're in my seat, country.

335
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:54,484
I don't see your name anywhere.

336
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,321
That's 'cause you're blinded by
the ass-kickin' I'm about to put on you.

337
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:00,908
Now get up out of my seat.

338
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:03,285
- Hey, come on now. Take it easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:06,747
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Let that motherfucker go. - Just stop it. Listen.

340
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:09,166
- Not here. - You know what? I wanna dance.
You wanna come over here and dance with me?

341
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,169
- Not here.
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you. - Hmm?

342
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:14,713
Oh, you wanna fight,
or you wanna dance?

343
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,424
- He ain't worth it.
- Yeah, you wanna dance. Come on.

344
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:22,763
- Brother got a lot of hostility up in him.
- <i>Should I let myself go</i>

345
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,392
<i>In his direction</i>

346
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,939
- Come on, sweet thing. Let's dance.
- <i>Is his love strong enough</i>

347
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,318
<i>For my heart's protection</i>

348
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,284
- <i>I don't know</i>
- <i>I don't know, I don't know</i>

349
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:48,622
- <i>I don't know</i>
- <i>I don't know, I don't know</i>

350
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:51,667
- You dance nice.
- <i>But he loves me so good</i>

351
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,919
- <i>Till I think I should</i>
- Thank you.

352
00:27:57,714 --> 00:28:00,884
<i>If I gave him my heart</i>

353
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:05,264
- These hands were meant for more than just fighting.
- <i>Would he refuse it</i>

354
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:09,768
<i>Would he tear it apart</i>

355
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:17,526
- <i>Or tenderly use it</i>
- Her name was Mae Thelma.

356
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:22,406
- <i>I don't know</i>
- And she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen.

357
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:27,411
- <i>I don't know</i>
- <i>I don't know, I don't know</i>

358
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,788
<i>But he hugs me so tight</i>

359
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:32,082
<i>Till I think I might</i>

360
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:35,711
You got a girl around?

361
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:39,339
No. I ain't got no girl.

362
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,466
No?

363
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:46,680
Well, I had a good time
with you tonight.

364
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:53,020
- Mae Thelma, is that you?
- Yeah. Mama, I'll be right up.

365
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:57,858
- You gon' call me tomorrow?
- I'm gon' call you tonight.

366
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:00,444
- No, you can't call me tonight now.
- I'll call you tomorrow then.

367
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:02,738
You'll call me tomorr...

368
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:09,328
- Is that your father?
- No. My father's asleep.

369
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,790
- Your name Rubin Carter?
- Yeah.

370
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:16,168
- You're comin' with us.
- For what?

371
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,379
You heard the man.

372
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:30,265
What'd you think,
we weren't gonna find you?

373
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:35,771
You still owe me time.

374
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:50,869
<i>104, meet Vice officers</i>
<i>at Glory Park.</i>

375
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,102
All right. Get out.

376
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:20,232
- This way now.
- Okay.

377
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,742
From that moment on...

378
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,162
I decided to take control
of my life.

379
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,333
I made up my mind
to turn my body into a weapon.

380
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,978
I would be a warrior-scholar.

381
00:30:58,145 --> 00:31:00,480
I boxed. I went to school.

382
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:04,943
I began reading
W.E. B DuBois, Richard Wright.

383
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,823
Move, tier one! Move it!

384
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,628
So I gave up
all the worthless luxuries...

385
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:24,880
that most inmates crave...

386
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:29,176
the girlie books, fags,
cigarettes, the movies.

387
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:31,136
I hated them.

388
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,430
In fact, I hated everyone.
I didn't even speak English.

389
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:37,392
I spoke hate,
and its verbs were fists.

390
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,276
I made up my mind
to turn my body...

391
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:50,239
into a weapon that would
eventually set me free...

392
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:53,867
or kill anyone who sought
to keep me in prison.

393
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:12,177
On September 21, 1961...

394
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,639
I was released,
and I vowed upon everything holy...

395
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:19,309
never to come back to prison again.

396
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,986
I had spent almost half my time
on this Earth...

397
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,363
in jail.

398
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:54,052
Hey, come on, Lesra.
Time to get up. Breakfast, buddy.

399
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:59,308
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Yeah, I'm up. I'm up.

400
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:03,770
Did you get any sleep?
Your light's been on all night.

401
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:07,649
I just can't stop reading, man.
This book's about my life.

402
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:11,486
Jeez, Lisa, you gotta smoke
for breakfast?

403
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:28,462
- Do you know when we met in Brooklyn?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,884
Why'd you take me home?

405
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:38,597
Well, you know, you...
you met my folks, man...

406
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:43,268
and you brought me up here,
you did all this stuff for me.

407
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,354
Yeah.

408
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:47,940
No, I mean, why?

409
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,067
Why'd you do all that?

410
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:53,862
'Cause you were smart and funny.

411
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,991
And short. You know, we figured
it'd be good for you to...

412
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:00,118
spend a little time
with some tall white people.

413
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:04,164
- Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.
- What, did you do it 'cause I'm black?

414
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:07,835
And you thought
I couldn't do it myself?

415
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:12,548
'Cause Rubin... Rubin did it
all himself, you know.

416
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:16,093
Hey, Les, we didn't feel
sorry for you.

417
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,679
We met you and got to know you and realized
you could accomplish some things...

418
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:22,182
and, like a lot of us,
you could use some help.

419
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm sure that Hurricane Carter
had some help along the way.

420
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,900
- None of us does it alone.
- Hey.

421
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:36,446
As far as doin' it for yourself goes,
nobody can learn anything for you.

422
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:41,034
Trust me. Everything you're doing now,
you're doing for yourself.

423
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:47,875
I'll get it.

424
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:55,591
- You know, I been thinkin'.
- Yeah?

425
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:58,844
- How're you doing?
- About what?

426
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:01,430
No, no, no, he's here. He just...

427
00:35:01,597 --> 00:35:05,350
Think I wanna put up a heavy bag.
You know, like a big punching bag.

428
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,644
Uh, those renovations?
Probably the end of the month.

429
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,355
- Oh, any special reason?
- No. No, man.

430
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,524
I just feel like punchin'
something, you know?

431
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:15,319
That's it. It's set.

432
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,406
- A little low. A little low.
- Keep your hand up. Keep the left down.

433
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:23,202
Straight out of prison,
I was a fighting machine.

434
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:28,207
One thing I could do,
and the only thing, was box.

435
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:31,251
I had tasted my own blood...

436
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:33,837
and I loved it.

437
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,678
This is your ringside commentator.

438
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:43,639
Tonight's fight brings together...

439
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:47,184
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
from Paterson, New Jersey...

440
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:50,604
and Joey Cooper,
who is currently undefeated.

441
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:52,689
Yeah! Way to go, Hurricane!

442
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:56,485
Hit him!

443
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:03,200
And the champion, Joey Cooper,
seems to be helpless...

444
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:06,036
against Rubin Carter,
the challenger.

445
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:18,465
Yeah!

446
00:36:21,718 --> 00:36:24,763
And I'll tell ya, folks,
things are taking a surprising turn...

447
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,140
in this middleweight fight tonight.

448
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:30,602
Joey Cooper in big trouble.
Rubin Carter pourin' it on.

449
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:34,022
Left hook, right hook, uppercut... Oh!

450
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,000
He's down.
Oh, look at this.

451
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,294
What a disaster for Cooper.

452
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,506
Carter is punishing him.
He's gonna... Oh, he is down, folks.

453
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:02,634
He is down for the count,
and he is not getting up.

454
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:05,721
- Four, five, six...
- I'll tell you that right now.

455
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:08,140
- Get up! - seven...
- Get up now!

456
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,350
Right now!

457
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:12,936
You're out!

458
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:17,107
Unbelievable! Rubin Carter
comes on like a hurricane...

459
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:20,194
and defeats
the undefeated Joey Cooper...

460
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,030
in round one of
this middleweight fight.

461
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:25,616
- I don't believe it! Oh!
- Unbelievable upset tonight.

462
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:28,452
Have you ever seen anything like it?

463
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:32,122
- And the crowd is goin' wild here in Reading, Pennsylvania.
- You all right, Cooper?

464
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:37,419
- And Rubin Carter took this fight right
away from him here this evening. - I'm okay.

465
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:47,054
Mrs Carter, what do you think it's gonna be
like being married to such a ferocious fighter?

466
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:52,100
- Well, uh... - Well, it's gonna be a little
scary, but I'll try my best. All right.

467
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,313
Can you believe
that black son of a bitch?

468
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,026
He thinks he's champion of the world.
Fighter of the year, my ass.

469
00:38:01,193 --> 00:38:03,028
A low-life criminal.

470
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:08,283
<i>My mother told me</i>

471
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,414
<i>'Fore she passed away</i>

472
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,378
<i>Said, son, when I'm gone</i>

473
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:25,384
<i>Don't forget to pray</i>
<i>'cause there'll be hard times</i>

474
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:30,180
- What the hell do they expect? Of course a riot broke out.
- <i>Hard times</i>

475
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,391
Every time we try to stand up
and defend our own neighbourhoods...

476
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:35,060
they send the cops in
to bust us in our heads.

477
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:40,816
If you feel so strongly about all this,
Hurricane, why aren't you out there...

478
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:43,735
instead of sittin' in here drinkin'?

479
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:48,115
I'm drinkin' club soda, first of all, and I'm
in here because you asked me to be here.

480
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:51,326
But you're right.
Maybe I should go down there.

481
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,954
Yeah, maybe I should go grab my gun,
shoot me a half a dozen...

482
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,665
of them nigger-hatin' cops, huh?

483
00:38:56,832 --> 00:39:01,086
What you think, Bucky? I know I can get
me about five of'em before they get me.

484
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:06,341
Ed? Huh?

485
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:11,889
How about you?
You wanna come?

486
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:20,647
Shit. That's off the record,
by the way.

487
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:23,358
Oh, he knows that.
Don't you?

488
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:25,944
Sure, champ. Sure.

489
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,949
You betcha.

490
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,667
- Take that, champ!
- Get down.

491
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,299
- Right here.
- Rubin, what is this?

492
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:52,471
- Get down, get down! Stay down!
- Oh, Lord, what is... - Let's get outta here!

493
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:06,068
- You all right, T?
- Shh, it's okay.

494
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:09,112
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:11,198
Shh. It's okay.

496
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:14,326
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

497
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:18,121
- You all right?
- You know why they did this.

498
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:21,083
Shh. All right. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

499
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,795
- I told you it was off the record.
- Nothin' with you is off the record!

500
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:27,506
- Look, I don't want to go into it right now.
- You ain't had no business talkin' to them people.

501
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:29,383
- You know everything that you say...
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

502
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:30,843
- They gon' make up something different.
- Mae, what you want me to do, huh?

503
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:32,427
- What you want me to do?
- Why do you say these things?

504
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:34,930
- I know what they doin'. I know exactly what they doin'.
- Are you trying to get us killed?

505
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,933
So what you want me to do, huh?

506
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,520
You want me to roll over
and just lay dead?

507
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:44,648
- Pride. It ain't nothin' but pride!
- You're damn right it's pride.

508
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:47,359
- I'm guilty.
- Give me my baby.

509
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,488
Shit.

510
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,423
<i>You will not be able</i>
<i>to stay home, brother</i>

511
00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:15,179
<i>You will not be able to plug in</i>
<i>turn on and drop out</i>

512
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:19,224
<i>You will not be able</i> <i>to lose yourself on skag
and skip out</i> <i>for beer during commercials</i>

513
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,894

<i>The revolution will not be televised</i>

<i>The revolution will not be brought</i>
<i>to you by Xerox and ball parks</i>

516
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,529
<i>Without commercial interruptions</i>

517
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:37,367
<i>The revolution will not be right back</i> <i>after a message
about a white tornado</i> <i>white lightning or white people</i>

518
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:42,206
<i>You will not have to worry about a dove</i> <i>in your bedroom,
the tiger in your tank</i> <i>or the giant in your toilet bowl</i>

519
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:44,875
<i>The revolution</i>
<i>will not go better with Coke</i>

520
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,628
<i>The revolution will not fight germs</i>
<i>that may cause bad breath</i>

521
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:50,547
<i>- The revolution will put you</i> <i>in the driver's seat</i>

522
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:53,467
<i>The revolution will not be televised</i>
<i>Will not be televised</i>

523

brothers</i> <i>The revolution will be live</i>

525
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:06,688
Champion of the world!
Champion of the world!

526
00:42:10,984 --> 00:42:13,320
Yeah, they're still out.

527
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:37,052
I've seen a lot of things in my time,
but it's taken 35 minutes...

528
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:41,515
for these judges to tell us
what this home town crowd already knows.

529
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:45,143
Joey Giardello
is about to the lose the crown...

530
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,479
to Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.

531
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:57,573
Ladies and gentlemen...

532
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:00,117
it's a unanimous decision.

533
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:05,122
The winner
and still champion of the world...

534
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:07,457
Joey Giardello!

535
00:43:07,624 --> 00:43:10,669
Giardello!

536
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:16,633
No. No, no. No. No.

537
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:21,221
Hey. What?

538
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:24,266
- You've stolen it!
- Aw, shit!

539
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:28,562
- This is bullshit!
- What's goin' on here?

540
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:32,900
- Yes, yes!
- Boo!

541
00:43:41,074 --> 00:43:44,369
Well, all I can say
is these Philly judges...

542
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:46,747
must have been watching
a different fight...

543
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:51,210
because in the one we just saw,
Hurricane Carter took the title.

544
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:11,813
<i>Oh, now tell me</i>
<i>where can you party, child</i>

545
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,150
<i>- All night long</i>
<i>- In the basement</i>

546
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:17,277
<i>Down in the basement, yeah</i>

547
00:44:17,444 --> 00:44:21,323
<i>Oh, where can you go</i>
<i>when your money gets low</i>

548
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:25,035
<i>In the basement</i>
<i>Whoa, down in the basement</i>

549
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,331
<i>And if a storm is takin'place</i>
<i>you can jam and still be safe</i>

550
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:32,459
<i>- In the basement, down in the basement</i>
- I got somethin' special for you.

551
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:37,756
- Hey, Hurricane, how you doin'?
- Hey, champ.

552
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:40,592
<i>In the basement</i>
<i>Down in the basement</i>

553
00:44:40,717 --> 00:44:43,387
<i>- Oh, you got the comforts of home</i>
- Anybody call a cab?

554
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:46,431
<i>- A nightclub too</i>
<i>- In the basement</i>

555
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:49,434
<i>- Oh, down in the basement</i>
- Anybody call a cab?

556
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:52,062
I did, unless Rubin's
taking me home.

557
00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:54,773
Yeah, if I take you,
it ain't gonna be home.

558
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:59,653
Mr Carter. M-Mr Carter.

559
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,781
- Headed 'cross town, Mr Carter?
- Yeah. Why? You need a ride?

560
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:05,158
- Wo... Would you mind?
- No, I wouldn't mind.

561
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:08,912
- All right! Okay.
- Come on.

562
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:11,123
- You drive.
- Drive your car?

563
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,876
- Come on.
- Oh, shit!

564
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:18,130
My friends are never gonna believe
I was cruising with The Hurricane.

565
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:21,717
- You know, what we wanna know is, can we get his autograph?
- No. No, no.

566
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,388
Oh, shit.

567
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:29,558
Motherfuckers.

568
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:31,810
- John, you been drinkin'?
- No. - All right.

569
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:33,937
All right, just relax.
Let me handle this.

570
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:36,523
All right.

571
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,026
Licence and registration.

572
00:45:58,086 --> 00:46:01,924
It's okay. I got it.
You guys come with me.

573
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:17,731
B-E-L-L-O. Bello.

574
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:21,693
Bradley. B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.

575
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,779
Okay.

576
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,993
Are those the guys?

577
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,705
No?

578
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:36,208
Okay, let's go.

579
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,594
So what are you doing
around here at that hour?

580
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,222
Well, we was just out, you know,
takin' a walk, right?

581
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:53,684
- Yeah. Just gettin' a pack of cigarettes. That's it.
- Yeah.

582
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:57,271
Both of you are in big trouble.

583
00:46:57,437 --> 00:47:00,315
You're in violation
of your parole.

584
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:04,486
But I don't wanna talk
about the burglary.

585
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:07,823
We'll talk about
your parole problem later, Bello.

586
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:12,828
As far as I'm concerned...

587
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:15,873
no proof a burglary
really took place.

588
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,626
See what I mean?

589
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:28,886
Yeah, I see what you mean.

590
00:47:29,052 --> 00:47:31,471
I'm only interested
in the facts in this case...

591
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:34,516
and you and Bradley here are the only
two people that can really help me out.

592
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,768
Do you follow?

593
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,820
- Yeah, I follow.
- Good.

594
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:51,783
Now, is there any scenario
that you can imagine...

595
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:55,954
in which you could be sure...

596
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:59,333
really, positively sure...

597
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:02,044
that the man you saw that night...

598
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:07,049
was Rubin Carter?

599
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:26,360
Yeah, Rubin Carter. Yeah.

600
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:29,780
Wanna tell me again what happened?
You were there having a drink? What was that?

601
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:32,032
No, no, it was, uh...

602
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,077
- I was goin' out for a pack of cigarettes.
- Yeah.

603
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:38,872
I heard a couple of shots, then I saw these
two coloured guys, they come out of the bar.

604
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,625
And one of them was?

605
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,710
- One of them was Rubin Carter.
- Rubin Carter?

606
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,129
- Right, Rubin Carter, the fighter.
- Yeah, sure.

607
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:56,849
All rise.

608
00:48:58,517 --> 00:49:03,188
The court will come to order.
The Honourable Judge Larner presiding.

609
00:49:03,355 --> 00:49:05,691
Be seated.

610
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,616
The defendants will rise.

611
00:49:19,997 --> 00:49:22,207
Rubin Carter...

612
00:49:22,374 --> 00:49:25,961
although you still contend you are not
guilty of the crimes charged against you...

613
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:30,799
you were afforded a full and fair trial
by a jury of your peers.

614
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:35,971
Have you reached a verdict?

615
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:41,185
Yes, we have, Your Honour.

616
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:44,521
We, the jury, find the defendants,
Rubin Carter...

617
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:47,649
and John Artis,
guilty on all counts.

618
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:50,027
Oh, no!

619
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:53,572
- No!
- That ain't right! He's innocent!

620
00:49:58,202 --> 00:49:59,745
- Order.
- No!

621
00:49:59,912 --> 00:50:03,165
- Order in the court.
- No!

622
00:50:03,332 --> 00:50:07,252
- Order! Bailiff will see to it that order prevails.
- No! No!

623
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:10,172
This ain't right. Railroaded!

624
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:18,347
- No.
- Rubin Carter...

625
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:20,891
John Artis...

626
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,727
for the murder of James Oliver,
it is the court's sentence...

627
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:27,064
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

628
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:29,149
No!

629
00:50:29,316 --> 00:50:32,069
On the second count,
the murder of Fred Nauyaks...

630
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:35,906
you are sentenced to be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

631
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:38,158
No, God, no!

632
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:43,372
As to the third count involving
the murder of Hazel Tanis...

633
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:46,208
it is the sentence of this court
that you be imprisoned...

634
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:49,086
for the remainder
of your natural life.

635
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,727
Okay, Carter, let's go.

636
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,813
Take it easy.

637
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,315
You're a tough guy.

638
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:16,113
He thinks he's gonna stay in a room,
and that's it.

639
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:24,413
Put your clothes, your shoes, your ring, your
watch and whatever else you've got in that bag.

640
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,667
You are being issued a standard inmate
uniform with your number sewn on it...

641
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:32,171
so that we can identify you
immediately.

642
00:51:32,337 --> 00:51:34,882
And you'll go to have your facial hair
shaved. You know the rules.

643
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,343
No, I can't do it, Warden.

644
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:41,847
I beg your pardon?

645
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:44,975
I cannot do it.

646
00:51:45,142 --> 00:51:49,855
Look, you have legal custody
over my body...

647
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:52,191
but I'm innocent.

648
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:56,737
I've committed no crime.
The crime's been committed against me.

649
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:01,533
And I will not wear the clothes
of a guilty man.

650
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,495
Now, I'll go anywhere you want me to go
in this penitentiary, Warden...

651
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:09,625
but you let it be known
in no uncertain terms...

652
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:15,047
that any man who tries
to put his hands on me...

653
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:18,842
This place is where we
tell you the rules.

654
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:21,178
You hear that?

655
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:26,183
Do you understand me?

656
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,852
Do you?

657
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:33,232
Because if you do,
you had better strip right now...

658
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:36,485
and put on that fucking uniform.

659
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:45,452
I can't do that.

660
00:52:48,247 --> 00:52:50,958
Put this man in the hole.

661
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:53,669
Give him sufficient time
to reflect...

662
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:56,713
on how he intends to behave
in this institution.

663
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,968
Ninety days.

664
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:25,284
Hey, Bobby,
we've got another one for ya.

665
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:46,096
I like your suit.

666
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:53,705
Three, two...

667
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:56,625
one.

668
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:59,127
Lights-out.

669
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:02,673
You see?

670
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:08,637
"Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

671
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,931
There's doubt.

672
00:55:11,098 --> 00:55:14,518
The shadow is doubt.
The shadow is doubt.

673
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:21,650
But you're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me.

674
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,152
Lights-out.

675
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,867
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

676
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:32,995
You can't break me
'cause you didn't make me.

677
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:36,373
You understand? Huh?

678
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:47,593
You fucked everything up for everybody,
Rubin. It's all fucked-up.

679
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,226
Who's that?

680
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,481
Y'all ain't got no speakers in here.
Who is that?

681
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:08,113
I put us into this situation
any goddam way...

682
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,616
motherfucker.

683
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:15,162
I done fucked everything up for everybody.
You know, that shit that's all fucked up.

684
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:19,875
What the fuck they expect us
to do now, huh? Motherfucker.

685
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:28,967
I'm s... I'm s... I'm scared.

686
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:35,807
Just shut up. Shut the fuck up,
you little skinny motherfucker.

687
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:38,852
You think your father used to beat
your little stuttering ass?

688
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:42,147
Don't make me
jump over there on ya.

689
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:45,817
No, you shut up.
Just shut the fuck up, talkin' to me.

690
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,570
Fuck you talkin' to? You ain't...
You ain't telling me what to say.

691
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:51,114
I'm running shit around here.
Fuck is wrong?

692
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:53,200
Ain't nobody runnin' shit.
I'm runnin' shit.

693
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:55,702
Shut the fuck up!

694
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,544
What you say?

695
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,172
No. No.

696
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:11,385
What are we gonna do now?

697
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:14,888
Huh?

698
00:57:15,055 --> 00:57:17,850
I don't know what.

699
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:20,477
Shit, ain't nobody touchin' me.
No goddam soul touchin' me.

700
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:23,772
Put your hands on me not twice. You
better not put your fuckin' hands on me.

701
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:26,275
- I got...
- Shut up!

702
00:57:48,714 --> 00:57:53,844
Oh, yeah. There's our man.
I can feel the hate. Can you feel it?

703
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:58,056
You can feel the hate, Rubin.
Don't you wanna just hurt somebody?

704
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,601
I feel like
I wanna kill somebody...

705
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:03,896
'cept there ain't nobody
in here to kill.

706
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:08,192
'Cept you, boy.

707
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:12,279
How 'bout it, Rube?

708
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:17,868
Get away from me!

709
00:58:52,152 --> 00:58:54,821
All right, Carter. Time's up.

710
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:36,154
Jesus Christ.

711
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:41,285
You could really use a shower.

712
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:46,039
You smell awful, Mr Carter.
Why don't you take a shower?

713
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:49,626
Get you a decent cell
with a bed and some food.

714
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:53,380
- You'll feel a lot better.
- At what price do I, uh...

715
00:59:53,547 --> 00:59:55,465
take this shower?

716
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:59,386
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what do I put on...

717
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:02,723
after I take this shower
that's gonna make me feel so good?

718
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:08,187
What everyone else puts on.
That's the rules.

719
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:13,901
Yeah, well, you can just take me
on back down to the hole.

720
01:00:22,242 --> 01:00:24,912
You could die down there.

721
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:28,415
I could die up here too.

722
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:34,296
Look, what if I got you a pair
of pyjamas from the prison hospital?

723
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:39,968
As far as I'm concerned,
you'd be wearing prison-issued clothing.

724
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:49,686
They got stripes?

725
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:52,814
- No stripes.
- What 'bout numbers?

726
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:56,485
- No numbers.
- What colour are they?

727
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:59,488
They're white.

728
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:08,580
Okay, I can live with those.

729
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:16,046
- Thank you, Mr Carter.
- You're welcome, Mr Williams.

730
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:18,549
Shower's all yours.

731
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,560
Thank you.

732
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:33,272
It came to me as kind of a revelation
that my own freedom...

733
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:38,360
lay in not wanting or needing anything
of which they could deprive me.

734
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:42,239
If punishment consisted
of being locked in your cell...

735
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:45,826
then by simply choosing
to never leave my cell...

736
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,911
I deprived them of that weapon.

737
01:01:48,078 --> 01:01:51,415
I would not work in their shops.
I would not eat their food.

738
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:56,420
I began to study. I dissected
my entire case piece by piece...

739
01:01:56,587 --> 01:02:00,340
beginning with my initial arrest
through the trial itself...

740
01:02:00,507 --> 01:02:03,760
and finally to the awful verdict.

741
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:07,389
I didn't get a trial free from
constitutional error and racial prejudice.

742
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:09,892
He knows that. You know it.

743
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:12,352
That's not helpin' me
in here, Myron.

744
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:17,441
Look. Look, I'm innocent,
that's why.

745
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,902
Seven years! You're goddam right
it's seven years!

746
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:23,614
Just get me outta here.
I want a new trial. Okay?

747
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,952
The people united
will never be defeated.

748
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,081
The people united
will never be defeated.

749
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:36,376
The people united
will never be defeated.

750
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,462
The people united...

751
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:42,508
It shows that there's still hope.

752
01:02:42,674 --> 01:02:46,053
There is hope for change
in America.

753
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,639
I believe in law and order,
and I believe that everybody...

754
01:02:48,805 --> 01:02:51,475
has a right to,
uh, get another trial.

755
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:55,187
<i>Here comes the story</i>
<i>of The Hurricane</i>

756
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:59,107
<i>The man the authorities</i>
<i>came to blame</i>

757
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:02,986
<i>- For something that he never done</i>
- Give a hand for Miss Ellen Burstyn.

758
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:05,656
<i>Put in a prison cell</i>
<i>but one time</i>

759
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:11,245
<i>He could have been</i>
<i>the champion of the world</i>

760
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:18,669
They ain't givin' up. They said
they're gonna demonstrate again.

761
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:22,047
Muhammad Ali and... and Ellen Burstyn.
Bob Dylan.

762
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:24,550
- Everybody.
- That's good, Mae.

763
01:03:24,716 --> 01:03:27,052
Everybody.

764
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:33,433
Look, Mae, uh...

765
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,689
we've already lost two trials, and now they've
turned down my request for an appeal.

766
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:47,406
I'm sorry. It, uh... It's over.

767
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,908
It's finished.

768
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:54,079
I'm gonna die in here,
Mae, so...

769
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,707
- Baby, listen, there is still a chance.
- Listen to me now.

770
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:01,420
- Now, all we have to do is hang on.
- There's nothin' to hang on to.

771
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:06,550
I want you to divorce me,
understand?

772
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:10,095
And I don't want you
to come back down here.

773
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,850
- No. No, now you listen to me.
- Mae, don't make... don't make this...

774
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,311
There... There are still things
that we can do.

775
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:21,064
- We just gotta get you out of here.
- I am not gonna be a weight hanging around your neck.

776
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:26,236
- You are no weight around my neck!
- Well, then you're a weight around mine.

777
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:30,199
Now, I can't do all the years
I gotta do in here...

778
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:34,828
knowin' that they can take your beautiful
face away from me anytime they want to.

779
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:38,582
- You understand?
- Rubin.

780
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,752
I ain't walkin' away from you.

781
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:51,678
I'm dead.

782
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,352
- Rubin.
- Just bury me, please.

783
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,399
Rubin?

784
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,570
Rubin.

785
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:12,407
Rubin, we're... we're in this together
now. We just gotta hang on.

786
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:15,160
Guard.

787
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:18,038
Rubin.

788
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,874
Rubin?

789
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:24,628
We just gotta hang on.

790
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:27,130
We just gotta hang on.

791
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:38,392
I will bend time to my own clock.

792
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,686
When the prisoners awake,
I will sleep.

793
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,814
When they sleep, I will wake.

794
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,526
I will live neither in their cell...

795
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:51,029
nor in my own heart...

796
01:05:51,196 --> 01:05:54,241
only in my mind...

797
01:05:54,503 --> 01:05:57,089
and my spirit.

798
01:05:57,256 --> 01:05:59,967
"Once I reached my hand out for help."

799
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:02,678
It came down and then withered...

800
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:07,183
as dry grass blown away into dust
leaving nothin'.

801
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:10,895
Now I wait for nothin'.
I need nothin'.

802
01:06:11,062 --> 01:06:15,733
Not tomorrow, not freedom,
not justice.

803
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,987
In the end,
the prison will vanish...

804
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:23,658
and there'll be no more Rubin...

805
01:06:23,825 --> 01:06:26,078
no more Carter...

806
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:29,122
only The Hurricane.

807
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:32,000
And after him...

808
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:34,503
"there is no more."

809
01:06:39,758 --> 01:06:42,344
Man, what are we gonna do?

810
01:06:42,511 --> 01:06:46,390
- About what?
- About The Hurricane, that's what.

811
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:49,351
Well, there's not much
we can do, Lesra.

812
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:54,481
B-But the man's innocent, yet he's been
in jail 15, 16 years. That's not right.

813
01:06:56,066 --> 01:07:00,278
- I know that's what his book says.
- Uh, two juries found him guilty, Les.

814
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:03,949
- Yeah, two white juries.
- Hey, hey, not all white people are racists.

815
01:07:04,116 --> 01:07:06,827
Not all black people are murderers.

816
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:19,214
Look, I just... I just want
to write him a letter...

817
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:22,843
and tell him how much his book
meant to me, that's all.

818
01:07:28,306 --> 01:07:32,978
<i>I know you told me</i>

819
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:35,940
<i>- Such a long time ago</i>
- Dear...

820
01:07:38,443 --> 01:07:41,779
- Mr Hurricane.
<i>- That you want me</i>

821
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:47,285
<i>- You don't love me no more</i>
- No, that's really stupid.

822
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:53,708
<i>- I wanna know</i>
- What's that?

823
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:58,337
- It's ten dollars, U.S.
<i>- Oh, what you mean to me</i>

824
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:01,257
- I thought he might need some money for stamps...
<i>- Believe me, darlin'</i>

825
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:03,384
if you want him
to write you back.

826
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:06,346
<i>Oh-oh, no</i>

827
01:08:06,512 --> 01:08:09,390
Yeah. Yeah, write me back.

828
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:13,811
- That's cool. Thanks, Lisa.
<i>- I know you told me</i>

829
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:16,314
No problem.

830
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:26,949
- Dear Mr Rubin Carter.
<i>- And I know</i>

831
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,663
I read your book...

832
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:37,126
and I really felt sad
about what happened to you.

833
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:43,383
I want you to know
how much your book meant to me.

834
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:47,470
<i>Little baby, child</i>
<i>move you</i>

835
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:50,557
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa</i>

836
01:08:50,724 --> 01:08:53,060
<i>Please</i>

837
01:09:49,116 --> 01:09:51,994
It's here! Hey, he wrote us back!
It's here!

838
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:54,913
It's here! He wrote us back!
Home of the brave!

839
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,583
Land of the free!
He wrote us back!

840
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,504
- Can you stand it?
- Well, open it already.

841
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:05,133
I don't know.
You think I should?

842
01:10:14,267 --> 01:10:16,394
"Dear Lesra..."

843
01:10:16,561 --> 01:10:20,148
please forgive
the seemingly tardy reply...

844
01:10:20,315 --> 01:10:23,693
but he who bemoans
the lack of opportunity...

845
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:28,907
forgets that small doors
many times open up into large rooms.

846
01:10:31,785 --> 01:10:36,289
It was not only thoughtful,
but insightful on your part.

847
01:10:36,456 --> 01:10:40,585
Stamps, paper and envelopes...

848
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:44,214
were exactly what was needed
to complete this transmission.

849
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:52,222
Your letter, feelings,
concerns, desires and warmth...

850
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:54,766
literally
jumped off the page at me...

851
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:57,602
when reading
your heartfelt message.

852
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:00,230
It is as if you heard
my thoughts...

853
01:11:00,397 --> 01:11:02,774
and reached out
to share yours with me...

854
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:06,903
at a moment when I can hear you.

855
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:08,988
So thank you once again.

856
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:11,950
Forever...

857
01:11:12,117 --> 01:11:14,578
your friend and brother...

858
01:11:16,747 --> 01:11:19,083
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

859
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,797
Wow.

860
01:11:24,964 --> 01:11:26,632
You got your answer.

861
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,303
Yeah.

862
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:34,849
Dear Rubin...

863
01:11:35,016 --> 01:11:39,270
I've been thinking about my life
compared to yours.

864
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:42,398
I come from Bushwick in Brooklyn.

865
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:47,403
My parents are alcoholics
and my brother's in prison.

866
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:51,032
I was third in my class,
and I couldn't even read.

867
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:54,994
I couldn't write you this letter
just a year ago...

868
01:11:55,161 --> 01:12:00,541
but then I met these friends from Canada
when I had a summer job at the EPA.

869
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:04,086
They offered to educate me
and they got me out.

870
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:10,968
Sometimes I feel guilty about my family
'cause I left 'em behind.

871
01:12:11,135 --> 01:12:15,765
Now that I know you,
I know it isn't right.

872
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:19,101
I shouldn't cry
about my own feelings...

873
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:22,229
not if you can do what you've done.

874
01:12:22,396 --> 01:12:24,398
I've been thinkin' though.

875
01:12:24,566 --> 01:12:28,487
I would like to come and visit you,
if that will be all right.

876
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:14,032
Palm down, right hand.
Keep the line moving.

877
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:16,451
- Put your right hand out, please. Palm down.
- Keep the line moving.

878
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:19,579
- Keep the line moving, please.
- Come on. Come on.

879
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:24,167
Okay, now.

880
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:33,885
Y'all listen up now. Visits for Jones,
Taylor, Harris, Ramos...

881
01:13:34,052 --> 01:13:37,765
Sykes, Carter, Tucei,
line up right here.

882
01:13:37,932 --> 01:13:40,143
Uh, you didn't call my boy's name.

883
01:13:40,309 --> 01:13:43,021
Hemmings. Eric Hemmings, 65660.

884
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:45,356
- Hemmings?
- Yeah.

885
01:13:45,523 --> 01:13:49,652
Uh-uh, no visit for Hemmings today.
He's in lockup.

886
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:53,990
- Okay, Mac, open it up.
- Keep out of the way.

887
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:10,798
Extend your arms. Palms.
Turn around.

888
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:14,010
Show me your feet.
Okay, spread 'em.

889
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:16,512
Next.

890
01:14:20,641 --> 01:14:24,604
Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue.

891
01:14:24,771 --> 01:14:27,648
Extend your arms.

892
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:30,318
Show me your palms.
Turn around.

893
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:34,989
Show me your feet.

894
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:37,450
Spread 'em.

895
01:14:37,617 --> 01:14:39,952
Ready on the outside!

896
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:44,332
Okay, come on.
Single file, y'all.

897
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:47,919
Let's go. Single file.

898
01:14:48,086 --> 01:14:50,631
Hey, sweetheart!

899
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:53,008
Single file.

900
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:55,511
Let's go. Single file.

901
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:01,183
You look nice.

902
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,759
Mr Carter?

903
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:40,472
- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

904
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:45,060
- I'm sorry, you don't look like your pictures. I thought you'd be bigger.
- Hey, I'm bigger than you.

905
01:15:46,645 --> 01:15:50,941
- But don't tell anybody, okay?
- All... All right.

906
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:54,445
Okay. Sit down.

907
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,209
- Hey, this is some place, man.
- No.

908
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:13,006
No, it's not. This is no place,
not for a human being.

909
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:16,968
Don't ever get used to
a place like this, Lesra.

910
01:16:17,135 --> 01:16:19,429
You got a lot of guts, kid.

911
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:24,476
Takes a lot of courage to come
all the way down here by yourself.

912
01:16:24,642 --> 01:16:27,187
I'm impressed.

913
01:16:27,312 --> 01:16:32,067
- I was scared you weren't gonna let me come.
- Me too.

914
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:34,444
But you're Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
What would you be scared of?

915
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:38,239
Well, doors opening,
of the light outside...

916
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:41,659
of you.

917
01:16:41,826 --> 01:16:44,037
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

918
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:46,623
- Mr Carter, I don't understand.
- Oh, no, no, no, don't call me Mr Carter.

919
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,209
- Call me Rube.
- Rube?

920
01:16:49,334 --> 01:16:52,629
Yeah. Rube.

921
01:16:54,422 --> 01:16:56,674
All right. Rube.

922
01:16:58,593 --> 01:17:01,971
So, tell me about these folks
you're livin' with.

923
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,683
- Oh, the Canadians. - Yes.
- Yeah, I got pictures of'em.

924
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:07,936
Here.

925
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:11,690
This is Sam, this is Terry,
and this is Lisa.

926
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:14,193
- They're the greatest, man.
- Huh.

927
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,030
Yeah, I met 'em at an EPA in Brooklyn,
and, you know, they was doin' business.

928
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:21,826
They brought me home and stuff,
and the rest is what happened, man.

929
01:17:21,992 --> 01:17:24,954
Yeah, that's when
my life changed, Rube.

930
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:28,290
Just yanked a brother up and took him
up to Canada, just like that?

931
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:31,001
No, no, they asked my folks.

932
01:17:31,168 --> 01:17:33,879
I see. So what do they do?
Are they a religious group...

933
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:36,632
or, uh, hippies or a commune or...

934
01:17:36,799 --> 01:17:39,385
No, they fix up houses and sell 'em.
You know?

935
01:17:39,552 --> 01:17:41,846
- They're just people.
- Just people.

936
01:17:42,012 --> 01:17:45,349
Just workin', eatin',
livin' together?

937
01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:48,519
I don't know. This is what they do, man.
That's their thing.

938
01:17:48,686 --> 01:17:51,939
- What'd your folks say?
- Oh, well, my dad, you know, he's happy.

939
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:54,150
- He's glad for me.
- Oh, good.

940
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:56,235
You see 'em much,
your people, your folks?

941
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:58,404
Yeah, but sometimes
it's hard though.

942
01:17:58,571 --> 01:18:01,157
Yeah, well...

943
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:03,659
Yeah, it's hard.

944
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:08,456
You give them hope.

945
01:18:08,622 --> 01:18:12,752
- Yeah, I guess.
- You do. You give 'em hope.

946
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:15,713
Because you have transcended, Lesra.

947
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,968
It is very important to transcend
the places that hold us.

948
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:24,889
You know that? You've learned to read.
You've learned to write.

949
01:18:25,056 --> 01:18:27,934
Writing is... it's magic.

950
01:18:29,478 --> 01:18:33,440
You feel that sometimes?

951
01:18:33,607 --> 01:18:36,109
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Mm-hmm.

952
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:38,612
When I started writing...

953
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,618
I discovered that I was doing more
than just telling a story.

954
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:46,953
See, writing is a weapon...

955
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,332
and it's more powerful
than a fist can ever be.

956
01:18:50,499 --> 01:18:54,836
Every time I sat down to write, I could
rise above the walls of this prison.

957
01:18:55,003 --> 01:19:00,801
I could look out over the walls
all across the state of New Jersey.

958
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:03,970
And I could see Nelson Mandela
in his cell writing his book.

959
01:19:04,137 --> 01:19:07,641
I could see Huey.
I could see Dostoyevsky.

960
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:11,603
I could see Victor Hugo, Emile Zola,
and... and they would say to me...

961
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,897
"Rubin, what you doin' in there?"

962
01:19:14,064 --> 01:19:17,025
And I say,
"Hey, I know all you guys."

963
01:19:19,361 --> 01:19:22,322
It's magic, Lesra.

964
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:25,575
Mmm, they sure don't teach it
that way up in Canada.

965
01:19:25,742 --> 01:19:29,037
- Maybe you could tell me some books to read.
- I can do that.

966
01:19:29,204 --> 01:19:32,165
But these people in Canada or anywhere
else, they can only teach you so much.

967
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:35,502
It's up to you. It's your search. You
gotta find out what's true for you...

968
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:40,508
what is true for Lesra Martin.

969
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:44,262
I never met nobody like you before.

970
01:19:48,057 --> 01:19:50,435
You think I killed
those people, son?

971
01:19:52,812 --> 01:19:55,606
- No, I know you didn't.
- How you know?

972
01:19:55,773 --> 01:19:58,067
I just know.

973
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:07,160
I'm so glad I met you, Lesra.

974
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:11,456
Me too.

975
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:16,044
Visit's up.

976
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,171
Everybody out.

977
01:20:19,589 --> 01:20:22,175
Come on, folks. Let's go.

978
01:20:22,341 --> 01:20:24,802
You like a quick picture
of you and your son, Mr Carter?

979
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:27,722
- Come on, folks. Let's go.
- It's up to my son.

980
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:30,224
Yeah, all right. All right.

981
01:20:32,977 --> 01:20:36,189
That's enough pictures.
Come on. Let's go.

982
01:21:18,982 --> 01:21:20,984
Dear Lesra...

983
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:26,490
whoever is responsible for your present
condition obviously cares a great deal.

984
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:31,453
For me, it was a miracle to see
such light in a human being again.

985
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,375
When you came, it was like the day
had started off without the sun.

986
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:38,919
It's dim and it's cool.

987
01:21:39,086 --> 01:21:41,588
Then suddenly,
and without any warning...

988
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:45,843
the sunshine breaks through the dimness
and lights up everything.

989
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:00,315
<i>What ya gonna do</i>
<i>Do you wanna get down</i>

990
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,278
<i>What ya gonna do</i>
<i>Do you wanna get down</i>

991
01:22:03,445 --> 01:22:05,655
You been all around the world,
huh, Mobutu?

992
01:22:05,822 --> 01:22:09,701
- Been everywhere.
- Shut your motherfuckin' mouth up!

993
01:22:09,868 --> 01:22:13,163
<i>Get down on it</i>
<i>Get down on it</i>

994
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:16,666
<i>- Come on and get down on it</i>
- Where your people from, Africa?

995
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:19,753
Born in the Congo. Mm-hmm.

996
01:22:19,919 --> 01:22:22,255
In the blackness of black.

997
01:22:24,049 --> 01:22:27,302
My mother was a Pygmy.
She stood four foot, one inch.

998
01:22:27,469 --> 01:22:31,222
- Hmm.
- My father was a big Watusi.

999
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:33,516
He was seven foot, ten.

1000
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:38,521
He'd have to pick her up
like a little child to kiss her.

1001
01:22:38,688 --> 01:22:41,649
- Hmm, cute.
<i>- Get down on it</i>

1002
01:22:41,816 --> 01:22:43,777
<i>Come on now</i>
<i>Get down on it</i>

1003
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:46,321
<i>If you really want it</i>
<i>get down on it</i>

1004
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:48,907
What do you think of white folks?

1005
01:22:51,368 --> 01:22:56,289
They're just a little bit too much
of this stuff, you know?

1006
01:22:56,456 --> 01:22:59,334
But, uh, then again...

1007
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:04,339
I once rode the rails
with a hobo by the name of, um...

1008
01:23:04,506 --> 01:23:06,758
Alabama.

1009
01:23:06,925 --> 01:23:09,886
Now, he was white folks...

1010
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:13,223
and he was a good man.

1011
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:17,895
Mm-hmm. He saved my life
three times.

1012
01:23:18,062 --> 01:23:21,899
- Three times?
- Mm-hmm. Three times.

1013
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:27,655
Three times life, huh?

1014
01:23:27,822 --> 01:23:30,324
Everything I lost...

1015
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:34,870
that really matters
I lost at the hand of white folks.

1016
01:23:35,037 --> 01:23:37,915
I know what you mean...

1017
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:40,751
but they ain't all bad.

1018
01:23:43,462 --> 01:23:46,298
<i>What ya wanna do</i>
<i>Do you wanna get down</i>

1019
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,262
<i>- What ya gonna do</i>
- But they sure can't dance.

1020
01:23:54,682 --> 01:23:57,643
Oh, shit.

1021
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:59,395
Mm-hmm.

1022
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:05,067
Hey, y'all,
th-this is where we go in.

1023
01:24:05,234 --> 01:24:07,987
Come on.

1024
01:24:08,154 --> 01:24:10,489
Come on!

1025
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:14,118
- Don't look now, but we're being watched.
- Stop it.

1026
01:24:16,162 --> 01:24:19,123
Somehow I don't think
you can smoke in there.

1027
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,419
Right over there.

1028
01:24:25,004 --> 01:24:28,008
Hey, Rube, man, we made it.
How you doin', man?

1029
01:24:28,175 --> 01:24:30,343
All right.

1030
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:33,722
- Sam.
- Hey, Rubin. Good to meet you.

1031
01:24:33,889 --> 01:24:36,099
Yeah. Good, good, good.

1032
01:24:36,266 --> 01:24:38,935
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1033
01:24:39,102 --> 01:24:41,271
- This is Terry.
- Terry.

1034
01:24:41,438 --> 01:24:44,524
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure, Terry. Heard a lot about you.

1035
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:47,277
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

1036
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:51,823
So, you don't look like
I thought you would look.

1037
01:24:53,325 --> 01:24:56,411
Lesra said you were so tough.

1038
01:24:56,578 --> 01:25:01,958
- Is that good?
- Don't know. Don't know.

1039
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:04,628
Don't know. Come on.

1040
01:25:06,129 --> 01:25:08,465
Sit down.

1041
01:25:17,974 --> 01:25:21,687
Everybody together!
I can't stand it.

1042
01:25:21,853 --> 01:25:24,314
So, uh, Rubin,
how's the appeal goin'?

1043
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:28,777
Uh, we hear it's with the New Jersey
Supreme Court. Have they set a date?

1044
01:25:31,154 --> 01:25:33,323
Why don't we talk about Lesra?

1045
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:37,035
I'm sure that Lesra wants to know
what's happening with your case too.

1046
01:25:37,202 --> 01:25:40,623
My case is doing what it's doing.

1047
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:44,210
I have to focus on the fact
that I have to do the time.

1048
01:25:45,628 --> 01:25:48,464
Well, how do you do that?

1049
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:55,221
How do I do that? I do that by not
allowing myself to want or to need...

1050
01:25:56,597 --> 01:25:58,182
anything.

1051
01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:03,146
I'm free in here because
there's nothing I want out here.

1052
01:26:03,312 --> 01:26:07,525
Not free to want?
Not free to risk human contact?

1053
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:10,028
This place doesn't allow you
to be human.

1054
01:26:10,194 --> 01:26:14,782
The only contact you get in here is gettin'
stabbed in the back or gang-raped in the shower.

1055
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:20,163
That's what they've reduced you to. I mean, you've
obviously elevated it to something else with Lesra.

1056
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:23,166
Yeah, because of you, Rube,
I wanna be a lawyer when I grow up...

1057
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,251
and prove you innocent.

1058
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:28,588
Except we don't have to wait till I'm a lawyer,
Rube, because these guys want to help, man.

1059
01:26:28,755 --> 01:26:33,217
- We all believe in your innocence.
- I've been innocent for 16 years.

1060
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:38,639
That's how long I've been in here.
Innocence is a highly overrated commodity.

1061
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:41,350
None of us can judge what you've been
through, but you might wanna consider...

1062
01:26:41,517 --> 01:26:43,811
You're damn right none of you can judge
what I've been through...

1063
01:26:43,978 --> 01:26:46,064
because none of you
have been through it.

1064
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:49,275
What do you know about doing time?
Tell me about it.

1065
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:52,988
What do you know about what it is to be me? What do you...
What do you know about being in this place?

1066
01:26:53,155 --> 01:26:56,784
- Hey, this is too much, you guys.
- Yeah, you're right. This is too much.

1067
01:26:56,909 --> 01:27:00,120
Um, y'all, look,
let's just go, all right?

1068
01:27:06,794 --> 01:27:09,088
- Rubin. Rubin. Rubin.
- Right there.

1069
01:27:09,254 --> 01:27:12,424
Hey, listen, we left a package
for you in the mail room.

1070
01:27:37,908 --> 01:27:40,244
Yes.

1071
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:58,178
Visitors left this for you
in the mail room.

1072
01:27:58,345 --> 01:28:02,099
We had to open it
'cause of security.

1073
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:04,602
Nice to have friends.

1074
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:24,414
"Special gift for The Hurricane."

1075
01:28:31,546 --> 01:28:34,674
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.

1076
01:28:34,841 --> 01:28:37,010
Don't trust 'em.

1077
01:28:44,642 --> 01:28:49,064
You trust a bunch of little white-ass
do-gooders more than you trust me...

1078
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:51,900
more than you trust us.

1079
01:28:53,318 --> 01:28:55,653
Yeah. No more hate.

1080
01:28:57,697 --> 01:28:59,616
Try that on, huh?

1081
01:28:59,783 --> 01:29:02,744
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.
They'll turn on ya. Don't trust 'em, no.

1082
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:06,289
- Think me and you. Me and you.
- See how that fits.

1083
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:12,128
- It's time.
- For what?

1084
01:29:14,381 --> 01:29:16,384
It's time for you to go.

1085
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:20,763
Don't you turn your back on me,
nigger.

1086
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:23,265
Rubin!

1087
01:29:23,432 --> 01:29:25,226
Rubin!

1088
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,145
Ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:29:28,312 --> 01:29:30,648
in this corner...

1090
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:35,903
<i>In this corner,</i>
<i>from Paterson, New Jersey...</i>

1091
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,823
<i>wearing the white trunks</i>
<i>with black stripes...</i>

1092
01:29:38,989 --> 01:29:41,158
<i>Rubin "Hurricane" Carter!</i>

1093
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:57,133
- Okay, Sam. Are you joining us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
01:29:57,299 --> 01:29:59,218
- Lesra, get up back.
- Dear Rubin...

1095
01:29:59,385 --> 01:30:02,263
- I can't believe the warmth and beauty of your letter.
- Ready?

1096
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,474
We get a rich, deep feeling
of experiencing your presence.

1097
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:09,478
You've... You've made what we've
been saying the truth...

1098
01:30:09,645 --> 01:30:12,106
that you can't keep people back
who refuse to be kept back.

1099
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,899
Here we go. Here we go.

1100
01:30:14,066 --> 01:30:17,987
We work out of our home, so we're
always here if you'd like to call.

1101
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:20,698
We'd really like
to hear your voice.

1102
01:30:20,865 --> 01:30:23,826
You are very persuasive...

1103
01:30:23,993 --> 01:30:27,496
and I thank you
for all the things you send me...

1104
01:30:27,663 --> 01:30:30,917
but you people
are a bad influence on me.

1105
01:30:31,084 --> 01:30:34,796
I'm startin' to like all this stuff
a little too much.

1106
01:30:34,963 --> 01:30:37,424
You're lettin' me get loose.

1107
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:49,936
Hello?

1108
01:30:50,103 --> 01:30:54,399
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Hey, Rube, what's happening, man?

1109
01:30:54,566 --> 01:30:59,738
Lesra, boy, you, uh... Well,
you sound more like a man every day.

1110
01:30:59,905 --> 01:31:03,200
Get outta here.

1111
01:31:03,367 --> 01:31:06,620
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, you know Canadians, man.

1112
01:31:06,787 --> 01:31:10,624
They're not happy unless they're outside, you know,
rakin' leaves or tappin' a tree for maple syrup.

1113
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,751
I don't know how they do it, man.
It's cold out there too.

1114
01:31:12,918 --> 01:31:15,587
Hey, what's up, Rube?
Something happen?

1115
01:31:15,712 --> 01:31:18,590
Yeah, I, um...

1116
01:31:18,757 --> 01:31:21,343
heard from the courts, Lesra.

1117
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:24,429
Been denied. I lost the appeal.

1118
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,309
Oh, no, man. Well-Well,
look, look, look, hold on, Rube.

1119
01:31:29,434 --> 01:31:31,937
- Let me tell everyone, okay?
- I gotta go, little brother.

1120
01:31:32,104 --> 01:31:34,856
No, well, wait, Rube!
W-Wait! Wait. Wait. But, Rube!

1121
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:37,484
Rubin!

1122
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:40,570
What's going on?

1123
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,288
Lost the appeal.

1124
01:31:51,582 --> 01:31:54,711
Oh, no.

1125
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:12,311
Dear Lesra, Terry, Sam...

1126
01:32:13,855 --> 01:32:16,441
Lisa...

1127
01:32:16,607 --> 01:32:20,445
this is, in many ways, the saddest
letter I've ever had to write.

1128
01:32:21,946 --> 01:32:25,825
I appreciate your many efforts
and kindnesses...

1129
01:32:25,992 --> 01:32:28,244
but I am a prisoner.

1130
01:32:28,411 --> 01:32:32,582
My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival...

1131
01:32:32,749 --> 01:32:37,837
"My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival..."

1132
01:32:38,004 --> 01:32:41,549
lies in my ability to do the time.

1133
01:32:41,716 --> 01:32:46,095
This place is not one in which humanity
can survive. Only steel can.

1134
01:32:48,848 --> 01:32:51,809
This will be my last letter to you.

1135
01:32:51,976 --> 01:32:55,439
Please do not write.
Please do not visit.

1136
01:32:56,857 --> 01:33:02,196
Please find it in your hearts
to not weaken me with your love.

1137
01:33:02,363 --> 01:33:04,323
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

1138
01:33:09,787 --> 01:33:11,914
Open up, Ken.

1139
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:14,208
Okay.

1140
01:33:16,085 --> 01:33:18,212
Thanks.

1141
01:33:29,098 --> 01:33:31,350
Rubin.

1142
01:33:33,268 --> 01:33:36,438
I got a letter here
for you from Canada.

1143
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:41,485
I'm just gonna slide it
in here for you.

1144
01:33:45,614 --> 01:33:48,158
You do what you want with it.

1145
01:33:59,878 --> 01:34:02,089
"Dear Rube..."

1146
01:34:02,256 --> 01:34:04,675
I know you asked us not to write...

1147
01:34:04,842 --> 01:34:06,970
so I'm not writing...

1148
01:34:07,137 --> 01:34:09,806
just sending you two things.

1149
01:34:09,973 --> 01:34:14,185
One's a picture of me
and my new girlfriend, Pauline.

1150
01:34:15,687 --> 01:34:17,731
The other...

1151
01:34:17,897 --> 01:34:21,317
is something that
rightfully belongs to you...

1152
01:34:21,484 --> 01:34:24,320
my high school diploma.

1153
01:34:24,487 --> 01:34:28,992
"Your friend and brother forever,
Lesra Martin."

1154
01:34:52,348 --> 01:34:55,018
<i>Don't count the stars</i>

1155
01:34:55,143 --> 01:34:59,355
<i>Or you might stumble</i>

1156
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:07,781
Hello.

1157
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:13,536
Yes, I accept...
I... I accept the charges.

1158
01:35:18,584 --> 01:35:21,253
Rubin? Hey.

1159
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,385
R-Rubin, I-I-I can't hear you.

1160
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:38,938
Rube...

1161
01:35:39,105 --> 01:35:41,232
Hello?

1162
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:54,412
He said he can't do the time.

1163
01:36:29,155 --> 01:36:31,324
Uh, collect call to anyone...

1164
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:34,745
from Mr Rubin Carter.

1165
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:38,331
- Get it. Get it.
- Take one.

1166
01:36:38,498 --> 01:36:40,542
- Yes.
- <i>Rubin?</i>

1167
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:44,546
- Lesra? - <i>No, it's Terry. I'm here</i>
<i>with Lisa and Sam, and Lesra's here.</i>

1168
01:36:44,713 --> 01:36:46,715
Hey. How y'all doin'?

1169
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:49,968
<i>Look out the window.</i>

1170
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:52,054
What?

1171
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:56,016
<i>You see that light?</i>
<i>The one that's blinking?</i>

1172
01:36:56,183 --> 01:36:58,435
<i>You see it?</i>

1173
01:36:58,602 --> 01:37:00,687
Yeah.

1174
01:37:00,854 --> 01:37:04,232
<i>Can you see Lesra?</i>

1175
01:37:09,446 --> 01:37:13,367
Yeah, I see you.
What are y'all doin' here?

1176
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:18,121
- Can he see us?
- Yeah, he can see you.

1177
01:37:19,373 --> 01:37:22,334
- Rube!
- We're here.

1178
01:37:22,501 --> 01:37:24,628
We've moved down here.

1179
01:37:26,713 --> 01:37:30,342
- For what? - <i>We're in this thing full-time</i>
<i>until you walk out of there.</i>

1180
01:37:30,509 --> 01:37:32,928
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>Lisa wants to say something.</i>

1181
01:37:33,095 --> 01:37:35,347
Hurricane!

1182
01:37:35,514 --> 01:37:37,933
Hey, Rube.

1183
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,186
<i>Looks like you got</i>
<i>some foot soldiers now, huh?</i>

1184
01:37:43,648 --> 01:37:48,361
We're all in this together,
and we're not leaving till we all leave.

1185
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:55,535
You're beautiful.

1186
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:58,746
We're gonna take you home.

1187
01:37:58,913 --> 01:38:01,457
Okay.

1188
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,671
Okay.

1189
01:38:23,187 --> 01:38:26,315
Rubin has, uh, asked us to give you
copies of everything that we have...

1190
01:38:26,482 --> 01:38:28,401
and to answer any questions.

1191
01:38:28,568 --> 01:38:32,155
And since we've represented him
for over ten years...

1192
01:38:32,321 --> 01:38:34,240
there's an awful lot of material.

1193
01:38:34,407 --> 01:38:37,702
I mean, we have rooms
full of files.

1194
01:38:37,869 --> 01:38:39,996
Absolutely.
And, uh, please understand...

1195
01:38:40,163 --> 01:38:43,416
that we are not here
to second-guess you or...

1196
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:47,628
You know, we... we've come down here
to help in any way we can.

1197
01:38:47,795 --> 01:38:50,840
Anything, you know.
Anything at all.

1198
01:38:56,138 --> 01:38:58,057
Well, that's very kind of you.

1199
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:02,227
And I congratulate you
on your dedication to Rubin's case.

1200
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:04,605
Uh, maybe I should add
that in those ten years...

1201
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:07,107
we've been working on this,
we've donated our services.

1202
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,777
We've never asked for a dime.
We never expect one. Do we?

1203
01:39:09,943 --> 01:39:12,780
- No.
- I wanted to be sure.

1204
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:16,450
And also in that time, uh,
there have been a lot of people...

1205
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:18,994
great people...

1206
01:39:19,161 --> 01:39:21,413
all well-intentioned.

1207
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,499
- Famous.
- Infamous.

1208
01:39:23,665 --> 01:39:27,836
Or not. Boxers, singers,
writers, actors...

1209
01:39:28,003 --> 01:39:30,005
journalists, et cetera.

1210
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:33,217
A lot of brave people
who gave their time...

1211
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:37,388
and, to some degree,
risked their reputations.

1212
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:40,682
People like you.

1213
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:43,143
And, uh...

1214
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:48,232
people come and go,
and, frankly, nobody lasts.

1215
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,486
Nobody stays the course.

1216
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:57,574
Nobody goes the distance,
because it's too tough.

1217
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:00,160
It's too slow...

1218
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:03,455
and it's heartbreaking.

1219
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:07,627
- It's too heartbreaking.
- Well, with all due respect, Mr Friedman...

1220
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:11,798
what you have to understand
is that we're here.

1221
01:40:11,965 --> 01:40:16,928
We've moved here, and we have every intention
of staying here until Rubin is free.

1222
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:19,681
Right on.

1223
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:25,228
So we finally got in to see your lawyers,
Beldock and Friedman, the other day.

1224
01:40:25,395 --> 01:40:29,274
- How'd they take it?
- Oh, I'd say we handled ourselves pretty well.

1225
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:33,361
Yeah, well, we hauled about what, ten
tons of documents, into the apartment.

1226
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:36,906
- In broad daylight? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

1227
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:39,909
This is not Canada.

1228
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:43,079
Now, I can protect you in here...

1229
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:46,666
but there's not much
I can do for you on the outside.

1230
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,835
The only way I'm ever leaving
this place is if...

1231
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:51,755
a lot of very important people
are exposed.

1232
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:55,008
They're not gonna
just let that happen.

1233
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:58,595
- You understand?
- We'll be careful.

1234
01:40:58,762 --> 01:41:02,265
Okay. Well, why don't you walk us
through what happened that night?

1235
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:07,312
Now, three cops have testified
the shooting occurred at 2:45.

1236
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:11,566
- So, uh, what time did you leave the Nite Spot?
- 2:30.

1237
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:16,488
<i>Oh, now tell me where can you party</i>
<i>child, all night long</i>

1238
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:20,534
- <i>In the basement</i>
- Anybody call a cab?

1239
01:41:20,701 --> 01:41:23,746
- <i>Oh, where did you go</i>
- Time for me to get outta here.

1240
01:41:23,913 --> 01:41:26,832
- How much do I owe you, Big Ed?
- Your money's no good here, champ.

1241
01:41:26,999 --> 01:41:31,087
- Anybody call a cab?
- I did, unless Rubin's taking me home.

1242
01:41:33,089 --> 01:41:35,841
If I take you,
it's gonna be more than home.

1243
01:41:36,008 --> 01:41:38,302
Get on outta here, girl.

1244
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:40,262
Shit.

1245
01:41:40,429 --> 01:41:43,682
What were you doin' out so late
on a Thursday night?

1246
01:41:43,849 --> 01:41:47,186
- What does it matter what night it was?
- Wasn't Thursday night ladies' night?

1247
01:41:47,353 --> 01:41:50,189
Didn't it matter to your wife?

1248
01:41:51,649 --> 01:41:55,694
I'm in the penitentiary for murder,
not attempted adultery.

1249
01:42:00,783 --> 01:42:05,162
So there was a cab there.
He must have seen you leave, right?

1250
01:42:05,329 --> 01:42:08,791
No. No, he left before I did.

1251
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:11,544
- Hey.
- Poor daddy goin' home.

1252
01:42:14,755 --> 01:42:17,299
- Bye, Rubin.
- Take it easy.

1253
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:20,219
- Hey, champ.
- Huh? Hey!

1254
01:42:22,263 --> 01:42:24,390
Whoa! He's gone!

1255
01:42:28,394 --> 01:42:31,355
I wish to God John Artis
had met a girl that night.

1256
01:42:31,523 --> 01:42:36,153
I wish that, uh,
he hadn't been there at all.

1257
01:42:36,278 --> 01:42:40,365
He didn't deserve this.
He didn't deserve any of it.

1258
01:42:42,868 --> 01:42:45,412
Artis, let's go. You're done.

1259
01:42:45,579 --> 01:42:48,123
He got the same sentence I got,
and all he had to do...

1260
01:42:48,248 --> 01:42:51,835
was lie and say I killed
those people and...

1261
01:42:52,002 --> 01:42:57,049
they would have let him out
and his nightmare would have been over.

1262
01:42:57,215 --> 01:43:00,802
Most men couldn't have stood up
to that kind of torture...

1263
01:43:02,429 --> 01:43:04,431
but John Artis did.

1264
01:43:04,598 --> 01:43:06,933
The man is my hero.

1265
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:16,735
So the police said it was 2:45
or a little after...

1266
01:43:16,902 --> 01:43:18,945
when all hell broke loose
at the Lafayette bar.

1267
01:43:19,112 --> 01:43:21,615
That's what they said.

1268
01:43:21,782 --> 01:43:25,285
Apparently, the two gunmen entered the
bar and immediately started shooting.

1269
01:43:35,462 --> 01:43:40,300
According to William Marins,
two guys barged in and just opened fire.

1270
01:43:40,467 --> 01:43:43,345
Oliver goes down first.

1271
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:45,932
Nauyaks.

1272
01:43:46,099 --> 01:43:49,060
Then Marins was the only one
who got a look at 'em.

1273
01:43:49,227 --> 01:43:51,437
Then they shoot Hazel Tanis
and leave.

1274
01:43:58,569 --> 01:44:03,408
- What's Bello doing?
- Bello was a lookout for a burglary up the street.

1275
01:44:07,995 --> 01:44:10,998
- And who else saw anything?
- Patty Valentine.

1276
01:44:11,124 --> 01:44:14,127
She said she saw the getaway car.

1277
01:44:18,923 --> 01:44:22,510
And there was a man who lived across the
street by the name of Avery Cockersham.

1278
01:44:22,635 --> 01:44:24,804
Cockersham? That name
was in the police report.

1279
01:44:24,971 --> 01:44:27,849
- That's right.
- So how come he didn't testify?

1280
01:44:28,015 --> 01:44:31,352
The judge threw
the police report out.

1281
01:44:31,477 --> 01:44:34,188
Cockersham left town.
Nobody could find him.

1282
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:38,128
It was two coloured guys. They just
walked in, they started shootin'.

1283
01:45:38,295 --> 01:45:40,714
Call the cops.

1284
01:45:54,311 --> 01:45:58,732
Now, according to the police,
the murders were racially motivated.

1285
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:02,277
See, the bar didn't serve blacks, so
naturally this crazy nigger, Rubin Carter...

1286
01:46:02,444 --> 01:46:05,697
had to take out his vengeance
on the entire white race.

1287
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,414
Uh, this is, uh, Exhibit 11 -F.

1288
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:14,624
- This is 1966. - Wait a minute.
What are you talking about? Where are... Where are you?

1289
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:16,751
- Trial transcripts, 1966.
- Oh. Stick to the blue cards.

1290
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:19,337
- Valentine... Valentine first said...
- I know the blue cards.

1291
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:21,673
The car's taillights
were similar to the getaway car.

1292
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,344
- "Similar."
- Right. Then in '76, Exhibit 89-C, she says, quote...

1293
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:29,681
"The Carter car was unquestionably
the same car. There was no doubt."

1294
01:46:29,806 --> 01:46:31,766
- Closed quote.
- Exactly.

1295
01:46:31,891 --> 01:46:33,810
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?

1296
01:46:33,977 --> 01:46:37,939
Second trial, ten years later,
suddenly she changes her story.

1297
01:46:38,106 --> 01:46:41,359
She drew a picture,
like a bow tie.

1298
01:46:41,526 --> 01:46:45,613
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it here.

1299
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:50,160
"Taillights lit up all across the back like a
butterfly, as the killer's car drove away."

1300
01:46:50,326 --> 01:46:52,245
"Like a butterfly."

1301
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:55,206
So the first thing we have to do is find
out exactly what Rubin's car looked like.

1302
01:46:55,331 --> 01:46:58,626
- We need to find a '66 Dodge Polara.
- Mm-hmm.

1303
01:46:58,793 --> 01:47:01,337
There's the bow-tie lights,
like Patty Valentine described.

1304
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:04,174
- I'm not so sure about that.
- You ready? - Yeah!

1305
01:47:04,257 --> 01:47:07,135
Yeah.

1306
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:15,643
See that?
They don't light up all the way.

1307
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:18,646
Oh, no, that's a Dodge Monaco.
You don't want one of those.

1308
01:47:18,813 --> 01:47:22,818
They don't have the power. Look,
I'll make you a good deal on this one.

1309
01:47:22,985 --> 01:47:25,529
- Shit.
- Monaco?

1310
01:48:07,071 --> 01:48:10,950
- Mr Carter?
- Yeah.

1311
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:13,702
I was told to get you.

1312
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:17,123
Get me? By whom?

1313
01:48:17,248 --> 01:48:19,458
The warden wants to see you.

1314
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:26,841
- For what?
- I don't know.

1315
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:43,316
Open up, Al.

1316
01:49:03,253 --> 01:49:05,505
Mr Carter.

1317
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:14,765
I have a difficult job
running this place...

1318
01:49:14,931 --> 01:49:16,475
but I do it.

1319
01:49:16,641 --> 01:49:19,895
I do it really well.

1320
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:25,067
You called me down here
at 3:00 in the morning to tell me that?

1321
01:49:25,233 --> 01:49:28,862
I hear things.
I hear everything.

1322
01:49:30,989 --> 01:49:33,366
What have you heard, Warden?

1323
01:49:33,533 --> 01:49:36,828
I hear something's goin' down.

1324
01:49:36,953 --> 01:49:42,084
I don't want a mess,
something that I can't clean up.

1325
01:49:42,209 --> 01:49:45,171
This doesn't have anything
to do with my case, does it?

1326
01:49:45,296 --> 01:49:48,216
Shit happens every day...

1327
01:49:48,383 --> 01:49:52,136
and I wanna warn you, that's all.

1328
01:49:52,303 --> 01:49:57,016
Somebody tries to take you down,
something gets started...

1329
01:49:57,183 --> 01:49:59,185
I can't stop it.

1330
01:49:59,352 --> 01:50:03,815
- You understand me?
- What do you suggest I do?

1331
01:50:03,981 --> 01:50:06,943
Stay alive.

1332
01:50:07,110 --> 01:50:10,947
And that goes for your friends too.

1333
01:50:11,114 --> 01:50:14,033
Guard.

1334
01:50:40,059 --> 01:50:45,189
- Who is it?
- We're looking for an Avery Cockersham.

1335
01:50:49,068 --> 01:50:52,363
Do the Cockershams live here?

1336
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:55,825
I'm Mrs Cockersham.
What do you want?

1337
01:50:55,992 --> 01:50:57,911
You're black.

1338
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:02,207
You're white.

1339
01:51:02,374 --> 01:51:06,378
Baked fresh this morning.
Now, you take the white one.

1340
01:51:08,964 --> 01:51:12,468
Yeah, there were plenty coloured folks
in the neighbourhood...

1341
01:51:12,634 --> 01:51:15,929
and in the bar too.

1342
01:51:16,055 --> 01:51:19,391
- Avery and me were regulars.
- They served blacks in the bar?

1343
01:51:19,558 --> 01:51:21,477
We had a running tab.

1344
01:51:21,643 --> 01:51:25,189
So much for the racial motive, eh?

1345
01:51:25,355 --> 01:51:28,859
My Avery got a good look
at those men...

1346
01:51:29,026 --> 01:51:31,236
and it wasn't Rubin Carter.

1347
01:51:31,403 --> 01:51:34,656
He told the police.
He told 'em and he told 'em.

1348
01:51:34,823 --> 01:51:37,493
He even signed a statement
for that detective.

1349
01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:40,746
You know the one. Heavy set.

1350
01:51:40,913 --> 01:51:43,916
He looked like
a bulldog with glasses.

1351
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:47,127
- Della Pesca.
- That's the one.

1352
01:51:47,294 --> 01:51:51,507
Could we, uh,
talk with your husband?

1353
01:51:53,884 --> 01:51:56,220
Avery's dead.

1354
01:51:57,846 --> 01:52:00,891
He died just before the trial.

1355
01:52:04,812 --> 01:52:07,106
I'm sorry.

1356
01:52:29,963 --> 01:52:33,216
Here's stuff I wanna check out.

1357
01:52:33,383 --> 01:52:35,844
What is this?

1358
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:38,930
Who the fuck you think you are?

1359
01:52:41,099 --> 01:52:45,228
- Does this look like Toronto to you?
- Excuse me?

1360
01:52:45,395 --> 01:52:47,522
You know, you people, you got
some nerve comin' down here...

1361
01:52:47,689 --> 01:52:51,860
pokin' your nose
where it don't belong.

1362
01:52:52,026 --> 01:52:56,531
Let me ask you something,
Mr Canada.

1363
01:52:56,698 --> 01:52:59,451
What the fuck do you know
about this place, huh? Huh?

1364
01:52:59,617 --> 01:53:02,620
You know anything?
You don't know shit.

1365
01:53:02,787 --> 01:53:05,039
Let me enlighten you...

1366
01:53:05,206 --> 01:53:09,627
because you don't know
what you're doin'.

1367
01:53:09,794 --> 01:53:14,924
You are making enemies
that you don't know exist.

1368
01:53:15,091 --> 01:53:19,054
- Huh?
- We know about you.

1369
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:22,349
You don't know shit about me.
You understand?

1370
01:53:22,516 --> 01:53:25,478
You don't know shit about this place,
and let me tell ya something else.

1371
01:53:25,644 --> 01:53:27,688
You're not welcome here, okay?

1372
01:53:27,855 --> 01:53:30,524
You're not fuckin' welcome here.

1373
01:53:30,691 --> 01:53:34,403
You got that?
Go back to where you belong.

1374
01:53:59,136 --> 01:54:01,806
Lesra's gonna have to get on
with school, so...

1375
01:54:01,931 --> 01:54:05,351
we might want to send him back
for a while.

1376
01:54:05,518 --> 01:54:08,354
- I understand. It's probably the best.
- Yeah.

1377
01:54:08,521 --> 01:54:11,774
- Yeah.
- What about you?

1378
01:54:11,941 --> 01:54:16,737
Oh, it's... it's gonna take
a little longer than we thought.

1379
01:54:20,199 --> 01:54:22,410
Y'all all right?

1380
01:54:24,578 --> 01:54:27,665
Yeah.

1381
01:54:37,592 --> 01:54:39,678
I have asked myself, Lisa...

1382
01:54:39,845 --> 01:54:43,890
if I could do for anyone...

1383
01:54:44,057 --> 01:54:48,228
what you and Sam and Terry and Lesra
have done for me, and the answer is no.

1384
01:54:48,395 --> 01:54:50,731
- So if you feel like you need to go home...
- Shh. We're not...

1385
01:54:50,897 --> 01:54:55,068
for any reason,
I'll understand. You...

1386
01:54:55,235 --> 01:54:58,280
No, you gotta understand.
We're not...

1387
01:54:58,447 --> 01:55:01,533
We're not leaving without you.

1388
01:55:03,785 --> 01:55:06,496
All right?

1389
01:55:06,663 --> 01:55:09,416
And we're gonna find something.

1390
01:55:15,547 --> 01:55:17,174
Um, well, I found something...

1391
01:55:18,759 --> 01:55:22,179
a fellow by the name of Barbieri.

1392
01:55:24,014 --> 01:55:28,143
He's a private investigator. Prosecution
hired him in the second trial.

1393
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:30,854
- Didn't he resign from the case or something?
- He quit...

1394
01:55:31,021 --> 01:55:34,316
and he turned in his murder book
and crime-scene photos...

1395
01:55:34,483 --> 01:55:37,736
list of evidence, but no notes.

1396
01:55:37,903 --> 01:55:40,655
- Anyone talk to him?
- Myron tracked him down.

1397
01:55:40,822 --> 01:55:43,200
- What'd he say?
- Nothin'. He was scared.

1398
01:55:43,366 --> 01:55:46,871
- Of whom?
- Of the people he was workin' with.

1399
01:55:57,215 --> 01:55:59,634
- Mrs Barbieri?
- Miss.

1400
01:55:59,801 --> 01:56:04,013
- Hello. Uh, is Mr Barbieri in?
- There isn't any mister.

1401
01:56:05,973 --> 01:56:09,310
Uh, Dominick, Dominick Barbieri?

1402
01:56:09,477 --> 01:56:13,523
That was my father.
He passed away years ago.

1403
01:56:25,576 --> 01:56:28,996
Wow. Maybe you oughta have
a yard sale.

1404
01:56:29,163 --> 01:56:31,624
That case always bothered
my father.

1405
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:36,003
He never talked about it. He said
he had to live in this town, you know?

1406
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:38,715
Yeah. Do you have any idea
where his notes might be?

1407
01:56:38,881 --> 01:56:42,260
Well, if he kept them at all,
they'd be in one of those boxes.

1408
01:56:45,847 --> 01:56:49,851
Guy was a pack rat. He must have saved
every case he ever worked on.

1409
01:56:53,271 --> 01:56:55,606
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1410
01:56:57,608 --> 01:57:00,279
- I found it. Look at this. Look.
- What?

1411
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:03,157
- He kept a damn diary.
- Oh, look.

1412
01:57:03,323 --> 01:57:06,952
Who would have thought he'd put it
in a diary? But he did. Look at this.

1413
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:09,121
There.

1414
01:57:09,288 --> 01:57:12,374
A call was placed to
an emergency operator named Jean Wahl...

1415
01:57:12,541 --> 01:57:15,627
at 2:28 a.m. to report the shooting.

1416
01:57:15,794 --> 01:57:18,338
- At 2:28?
- That's right.

1417
01:57:18,505 --> 01:57:21,425
She then calls the cops
to tell them.

1418
01:57:21,592 --> 01:57:24,011
They say they already know about it.
In fact...

1419
01:57:24,178 --> 01:57:28,390
they've got a cruiser on its way
over to the Lafayette at that moment.

1420
01:57:28,557 --> 01:57:30,684
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

1421
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:35,814
According to Barbieri...

1422
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:39,651
"time on the record
of customer contact was changed...

1423
01:57:39,818 --> 01:57:42,780
from 2:28 to 2:45."

1424
01:57:42,946 --> 01:57:45,949
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch.

1425
01:57:46,116 --> 01:57:48,660
Which, if true,
puts John Artis and myself...

1426
01:57:48,827 --> 01:57:52,498
at the Nite Spot
at the time of the killings.

1427
01:57:52,664 --> 01:57:55,542
Well, if we can prove
she got the call at 2:28.

1428
01:57:55,709 --> 01:57:57,920
We'll prove it.

1429
01:58:00,798 --> 01:58:03,008
We can prove it.

1430
01:58:15,021 --> 01:58:17,232
Mrs Wahl?

1431
01:58:17,399 --> 01:58:22,237
Hi. My name is Sam Chaiton.
We spoke on the phone about the Rubin Carter case.

1432
01:58:22,404 --> 01:58:25,073
- I told you, I don't want to talk to you.
- Mrs Wahl, please.

1433
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:27,409
Um, you told an investigator
named Barbieri...

1434
01:58:27,575 --> 01:58:32,330
that an emergency call you took the night
of the Lafayette bar murders was at 2:28.

1435
01:58:32,497 --> 01:58:35,333
I don't know what I told him.
It was a long time ago.

1436
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:39,462
Uh, but there's a card
that says 2:45 on it...

1437
01:58:39,629 --> 01:58:42,590
and, uh, you didn't sign the card.

1438
01:58:42,757 --> 01:58:46,428
According to Barbieri, it was signed
by a Miss Lenore Harkinson.

1439
01:58:46,594 --> 01:58:50,223
- She was my supervisor.
- Why would your supervisor sign the card?

1440
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:52,600
And wouldn't you normally
do that yourself?

1441
01:58:52,767 --> 01:58:56,730
Look, if there's a card and that's
what it says, then that's what it says.

1442
01:58:56,896 --> 01:59:01,526
I don't remember anything else. And if someone tries
to make me testify, that's just what I'll say.

1443
01:59:01,693 --> 01:59:04,946
Uh, look, Mrs Wahl...

1444
01:59:05,113 --> 01:59:07,240
Thank you.

1445
01:59:09,576 --> 01:59:13,455
So this is a copy of the phone
company's record of customer contact.

1446
01:59:13,621 --> 01:59:17,041
It's all there,
just like Barbieri said.

1447
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:19,461
2:45.

1448
01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:23,507
Look at the signature on the card.

1449
01:59:23,674 --> 01:59:27,762
It's signed by Lenora Harkinson,
Jean Wahl's supervisor.

1450
01:59:27,928 --> 01:59:31,182
Does that mean anything to you?

1451
01:59:32,933 --> 01:59:35,936
It means she didn't have
to write up a phoney ticket.

1452
01:59:36,103 --> 01:59:38,773
What?

1453
01:59:38,898 --> 01:59:41,358
He signed it himself.

1454
01:59:41,525 --> 01:59:44,612
Who?

1455
01:59:44,779 --> 01:59:49,116
His handwriting is
on every report that...

1456
01:59:49,283 --> 01:59:52,953
put me in prison
since I was 11 years old.

1457
01:59:55,706 --> 01:59:57,958
It's Della Pesca.

1458
02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:03,589
It's his handwriting.

1459
02:00:16,644 --> 02:00:19,105
- Oh, shit! What's happening?
- What the hell is that?

1460
02:00:19,271 --> 02:00:22,233
- Don't know.
- What is that?

1461
02:00:27,154 --> 02:00:29,031
- Oh, shit!
- Hold on!

1462
02:00:34,954 --> 02:00:38,333
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1463
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,086
- Les, you okay?
- I'm all right. - Are ya?

1464
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:46,550
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I think so. Damn.

1465
02:00:48,385 --> 02:00:50,679
- Yeah?
- Shit.
- Hey, you okay?

1466
02:00:50,846 --> 02:00:53,432
- What the fuck was that?
- Need help?

1467
02:00:53,598 --> 02:00:55,684
We're okay. Thanks.

1468
02:00:55,851 --> 02:00:57,894
- Are they all right?
- Goddam.

1469
02:00:58,061 --> 02:01:01,022
The car just went right over
the centre divider...

1470
02:01:14,453 --> 02:01:17,956
Rubin, the law states we have to take our new
evidence back to the original trial judge...

1471
02:01:18,123 --> 02:01:22,335
- and then if he turns us down, we go to the state appeals court...
- No. No, no, no, no!

1472
02:01:22,502 --> 02:01:27,340
Listen to me. These people
aren't gonna just let that happen.

1473
02:01:27,507 --> 02:01:29,634
They've made their careers
on my case.

1474
02:01:29,801 --> 02:01:33,013
- What are you talking about, Rubin?
- I'm talking about lawyers, prosecutors, judges...

1475
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:36,725
who have moved up the ladder
on my black back.

1476
02:01:38,727 --> 02:01:41,063
We don't even know what enemies
we have out there in this state.

1477
02:01:41,229 --> 02:01:44,900
We gotta take it out of New Jersey, and
we gotta take it to the federal court.

1478
02:01:45,067 --> 02:01:47,611
Rubin, if you go
into federal court...

1479
02:01:47,778 --> 02:01:50,531
with new evidence that hasn't been
heard in the state court...

1480
02:01:50,698 --> 02:01:53,242
the judge is gonna throw
it out, okay?

1481
02:01:53,409 --> 02:01:55,787
- That is the law.
- Then we transcend the law.

1482
02:01:55,953 --> 02:01:59,040
We, we, we get back to humanity.

1483
02:01:59,207 --> 02:02:01,751
You said it yourself.
You said if we take the new evidence...

1484
02:02:01,918 --> 02:02:05,505
before the federal judge, he's gotta look
at it before he throws it out, right?

1485
02:02:05,671 --> 02:02:09,342
- Right. - I believe that once he looks
at it, he will have seen the truth.

1486
02:02:09,509 --> 02:02:13,721
Having seen the truth,
he can't turn his back on me.

1487
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:17,308
And what if you're wrong
and he does turn away? Then what?

1488
02:02:17,475 --> 02:02:20,770
Then you throw out all this evidence
that everyone's fought so hard to get.

1489
02:02:20,937 --> 02:02:25,191
And you know what, Rubin? You will never be
able to mention it in a court of law again.

1490
02:02:25,358 --> 02:02:29,779
It is finished. It's erased.
It's as if it never happened.

1491
02:02:29,946 --> 02:02:34,200
This evidence is the key to getting you out of
here, and you'll be throwing it away, Rubin...

1492
02:02:34,367 --> 02:02:37,703
- when in a few more years...
- I don't have a few more years, Myron!

1493
02:02:39,414 --> 02:02:41,999
- Leon, help me out.
- I can't.

1494
02:02:42,166 --> 02:02:44,502
I agree with Rubin.
It's time to move on.

1495
02:02:44,669 --> 02:02:47,422
- Move on? What do you mean, move on? Move on where?
- The state's biased, Myron.

1496
02:02:47,588 --> 02:02:49,590
We're never gonna get anything there.
We have to go federal.

1497
02:02:49,757 --> 02:02:54,721
- We can't take the risk of going federal with this.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

1498
02:03:00,185 --> 02:03:02,521
I'm 50 years old.

1499
02:03:06,316 --> 02:03:10,279
I've been locked up
here for 30 years.

1500
02:03:13,699 --> 02:03:18,078
I've put a lot of
good people's lives at risk.

1501
02:03:18,245 --> 02:03:21,206
Now, either I get outta here...

1502
02:03:26,378 --> 02:03:28,964
Get me outta here.

1503
02:03:53,363 --> 02:03:55,491
Ready?

1504
02:03:58,035 --> 02:04:00,287
Good luck, Rubin.

1505
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:11,381
This is for you.
You stay strong.

1506
02:04:18,264 --> 02:04:22,894
- Good luck.
- My man. Peace, baby. Be cool now.

1507
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:25,188
Good luck, Mr Carter.

1508
02:04:48,211 --> 02:04:51,589
- Rubin.
- Rubin Carter, prisoner 45472.

1509
02:04:53,091 --> 02:04:55,760
- See you around.
- Okay, Jimmy.

1510
02:05:04,018 --> 02:05:06,604
Your Honour, we appear before you...

1511
02:05:06,771 --> 02:05:11,401
in our 19th year before the courts.

1512
02:05:11,568 --> 02:05:15,280
Rubin Carter has never enjoyed
a full, fair...

1513
02:05:15,447 --> 02:05:17,949
and unforced disclosure
of the facts...

1514
02:05:18,116 --> 02:05:21,119
to which he is
constitutionally entitled.

1515
02:05:23,413 --> 02:05:27,293
For 19 years,
the truth has been hidden...

1516
02:05:28,878 --> 02:05:31,422
not only from Rubin Carter's eyes...

1517
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:34,967
- but from the eyes of justice itself and...
- Uh, Your Honour.

1518
02:05:35,134 --> 02:05:37,178
The prosecution
objects forcefully here.

1519
02:05:37,344 --> 02:05:39,805
Counsel is attempting
to present new evidence...

1520
02:05:39,972 --> 02:05:42,558
and circumvent
the State Court of New Jersey.

1521
02:05:42,725 --> 02:05:45,144
Your Honour must,
according to the law...

1522
02:05:45,311 --> 02:05:48,522
drop this entire petition
where it belongs... into the garbage.

1523
02:05:48,689 --> 02:05:51,984
Your Honour, we implore you
to at least hear us...

1524
02:05:52,151 --> 02:05:54,236
before making your ruling.

1525
02:05:54,403 --> 02:05:56,530
Mr Beldock, I hope you understand...

1526
02:05:56,697 --> 02:05:59,658
the implications of your action.

1527
02:05:59,825 --> 02:06:04,121
That is a very slippery slope...

1528
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:08,000
you're trying to climb.

1529
02:06:08,167 --> 02:06:11,837
- We do, Your Honour.
- Proceed.

1530
02:06:16,926 --> 02:06:20,012
In 1976, the State of New Jersey's...

1531
02:06:20,179 --> 02:06:23,140
chief investigator of this case,
Dominick Barbieri...

1532
02:06:23,307 --> 02:06:26,727
resigned because he
discovered the truth.

1533
02:06:26,894 --> 02:06:28,938
He discovered
that this case was built...

1534
02:06:29,105 --> 02:06:33,275
on a foundation
of forgeries and lies.

1535
02:06:33,442 --> 02:06:36,487
Those lies show the guilt
not of Rubin Carter...

1536
02:06:36,654 --> 02:06:40,867
but of a corrupt police force
and the prosecutor's office.

1537
02:06:45,372 --> 02:06:49,793
And now this wall of lies
has been destroyed...

1538
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:52,921
so that this court
may finally see the truth...

1539
02:06:53,088 --> 02:06:56,216
and, pray God,
not turn its eyes away.

1540
02:06:56,383 --> 02:07:00,762
This court is
not unmoved by your...

1541
02:07:00,929 --> 02:07:03,598
eloquence and passion...

1542
02:07:03,724 --> 02:07:06,601
but the prosecution is correct.

1543
02:07:06,768 --> 02:07:09,438
This petition
contains new evidence...

1544
02:07:09,563 --> 02:07:14,735
that has not been presented
before the State Court of New Jersey...

1545
02:07:14,901 --> 02:07:18,613
and there is no legal argument
that you could make...

1546
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:21,616
which would allow me to consider it.

1547
02:07:21,783 --> 02:07:25,454
Therefore, you have
two choices before you:

1548
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:28,790
I can send this case
back to the state court...

1549
02:07:28,957 --> 02:07:31,626
and you can present the evidence...

1550
02:07:31,793 --> 02:07:35,046
or, if you insist...

1551
02:07:35,213 --> 02:07:38,800
on, uh, proceeding...

1552
02:07:38,967 --> 02:07:42,679
this evidence will be lost
to you forever.

1553
02:07:47,184 --> 02:07:51,189
You understand the choice
before you, Mr Beldock?

1554
02:07:58,196 --> 02:08:03,034
Your Honour, may I request
a moment to confer with my client?

1555
02:08:03,201 --> 02:08:07,205
That's the smartest thing
you've said all morning, Counsellor.

1556
02:08:14,504 --> 02:08:18,341
Rubin, listen to me. This judge is telling
us as clearly as he possibly can...

1557
02:08:18,508 --> 02:08:21,052
that he's going
to rule against you.

1558
02:08:21,219 --> 02:08:23,971
- This is our last stand, Myron.
- Rubin, I am begging you...

1559
02:08:24,138 --> 02:08:26,349
Let's proceed.

1560
02:08:36,651 --> 02:08:42,907
Your Honour, my client wishes
to continue with this proceeding.

1561
02:08:43,074 --> 02:08:45,159
Uh, do you do so formally...

1562
02:08:45,326 --> 02:08:49,038
and, uh, are you aware of the, uh...

1563
02:08:49,205 --> 02:08:52,583
significance of such an action?

1564
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:56,045
We do so formally.

1565
02:09:01,342 --> 02:09:04,680
- Proceed.
- But, Your Honour...

1566
02:09:04,847 --> 02:09:06,974
- Yes?
- Uh, the state is not prepared...

1567
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:09,476
to proceed to argue
the merits of this case.

1568
02:09:09,643 --> 02:09:11,520
Why not?

1569
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,399
Well, we, we assumed...

1570
02:09:15,566 --> 02:09:19,194
that the court would not hear
this petition based on new evidence.

1571
02:09:21,321 --> 02:09:23,240
You assumed wrong.

1572
02:09:27,161 --> 02:09:29,288
Proceed.

1573
02:09:31,081 --> 02:09:34,585
So, Your Honour, this case
was poisoned from the start.

1574
02:09:34,752 --> 02:09:36,670
No evidence.

1575
02:09:36,837 --> 02:09:40,632
No witnesses,
except admitted liars.

1576
02:09:40,799 --> 02:09:43,677
Only a racially charged atmosphere...

1577
02:09:43,844 --> 02:09:47,389
which was fanned by the police
and the prosecutors...

1578
02:09:47,556 --> 02:09:51,268
who knew the truth
and distorted it...

1579
02:09:51,435 --> 02:09:55,314
and subverted it and destroyed it...

1580
02:09:55,481 --> 02:09:57,733
to convict an innocent man.

1581
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,696
What more can the State
of New Jersey do, Your Honour...

1582
02:10:02,863 --> 02:10:05,365
than give a man not one...

1583
02:10:05,532 --> 02:10:07,910
but two jury trials?

1584
02:10:08,077 --> 02:10:10,788
And nothing has changed since then.

1585
02:10:10,954 --> 02:10:15,376
Mr Carter is, and always has been,
a menace to society.

1586
02:10:15,543 --> 02:10:17,796
He's been in and out of jail
his whole life.

1587
02:10:17,962 --> 02:10:20,632
A criminal.
He's a violent man.

1588
02:10:20,799 --> 02:10:23,176
His whole life has been violence.

1589
02:10:23,343 --> 02:10:26,596
And it is our duty, Your Honour,
to continue to protect...

1590
02:10:26,763 --> 02:10:29,933
the general public
from such a man.

1591
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:32,435
Thank you.

1592
02:10:39,526 --> 02:10:44,989
I've heard your statements.
Uh, I'll take them under consideration.

1593
02:10:45,156 --> 02:10:49,077
Now, is there anything else
that counsel wishes to add...

1594
02:10:49,244 --> 02:10:52,789
before I make my final ruling?

1595
02:10:52,956 --> 02:10:55,083
- What are you doing? - I want to say something.
- What are you gonna say?

1596
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:58,086
I want to...
I need to say something.

1597
02:10:58,253 --> 02:11:01,005
Uh, Your Honour, m-my...
my client, Mr Carter...

1598
02:11:01,172 --> 02:11:03,425
wishes to address the court.

1599
02:11:05,385 --> 02:11:07,804
Request granted.

1600
02:11:07,971 --> 02:11:10,098
Thank you, Your Honour.

1601
02:11:12,642 --> 02:11:15,478
I was a, um...

1602
02:11:15,645 --> 02:11:17,897
prizefighter.

1603
02:11:19,607 --> 02:11:22,193
My job was to...

1604
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,404
take all the hatred...

1605
02:11:24,571 --> 02:11:27,241
and skill that I could muster...

1606
02:11:27,408 --> 02:11:32,121
and send a man to his destruction,
and I did that.

1607
02:11:34,331 --> 02:11:37,626
But Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
is no murderer.

1608
02:11:40,337 --> 02:11:43,591
Twenty years I've spent
locked up in a cage...

1609
02:11:43,758 --> 02:11:45,968
considered a danger to society.

1610
02:11:47,887 --> 02:11:50,222
Not treated like a human being.

1611
02:11:50,389 --> 02:11:53,059
Not treated like a person.

1612
02:11:53,225 --> 02:11:56,103
Counted 15 times a day.

1613
02:11:58,481 --> 02:12:00,900
I serve my time
in a house of justice...

1614
02:12:01,067 --> 02:12:03,444
and yet, there's
no justice for me.

1615
02:12:05,071 --> 02:12:10,743
So, I ask you
to consider the evidence.

1616
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:15,998
Don't turn away from the truth.
Don't turn away from your conscience.

1617
02:12:16,165 --> 02:12:19,835
Please, don't ignore the law.
No, em-embrace that...

1618
02:12:20,002 --> 02:12:24,131
higher principle for which
the law was meant to serve.

1619
02:12:28,469 --> 02:12:31,222
Justice. That's all
I ask for, Your Honour.

1620
02:12:33,557 --> 02:12:36,227
Justice.

1621
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,859
This court is in recess.

1622
02:12:57,332 --> 02:12:59,668
Oh, thank you.

1623
02:13:12,013 --> 02:13:14,141
It's good.

1624
02:13:21,148 --> 02:13:24,568
Come a long way,
huh, little brother?

1625
02:13:26,862 --> 02:13:29,406
Yeah.

1626
02:13:29,573 --> 02:13:31,908
Look, Rubin, I just want you to know
if this doesn't work...

1627
02:13:32,075 --> 02:13:34,953
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1628
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:37,247
- You are?
- Yeah. That's right.

1629
02:13:37,414 --> 02:13:39,541
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1630
02:13:42,419 --> 02:13:45,213
What was the first book
you ever bought?

1631
02:13:46,757 --> 02:13:48,967
Yours.

1632
02:13:50,385 --> 02:13:53,890
You think that was an accident?

1633
02:13:54,056 --> 02:13:57,101
- No.
- No, me neither.

1634
02:13:57,268 --> 02:14:01,064
Lesra, short for Lazarus.

1635
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:04,609
"He who has risen from the dead."

1636
02:14:06,152 --> 02:14:08,571
Rubin.

1637
02:14:08,738 --> 02:14:11,824
Genesis, chapter 29, verse 32.

1638
02:14:11,991 --> 02:14:14,577
"Behold a son."

1639
02:14:17,038 --> 02:14:19,248
You put those two together, Lesra,
and you have...

1640
02:14:19,415 --> 02:14:22,668
"Behold a son who is risen...

1641
02:14:22,835 --> 02:14:25,046
from the dead."

1642
02:14:27,924 --> 02:14:30,134
That's no accident.

1643
02:14:34,305 --> 02:14:37,183
Hate put me in prison.

1644
02:14:39,352 --> 02:14:42,438
Love's gonna bust me out.

1645
02:14:46,526 --> 02:14:51,155
Just in case love doesn't,
I'm gonna bust you outta here.

1646
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:04,378
Yeah.

1647
02:15:04,545 --> 02:15:08,006
You already have, Lesra.

1648
02:15:08,257 --> 02:15:10,300
All rise.

1649
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:16,807
This Federal District Court
of New Jersey is now in session.

1650
02:15:16,974 --> 02:15:19,184
Judge Sarokin presiding.

1651
02:15:23,021 --> 02:15:25,691
Be seated.

1652
02:15:44,001 --> 02:15:48,922
This court does not arrive
at its conclusion lightly.

1653
02:15:49,089 --> 02:15:52,426
On one hand, Rubin Carter
has submitted a document...

1654
02:15:52,593 --> 02:15:55,345
alleging racial prejudice...

1655
02:15:55,512 --> 02:15:58,891
coercion of testimony
and withholding of evidence.

1656
02:15:59,057 --> 02:16:01,143
On the other hand...

1657
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:04,396
Mr Carter was tried twice...

1658
02:16:04,563 --> 02:16:06,774
by two different juries...

1659
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:09,485
and those convictions
were subsequently upheld...

1660
02:16:09,651 --> 02:16:13,447
by the New Jersey
State Supreme Court.

1661
02:16:13,614 --> 02:16:17,786
He's gonna rule against us.
Rubin's gonna lose.

1662
02:16:17,952 --> 02:16:20,246
However, the extensive record...

1663
02:16:20,413 --> 02:16:22,874
clearly demonstrates
to this court...

1664
02:16:23,041 --> 02:16:25,335
that Rubin Carter's conviction...

1665
02:16:25,502 --> 02:16:28,713
was predicated upon an appeal...

1666
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,132
to racism...

1667
02:16:31,299 --> 02:16:33,426
rather than reason...

1668
02:16:33,593 --> 02:16:35,804
and concealment...

1669
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:39,140
rather than disclosure.

1670
02:16:39,307 --> 02:16:41,851
To permit convictions to stand...

1671
02:16:42,018 --> 02:16:44,354
which have
as their sole foundation...

1672
02:16:44,521 --> 02:16:48,274
appeals to racial prejudice...

1673
02:16:48,441 --> 02:16:50,777
is to commit...

1674
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:53,154
a violation...

1675
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:55,323
of the Constitution...

1676
02:16:55,490 --> 02:16:59,494
as heinous as the crimes
for which the defendants...

1677
02:16:59,661 --> 02:17:01,704
were tried...

1678
02:17:01,871 --> 02:17:03,832
and convicted.

1679
02:17:03,998 --> 02:17:06,418
I hereby order Rubin Carter...

1680
02:17:06,584 --> 02:17:09,254
- released from prison...
- Yes!

1681
02:17:09,379 --> 02:17:12,382
Henceforth, from this day forward.

1682
02:17:12,507 --> 02:17:15,385
Yes! Yes.

1683
02:17:17,011 --> 02:17:19,806
This court is adjourned.

1684
02:17:19,973 --> 02:17:24,018
Hey, Rube, you made... you made it, man!
You're free! Can you stand it?

1685
02:17:27,857 --> 02:17:30,359
You did it, Rube.
You did it, man.

1686
02:17:32,236 --> 02:17:35,114
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah!

1687
02:17:54,258 --> 02:17:57,261
<i>Rubin Carter has just been freed.</i>

1688
02:18:10,941 --> 02:18:13,527
All right!
You're free, Rubin!

1689
02:18:40,055 --> 02:18:42,766
Mr Carter.
Hey, Mr Carter.

1690
02:18:42,891 --> 02:18:45,018
Mr Carter.

1691
02:19:00,826 --> 02:19:03,870
Mr Carter? Mr Carter?

1692
02:19:06,873 --> 02:19:11,002
Mr Carter? Now that you're out,
a-are you still gonna be The Hurricane?

1693
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:17,134
Oh, I'll always be The Hurricane.

1694
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:20,887
And The Hurricane is beautiful.

1695
02:19:23,682 --> 02:19:26,518
This is unbelievable!

1696
02:19:26,685 --> 02:19:28,895
The crowd is going wild.

1697
02:19:29,062 --> 02:19:33,442
Everybody wanted this victory,
and Hurricane has delivered.

1698
02:19:37,279 --> 02:19:40,782
<i>Yes, that's the story</i>
<i>of The Hurricane</i>

1699
02:19:40,949 --> 02:19:44,077
<i>But it won't be over</i>
<i>till they clear his name</i>

1700
02:19:44,244 --> 02:19:47,789
<i>And give him back</i>
<i>the time he's done</i>

1701
02:19:47,914 --> 02:19:50,667
<i>Put in a prison cell</i>
<i>but one time</i>

1702
02:19:50,834 --> 02:19:55,465
<i>He could have been</i>
<i>the champion of the world</i>

1703
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:07,704
<i>When your life's a wall</i>

1704
02:21:07,871 --> 02:21:11,542
<i>Can't see the light of day</i>

1705
02:21:11,708 --> 02:21:15,337
<i>When your hope is gone</i>

1706
02:21:15,462 --> 02:21:19,341
<i>When you second-guess your faith</i>

1707
02:21:19,508 --> 02:21:22,553
<i>When you turn around</i>

1708
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:26,807
<i>And realize that no one else</i>

1709
02:21:26,932 --> 02:21:29,393
<i>Will believe in you</i>

1710
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:33,981
<i>Only yourself</i>

1711
02:21:34,148 --> 02:21:37,776
<i>When you're holding on</i>

1712
02:21:37,943 --> 02:21:41,655
<i>You can't find the will to breathe</i>

1713
02:21:41,822 --> 02:21:45,284
<i>Can you right the wrong</i>

1714
02:21:45,451 --> 02:21:49,079
<i>That has brought you to your knees</i>

1715
02:21:49,246 --> 02:21:52,666
<i>Though you barely lived your life</i>

1716
02:21:52,833 --> 02:21:56,712
<i>You keep on believing you'll survive</i>

1717
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:04,470
<i>And all that's left is what's inside</i>

1718
02:22:04,636 --> 02:22:11,935
<i>Amazing, I have heard my inner voice</i>

1719
02:22:12,102 --> 02:22:18,276
<i>That I need to rejoice</i>

1720
02:22:18,443 --> 02:22:21,946
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1721
02:22:22,113 --> 02:22:26,534
- <i>And way down</i>
- <i>Never thought that I would need</i>

1722
02:22:26,701 --> 02:22:32,749
<i>Amazing but now that I am free</i>

1723
02:23:28,889 --> 02:23:34,395
<i>Amazing and now I'm</i>

1724
02:23:34,562 --> 02:23:41,736
<i>Free</i>

1725
02:23:41,902 --> 02:23:46,657
<i>Amazing, now</i>

1726
02:23:46,824 --> 02:23:52,163
<i>I am free</i>

1727
02:23:52,329 --> 02:23:55,082
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>A hurricane forever</i>

1728
02:23:55,249 --> 02:23:57,084
<i>Imagine you lie down forever</i>

1729
02:23:57,251 --> 02:23:59,920
<i>Could you stand forever</i>
<i>Could you hold it together</i>

1730
02:24:00,045 --> 02:24:01,839
<i>I can't even explain the pain</i>

1731
02:24:02,006 --> 02:24:04,675
<i>Imagine if your life</i>
<i>was like a hurricane</i>

1732
02:24:04,842 --> 02:24:06,719
<i>A hurricane forever</i>
<i>Imagine you lie down</i>

1733
02:24:06,886 --> 02:24:08,929
<i>Forever, ever, ever</i>

1734
02:24:09,096 --> 02:24:12,600
<i>Could you hold it together</i> <i>Yo,
I can't explain the pain with words</i>

1735
02:24:12,725 --> 02:24:15,478
<i>You know what I'm sayin, 'Just imagine</i>
<i>if your life was like a hurricane</i>

1736
02:24:15,644 --> 02:24:18,105
<i>The clouds cracked</i>
<i>and the heaven's gate was stormed</i>

1737
02:24:18,272 --> 02:24:20,733
<i>God placed it on man</i>
<i>on the day he was born</i>

1738
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:23,444
<i>Convicted minutes after</i>
<i>a true natural disaster</i>

1739
02:24:23,611 --> 02:24:26,447
<i>Framed for manslaughter</i>
<i>The Hurricane Carter rising</i>

1740
02:24:26,614 --> 02:24:29,116
<i>Come up from south water</i>
<i>like torrential rain</i>

1741
02:24:29,283 --> 02:24:31,494
<i>In the ring</i>
<i>no opponent escaped unscathed</i>

1742
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:34,038
<i>You can't believe</i>
<i>The world we live in is unjust</i>

1743
02:24:34,205 --> 02:24:36,415
<i>All I see is more proof</i>
<i>There's no place for us</i>

1744
02:24:36,582 --> 02:24:39,251
<i>They had my man Carter</i>
<i>locked in a cage like an animal</i>

1745
02:24:39,376 --> 02:24:42,214
<i>Robbed him to a point</i>
<i>where the mind worked mechanical</i>

1746
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:45,258
<i>Or worse by remote control</i>
<i>It was done to all of us</i>

1747
02:24:45,425 --> 02:24:47,177
<i>They tapped directly into our soul</i>

1748
02:24:47,344 --> 02:24:49,888
<i>Either up at Sing-Sing</i>
<i>or these bars around our mind</i>

1749
02:24:50,055 --> 02:24:52,182
<i>There's nowhere to run</i>
<i>Nowhere to hide</i>

1750
02:24:52,307 --> 02:24:55,018
<i>And it's six-by-six</i>
<i>a guilty man cried</i>

1751
02:24:55,185 --> 02:24:57,604
<i>For penitence and losses</i>
<i>where innocence is</i>

1752
02:24:57,771 --> 02:25:00,774
<i>Hurricane</i>
<i>Could you lie down forever</i>

1755
02:25:06,279 --> 02:25:11,076
<i>Your life was like a hurricane</i> <i>A hurricane

<i>Could you stand it</i>
<i>Could you live for that</i>

1757
02:25:14,162 --> 02:25:17,040
<i>Tough for that</i>
<i>Chunk of that to know the pain</i>

<i>Your life was like a hurricane</i>
