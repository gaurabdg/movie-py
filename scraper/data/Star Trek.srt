1
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,803
U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:23,737
Starfleet Base, we have sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?

3
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:25,239
Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?

4
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,209
Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.

5
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,539
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,079
What you have sent us
doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,441
Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:35,607
- Report.
- It's still out of visual range.

9
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,550
- Give me 20 seconds.
- Alert Captain Robau....

10
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,817
that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.

11
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,289
Polarize the viewscreen.

12
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,825
Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?

13
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,258
Captain, we have visual.

14
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:48,354
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, Lieutenant.

15
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,898
You're 75,000 kilometers from...

16
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,865
Captain, are you seeing this?

17
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:55,528
My God.

18
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,957
I have a reading.

19
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,926
- They have locked weapons on us.
- Red alert.

20
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:22,089
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

21
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,222
- mark 2.
- Arm weapons.

22
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:26,964
Evasive pattern Delta-five.

23
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,165
Incoming fast.

24
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,175
Fire all phasers. Damage report.

25
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:42,445
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like it.

26
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,646
Weapons are off-line. Main power 38%.

27
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,620
- They're firing another.
- All power to forward shields.

28
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,898
Lieutenant.

29
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,667
Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.

30
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,742
- Were our shields even up?
- Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

31
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:08,743
- We have confirmed casualties, sir.
- Shields 11 % and dropping.

32
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,312
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

33
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:14,782
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,046
Hello.

35
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,951
My commander requests
the presence of your Captain

36
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,390
in order to negotiate a cease-fire.

37
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,429
You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.

38
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:30,158
Your refusal would be unwise.

39
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,279
Walk with me.

40
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:53,517
If I don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

41
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,319
- Sir, we could issue...
- There is no help for us out here.

42
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,859
Use autopilot.

43
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,561
- And get off this ship.
- Aye, Captain.

44
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,859
You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk.

45
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,964
His heart rate's elevated.

46
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:43,025
Look at this ship.

47
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,430
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

48
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:52,669
- Is it him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

49
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,405
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

50
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,863
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

51
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,727
I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

52
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:24,134
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

53
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,936
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

54
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,509
Where are you from?

55
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,854
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again.

56
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,948
Bravo-six maneuver. Fire full spread.

57
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:56,566
- Seventeen more out.
- I am initiating General Order 13.

58
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,402
- We're evacuating.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:06,947
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

60
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,984
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

61
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:10,882
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

62
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,420
You will deliver in the shuttle. Go.

63
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:22,025
Move. This one's closed.
Let's go. Get him up.

64
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,592
I am on my way.

65
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:26,967
- George.
- You're okay. Thank God.

66
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:30,072
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

67
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,998
- Yes.
- Everything's going to be okay.

68
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:36,169
- Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

69
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,442
- Our baby, it's coming now.
- I am on my way.

70
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,752
Autopilot function
has been destroyed.

71
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,016
Manual operation only.

72
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,585
Clear those decks now.
Get to the shuttles. Move.

73
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:56,893
Move, move. Get to the hangar deck.
Get to the hangar deck. Let's move it.

74
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,295
- That was a big one.
- Just keep breathing. You will be fine.

75
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:04,168
- And the baby, too, right?
- And the baby, too.

76
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,777
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

77
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,486
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?

78
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:21,216
- Yes, sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

79
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,884
- We're waiting on you, sir.
- No, just go. Take off immediately.

80
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,192
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:28,090
No, wait. We can't go yet.

82
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,491
Please stop. Stop.

83
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:38,236
George? The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

84
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:39,869
Sweetheart, listen to me.

85
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:42,608
I am not going to be there.

86
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,872
- No.
- This is the only way you will survive.

87
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,609
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here.

88
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,810
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

89
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,945
George, I can't do this without you.

90
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,422
Okay, I need you to push now.

91
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:14,594
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

92
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:16,165
A boy?

93
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:18,904
Tell me about him.

94
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,537
He's beautiful.

95
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,205
George, you should be here.

96
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,316
Impact alert.

97
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,945
- What are we going to call him?
- We can name him after your father.

98
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:37,450
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

99
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:42,354
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

100
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,867
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

101
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,774
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?
- I hear you.

102
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:58,506
I love you so much. I love you...

103
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,827
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

104
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,272
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet?

105
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,488
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet?

106
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,963
You get your ass back home now.

107
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:25,407
You live in my house, buddy.

108
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,695
You live in my house,
and that's my car.

109
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:30,670
You get one scratch on that car,
and I am going to whip your...

110
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:45,386
Yeah.

111
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:56,295
Hey, Johnny.

112
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:18,544
Citizen. Pull over.

113
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:46,964
No.......

114
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,136
Is there a problem, Officer?

115
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,804
Citizen, what is your name?

116
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,577
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

117
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,528
What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?

118
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,231
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

119
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,607
One-point-two-six.

120
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:46,697
An ellipse.

121
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,606
What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?

122
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:50,541
Positive two-thirds.

123
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:55,481
What is the square root of 2,396,324?

124
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,449
- 1,548.
- What is the dimensionality...

125
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,249
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

126
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,087
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

127
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:07,856
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

128
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
Spock.

129
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:17,328
I presume you have prepared
new insults for today.

130
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,105
Affirmative.

131
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:30,945
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

132
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:34,045
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and therefore
have no place in this universe. Look.

133
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:37,023
He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

134
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:40,618
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

135
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:47,328
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

136
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,989
They called you a traitor.

137
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:25,205
Emotions run deep within our race.

138
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,742
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

139
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:32,371
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

140
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:37,581
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

141
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,884
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan,

142
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,586
and yet, you married a human.

143
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,822
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty

144
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,627
to observe
and understand human behavior.

145
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:53,997
Marrying your mother was

146
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:56,766
logical.

147
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:04,143
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

148
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:10,315
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

149
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,449
This is something only you can decide.

150
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,725
Spock, come here, let me see you.

151
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,402
- No.
- Spock.

152
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:39,611
There's no need to be anxious.
You will do fine.

153
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,076
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

154
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:45,915
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

155
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:47,880
Okay.

156
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:58,761
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

157
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:05,303
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

158
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,841
and purge all emotion,

159
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:13,211
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

160
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,547
Spock.

161
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:23,356
As always, whatever you choose to be,

162
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,656
you will have a proud mother.

163
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,102
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

164
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:39,071
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

165
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:43,205
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

166
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,678
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

167
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,806
Logical, but unnecessary.

168
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:50,977
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

169
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,553
It is truly remarkable, Spock,

170
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,954
that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

171
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:57,954
All rise.

172
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,028
If you would clarify, Minister,

173
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,425
- to what disadvantage are you referring?
- Your human mother.

174
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,711
Council. Ministers, I must decline.

175
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:19,508
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

176
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,311
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

177
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:26,115
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

178
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:28,519
Why did you come
before this council today?

179
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,149
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

180
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,320
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

181
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:38,925
Thank you, Ministers,
for your consideration.

182
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,667
Live long and prosper.

183
00:19:58,654 --> 00:19:59,882
- How are you?
- Hey.

184
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,021
- Hi.
- Hi.

185
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:16,962
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics,

186
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:20,974
- two Cardassian Sunrises and...
- Got to try the Slusho. It's good.

187
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:22,668
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

188
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,440
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

189
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,644
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

190
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,947
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

191
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,783
Don't you want to at least
know my name

192
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,379
before you completely reject me?

193
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:38,517
- I am fine without it.
- You are fine without it.

194
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:40,758
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

195
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:46,193
If you don't tell me your name,
I am going to have to make one up.

196
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,695
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

197
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:51,272
That's the name
I was going to make up for you.

198
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,705
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

199
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,401
They don't have last names
in your world?

200
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,876
Uhura is my last name.

201
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:00,142
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

202
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:02,876
Excuse me, buddy.

203
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:06,045
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

204
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:08,623
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

205
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:13,423
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

206
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,824
It means you have got a talented tongue.

207
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,860
I am impressed.

208
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,958
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

209
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,973
- who only has sex with farm animals.
- Well, not only.

210
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:29,537
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

211
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:32,170
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

212
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,272
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

213
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:38,649
- Hey, you better mind your manners.
- Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

214
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:43,418
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

215
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:47,086
So get some more guys,
and then it will be an even fight.

216
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,891
Guys, stop it.

217
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,698
Stop it.

218
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,451
Enough.

219
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:27,532
Guys, he's had enough.

220
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,772
Outside, all of you.

221
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,269
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,474
- He wouldn't even listen.
- I just bought a drink.

223
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:41,446
- Can you believe this?
- It's not really fair.

224
00:22:41,446 --> 00:22:44,110
- Come on.
- You all right, son?

225
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,052
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

226
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,557
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

227
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:53,719
- And who am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

228
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,893
Can I get another one?

229
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,731
For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.

230
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:05,967
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

231
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,541
He sure learned his lesson.

232
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,233
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

233
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,574
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

234
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,706
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

235
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:17,114
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

236
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:20,120
- Why are you talking to me, man?
- Because I looked up your file

237
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,816
while you were drooling on the floor.

238
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:26,656
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

239
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,560
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

240
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,360
Maybe I love it.

241
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,163
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

242
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,762
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

243
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:40,802
Something special?

244
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:45,142
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

245
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,281
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

246
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:53,582
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

247
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:58,559
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

248
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:02,263
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

249
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:04,298
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada...

250
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:07,300
- Are we done?
- I am done.

251
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:16,401
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

252
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:24,011
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

253
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:29,286
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

254
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,493
I dare you to do better.

255
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:58,878
Nice ride, man.

256
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:04,083
It's yours.

257
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:07,414
Four years? I will do it in three.

258
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,867
At ease, gentlemen.

259
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:47,061
- Never did get that first name.
- You need a doctor.

260
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,589
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor.

261
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:50,387
You need to get back to your seat.

262
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,257
I had one in the bathroom....

263
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:53,759
with no windows. You need to get back to
your seat now. I suffer from aviaphobia.

264
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,336
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

265
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:59,533
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I will make you sit down.

266
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:04,076
- Fine.
- Thank you.

267
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:08,179
This is Captain Pike.
We have been cleared for takeoff.

268
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,075
I may throw up on you.

269
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,449
I think these things are pretty safe.

270
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,920
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

271
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,321
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

272
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:20,259
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

273
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,297
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

274
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:26,697
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

275
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:30,363
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

276
00:27:30,363 --> 00:27:34,272
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

277
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,435
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

278
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,878
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

279
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:42,040
All I got left is my bones.

280
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:51,289
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

281
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:42,270
Captain Nero. You have been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

282
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,174
Ayel says it's time.

283
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:54,619
Sir, we have arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

284
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:56,987
- What are your orders?
- We wait.

285
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:01,455
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

286
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,929
as we have been doing for 25 years.

287
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:07,997
- And once we have killed him?
- Kill him?

288
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:11,963
I am not going to kill him.
I am going to make him watch.

289
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:27,752
Capture that ship.

290
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:31,153
Welcome back, Spock.

291
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,457
Why are you so happy?

292
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:38,897
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, I don't suppose you do.

293
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,490
Hello, ladies.

294
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:42,729
- I am taking the test again.
- You got to be kidding.

295
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:44,566
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

296
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:45,833
You know, I have got better things to do

297
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,000
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

298
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,508
I am a doctor, Jim. I am busy.

299
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:51,875
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

300
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,642
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

301
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:57,809
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

302
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,386
I got to study.

303
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:01,747
Study, my ass.

304
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:09,486
- Jim, I think I love you.
- That is so weird.

305
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:11,860
- Lights.
- Lights on.

306
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,224
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

307
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:16,395
- Yeah, I did, but...
- You don't love me, too?

308
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:17,835
Oh, my God, my roommate.

309
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,133
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

310
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,071
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

311
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,768
- Under...
- Look, just get under the bed.

312
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:24,538
- Come on.
- She can't see you here.

313
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,045
- Why not?
- Because I promised her

314
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,375
- I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
- Really?

315
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,178
- Well, how many guys have you...
- Just down. Just down.

316
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:33,511
- Hey.
- Hey.

317
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:35,055
- How are you?
- Good.

318
00:30:35,055 --> 00:30:38,216
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

319
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,089
Yeah, I thought all night.

320
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:44,564
I was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

321
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:48,295
- Really?
- Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

322
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:49,929
- No.
- Yeah.

323
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,563
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

324
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,643
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

325
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:01,308
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

326
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:03,714
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

327
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:05,342
You could hear me breathing?

328
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,977
- You.
- Big day tomorrow.

329
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:09,784
- You're going to fail. Get out.
- Gaila, see you around.

330
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,324
If I pass,
will you tell me your first name?

331
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:13,155
- No. Good night.
- I think the fact

332
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:16,025
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

333
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,298
We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.

334
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,371
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

335
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,336
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

336
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:28,466
"Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

337
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:30,939
"Captain."

338
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:33,744
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

339
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:36,612
- and are locking weapons on us.
- That's okay.

340
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:39,419
- That's okay?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

341
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:41,948
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?

342
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,854
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

343
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:47,093
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

344
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:49,789
- I don't suppose this is a problem either.
- They're firing, Captain.

345
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,859
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members

346
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:54,093
from the damaged ship.

347
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,931
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

348
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,733
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

349
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,307
Alert Medical.

350
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:05,135
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

351
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:07,305
- I understand.
- Well, should we, I don't know,

352
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,882
fire back?

353
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,981
- No.
- Of course not.

354
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,554
What is this? What's going on?

355
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:26,395
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

356
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:28,662
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

357
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:29,998
Are they?

358
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,401
No. They're not.

359
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,499
Fire on all enemy ships.

360
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:38,238
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

361
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:41,247
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

362
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:48,787
- All ships destroyed, Captain.
- Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

363
00:32:48,787 --> 00:32:52,553
So. We have managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

364
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,252
no one onboard was injured,

365
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:59,732
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.

366
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:07,070
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

367
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,245
I do not know.

368
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:15,475
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

369
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,977
James T. Kirk, step forward.

370
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:22,652
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

371
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,487
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

372
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:29,051
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

373
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:33,634
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

374
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:38,235
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

375
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:44,402
Step forward, please.

376
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:48,642
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

377
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:52,709
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

378
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:57,447
- Commander?
- Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

379
00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:59,925
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

380
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:02,895
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

381
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:07,225
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular, you cheated.

382
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,801
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

383
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:15,842
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

384
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:17,844
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

385
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:20,506
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

386
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:24,176
- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
- Then not only did you violate the rules,

387
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,253
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

388
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:27,844
Please, enlighten me.

389
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:30,151
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

390
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,419
a captain cannot cheat death.

391
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,858
I of all people?

392
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:40,264
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel

393
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,029
before being killed in action, did he not?

394
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,899
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

395
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,132
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

396
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:49,733
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose is to experience fear,

397
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,613
fear in the face of certain death.

398
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:56,844
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

399
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,352
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

400
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,388
Excuse me, sir.

401
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:13,490
We have received a distress call
from Vulcan.

402
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,661
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

403
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:21,174
I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

404
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:31,710
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I don't know, but I like him.

405
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:39,221
Fugeman, Regula One.
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut.

406
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,592
McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise.
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott.

407
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:46,189
Rader, U.S.S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.

408
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,528
He didn't call my name.

409
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:55,936
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

410
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,575
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

411
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:00,546
That means you're grounded until the
Academy Board rules. All right, listen up.

412
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:03,412
I am going to read this list one
time, and one time only.

413
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:08,346
Jim, the Board will rule in your favor.
Most likely.

414
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,616
- Look, Jim, I got to go.
- Yeah.

415
00:36:13,928 --> 00:36:15,828
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

416
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,599
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

417
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,705
Damn it.

418
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:37,782
- Come with me.
- U.S.S. Newton. Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut.

419
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:41,616
Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares.
Go to your stations and good luck.

420
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:47,789
- Bones, where are we going?
- You will see.

421
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:51,622
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

422
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:54,099
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

423
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,329
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate

424
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:59,565
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

425
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,938
"an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies"

426
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:05,410
- in subspace transmissions tests?
- Consistently, yes.

427
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,481
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

428
00:37:07,481 --> 00:37:10,608
is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,
I am assigned to the Farragut?

429
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:13,880
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

430
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,456
No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.

431
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,754
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

432
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:25,926
- What are you doing?
- I am doing you a favor.

433
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:27,661
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

434
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:31,034
Take a seat. I am going to give you
a vaccine against viral infection

435
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:34,973
- from Melvaran mud fleas.
- What for?

436
00:37:34,973 --> 00:37:37,271
- To give you the symptoms.
- What are you talking about?

437
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,608
You're going to start to lose vision
in your left eye.

438
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:40,874
Yeah, I already have.

439
00:37:40,874 --> 00:37:43,677
Oh, and you're going to get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

440
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,912
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah. You owe me one.

441
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:52,885
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

442
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,484
Medical code states the treatment

443
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,586
and transport of a patient is
to be determined

444
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:59,757
at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

445
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,732
So I am taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

446
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:04,202
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

447
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:06,136
why the Enterprise
warped into a crisis

448
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,073
without one of its senior
medical officers?

449
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:12,635
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

450
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:34,229
- I might throw up on you.
- Jim, you have got to look at this.

451
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:36,598
- Jim, look.
- What?

452
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:37,671
Look.

453
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:38,327
We need to get you changed. I don't feel
right. I feel like I am leaking.

454
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:41,094
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

455
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,815
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

456
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,924
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

457
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:06,323
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

458
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:09,828
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

459
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:13,833
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

460
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:17,099
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

461
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,502
Helm, thrusters.

462
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,938
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

463
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:23,203
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

464
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,284
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

465
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:40,451
- Set a course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

466
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:44,163
Maximum warp. Punch it.

467
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:02,979
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

468
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:06,144
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

469
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:07,721
I am Hikaru Sulu.

470
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:11,155
- And you are a pilot, right?
- Very much so, sir.

471
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:14,626
I am not sure what's wrong here.

472
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:18,665
- Is the parking brake on?
- No. I will figure it out. I am just...

473
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:22,031
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

474
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,133
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

475
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,206
- Where are we?
- Medical Bay.

476
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,149
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

477
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:40,948
- Hi. How are you?
- Come here.

478
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:44,582
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

479
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:47,786
- I am going to give you a mild sedative.
- I wish I didn't know you.

480
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:49,692
Don't be such an infant.

481
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:52,656
How long is it supposed to...

482
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:54,699
Unbelievable.

483
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:58,503
- Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
- Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

484
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:02,406
- Chanko? Cherpov?
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

485
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:06,037
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

486
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:07,842
Yes, sir. Happy to.

487
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:12,380
Ensign authorization code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

488
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,454
Authorization not recognized.

489
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:16,716
Ensign authorization code

490
00:42:16,716 --> 00:42:21,090
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

491
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:25,964
May I have your attention, please?

492
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:32,000
At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.

493
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,571
What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

494
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:40,606
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command

495
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:44,340
that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.

496
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:48,651
Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan

497
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:52,021
and assist in evacuations if necessary.

498
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:57,325
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.

499
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:03,699
- Lightning storm.
- Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

500
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:07,336
- Good God, man.
- What?

501
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,511
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine, damn it.

502
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,774
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone.

503
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:16,581
Yes, sir.

504
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,386
...appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

505
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:23,984
- Hey.
- We got to stop the ship.

506
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:28,255
Jim. I am not kidding.
We need to keep your heart rate down.

507
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:29,961
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

508
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:32,191
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

509
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:35,427
- We're flying into a trap.
- Damn it, Jim, stand still.

510
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:38,303
Stop it.

511
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:48,945
- Uhura. Uhura...
- Kirk. What are you doing here?

512
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,983
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

513
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:53,019
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

514
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:55,054
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

515
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:56,646
- What?
- And was the ship...

516
00:43:56,646 --> 00:43:57,815
Was the ship what?

517
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,325
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

518
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:02,396
- Numb tongue?
- I can fix that.

519
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:04,430
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

520
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,329
- What? I...
- Romulan.

521
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:07,560
- Romulan?
- Yeah.

522
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,965
- Yes.
- Yes?

523
00:44:09,665 --> 00:44:10,636
Damn it.

524
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:47,203
Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.

525
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:50,501
- Jim.
- What's going on?

526
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:51,635
- Jim, come back.
- Kirk.

527
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:53,542
- Captain. Captain Pike, sir...
- Jim, come back here.

528
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,080
...we have to stop the ship.
Kirk, how the hell

529
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,706
did you get onboard
the Enterprise?

530
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:58,546
Captain, this man's under the influence of

531
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:00,142
- a severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, please...

532
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:01,949
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

533
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,489
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

534
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:04,922
It's being attacked by Romulans.

535
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:08,358
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you have
had enough attention for one day.

536
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:09,759
McCoy, take him back to medical.

537
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,422
- We will have words later.
- Aye, Captain.

538
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:12,999
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

539
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:14,829
Mr. Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

540
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,197
- I get it. You're a great arguer.
- By Regulations...

541
00:45:16,197 --> 00:45:17,998
I'd love to do it again.
...that makes him a stowaway.

542
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:19,367
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it.

543
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:20,963
- Kirk...
- This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

544
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:24,044
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

545
00:45:24,044 --> 00:45:25,805
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

546
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:27,642
Based on what facts?

547
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:32,484
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

548
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:34,520
also occurred on the day of my birth,

549
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,455
before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

550
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,583
You know that, sir,
I read your dissertation.

551
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,287
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

552
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:44,091
was never seen or heard from again.

553
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,166
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,

554
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,031
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

555
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:52,570
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

556
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,972
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

557
00:45:55,972 --> 00:45:58,874
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

558
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:04,581
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

559
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:07,319
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

560
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,481
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

561
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:13,419
The cadet's logic is sound.

562
00:46:13,994 --> 00:46:15,985
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

563
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,961
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

564
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:21,000
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

565
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,434
Sir, I am not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

566
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:26,506
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

567
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:28,165
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

568
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:31,335
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:33,135
Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

570
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:35,715
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

571
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:38,011
but we seem to have lost all contact.

572
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:40,814
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission,

573
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:45,358
- or transmission of any kind in the area.
- It's because they're being attacked.

574
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:51,062
Shields up. Red alert.

575
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,068
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

576
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,567
Four, three, two...

577
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:02,773
- Emergency evasive.
- On it, sir.

578
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:12,043
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

579
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:14,211
All stations. Engineer Olson, report.

580
00:47:24,398 --> 00:47:26,127
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

581
00:47:26,127 --> 00:47:27,700
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

582
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:48,979
Sir, there's another Federation ship.

583
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:51,148
- Destroy it, too.
- Fire torpedoes.

584
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,452
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

585
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,993
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

586
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,361
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

587
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,872
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

588
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:09,033
Get me Starfleet Command.

589
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:12,271
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

590
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,607
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

591
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,238
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

592
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:17,442
- and transporter abilities.
- All power to forward shields.

593
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:18,916
Prepare to fire all weapons.

594
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:26,082
- Weapons ready.
- Wait.

595
00:48:26,593 --> 00:48:29,153
- The hull. Magnify.
- Yes, sir.

596
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:36,194
Captain, we're being hailed.

597
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:38,431
Hello.

598
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:43,241
I am Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

599
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:45,402
Hi, Christopher. I am Nero.

600
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:47,343
You have declared war
against the Federation.

601
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:50,508
Withdraw, I will agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

602
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:53,916
- at a neutral location.
- I do not speak for the Empire.

603
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,511
We stand apart.

604
00:48:57,057 --> 00:49:00,788
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

605
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,260
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

606
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,062
No, we're not. Not yet.

607
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:13,301
Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.

608
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:18,369
Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.

609
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:22,880
As you can see by the rest of
your armada, you have no choice.

610
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:27,446
You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

611
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:29,487
That is all.

612
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,430
- He will kill you. You know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

613
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,503
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

614
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:45,333
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

615
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,099
I understand that.

616
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:51,139
I need officers who have been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

617
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:54,476
- I have training, sir.
- Come with me.

618
00:49:55,382 --> 00:49:57,680
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

619
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,481
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

620
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:23,542
Prepare the red matter.

621
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:26,309
Yes, sir.

622
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:07,046
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

623
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:09,179
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

624
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:14,192
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

625
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:17,289
You will land on that machine
they have lowered into the atmosphere

626
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:20,525
that's scrambling our gear.
You will get inside, you will disable it,

627
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:21,931
then you will beam back to the ship.

628
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:25,527
Mr. Spock, I am leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.

629
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:28,139
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

630
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,143
you will contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

631
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:33,042
And if all else fails, fall back

632
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:35,205
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

633
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:36,714
Kirk, I am promoting you to first officer.

634
00:51:36,714 --> 00:51:38,182
- What?
- Captain?

635
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:41,277
Please, I apologize, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

636
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:45,950
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I am not the Captain, you are.

637
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,357
Let's go.

638
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:53,696
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

639
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:56,132
Well, I guess you will have to come
and get me.

640
00:51:56,132 --> 00:51:58,704
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

641
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,673
Dr. Puri, report.

642
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,652
It's McCoy.
Dr. Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

643
00:52:16,523 --> 00:52:19,822
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

644
00:52:19,822 --> 00:52:21,394
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

645
00:52:22,562 --> 00:52:24,530
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward.

646
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:28,397
Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.

647
00:52:28,397 --> 00:52:30,902
Interval check shows
positive and steady.

648
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:33,596
- You got the charges, right?
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:36,505
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

650
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:38,475
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

651
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:45,876
Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.

652
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:00,132
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

653
00:53:00,132 --> 00:53:01,598
Fencing.

654
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:06,099
Pre-jump.

655
00:53:10,444 --> 00:53:13,936
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.

656
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,354
Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.

657
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:25,448
We have one shot
to land on that platform.

658
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:28,755
They may have defenses,
so pull your chute as late as possible.

659
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:31,797
Three, two, one.

660
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,728
Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back

661
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:37,303
until you turn off that drill.

662
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:40,363
Good luck.

663
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:04,887
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

664
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,397
Twenty thousand meters.

665
00:54:31,058 --> 00:54:33,253
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 meters.

666
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:37,353
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 meters.

667
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,067
Forty-six hundred meters
from the platform.

668
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:43,568
Forty-five hundred meters to target.

669
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,038
Four thousand meters.

670
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:49,267
- Three thousand meters.
- Three thousand meters.

671
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:51,469
- Two thousand meters.
- Pulling chute.

672
00:54:57,317 --> 00:55:00,616
- Two thousand meters.
- Come on, pull your chute, Olson.

673
00:55:00,987 --> 00:55:03,820
No, not yet. Not yet. 1,500 meters.

674
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:07,485
- Olson, open your chute.
- Olson, pull your chute.

675
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:09,289
One thousand meters.

676
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:15,725
No.

677
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:22,969
Olson.

678
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:25,610
Olson is gone, sir.

679
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:47,494
Kirk has landed, sir.

680
00:57:51,258 --> 00:57:53,886
Give me your hand. Come on.

681
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,964
Olson had the charges.

682
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,030
I know.

683
00:58:06,306 --> 00:58:08,501
- What do we do?
- This.

684
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:24,620
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are reestablished.

685
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,125
- Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
- Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

686
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,661
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

687
00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:31,958
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

688
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,637
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

689
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:41,934
Launch the red matter.

690
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,084
Kirk to Enterprise. They
just launched something at the planet

691
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:01,524
through the hole they just drilled.

692
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:03,988
- Do you copy, Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,587
- Analyzing data now.
- Transporter is now operational.

694
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,497
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

695
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:10,660
If my calculations are correct,

696
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,833
they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

697
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:21,611
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

698
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:24,377
- Yes, sir.
- How long does the planet have?

699
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:28,350
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

700
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:31,917
Alert Vulcan Command Center
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

701
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:33,390
- all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, wait.

702
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,256
- Maintain standard orbit.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:59:35,256 --> 00:59:37,421
- Where are you going?
- To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

704
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:39,521
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

705
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:41,725
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

706
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,269
It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.

707
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:46,066
I must get them myself.

708
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:48,367
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye.

709
00:59:51,878 --> 00:59:54,458
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

710
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,678
Stand by.
Locking on your signal.

711
00:59:56,683 --> 00:59:59,948
- Retract the drill. Let's move out.
- Yes, sir. Pull it up.

712
01:00:03,423 --> 01:00:06,051
I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move.

713
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,820
- Kirk.
- Sulu.

714
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:16,626
Sulu.

715
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,170
Hold on.

716
01:00:23,643 --> 01:00:25,338
I got you. Now pull my chute.

717
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:37,583
Kirk to Enterprise. We're falling
without a chute. Beam us up.

718
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,555
I am trying. I can't lock on
to your signal. Beam us up.

719
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:41,286
- You're moving too fast.
- Beam us up.

720
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,656
I can do that. I can do that.

721
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:46,159
- Take the conn.
- Aye, sir.

722
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:47,324
The black hole's expanding.

723
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:49,732
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

724
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:53,096
Move, move, move, move, move.

725
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,037
I can do that. I can do that.
Move, move, move, move.

726
01:00:55,675 --> 01:00:57,802
Quick, give me manual control.
I can lock on.

727
01:00:57,802 --> 01:00:59,242
Beam us up.

728
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:02,814
Enterprise, where are you?

729
01:01:02,814 --> 01:01:04,611
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

730
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:08,016
Now, now, now. Do it now.
Now, now, now, now.

731
01:01:08,016 --> 01:01:13,582
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on.
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

732
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,121
Gotcha.

733
01:01:29,476 --> 01:01:32,411
- Thanks.
- No problem.

734
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:37,345
Clear the pad.
I am beaming to the surface.

735
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:39,846
The surface of what?

736
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,450
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

737
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:44,620
Spock, you can't do that.

738
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,316
- Energize.
- Spock.

739
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:26,861
- Spock.
- The planet has only seconds left.

740
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:28,126
We must evacuate.

741
01:02:29,102 --> 01:02:30,433
Mother, now.

742
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,199
- Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
- Locking volume.

743
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,360
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

744
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:07,869
Transport in five, four, three, two...

745
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:12,512
- Mother.
- Im losing her.

746
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:14,617
Im losing her. Im losing her.

747
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:17,814
- No. I lost her.
- I lost her.

748
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:17,377
Acting Captain's Log,
Stardate 2258.42.

749
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:20,711
We have had no word
from Captain Pike.

750
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:23,616
I have therefore classified him

751
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:26,590
a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.

752
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:28,924
Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet

753
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:31,690
and most of its six billion inhabitants.

754
01:04:33,366 --> 01:04:35,698
While the essence of our culture
has been saved

755
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:38,862
in the elders
who now reside upon this ship,

756
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,134
I estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.

757
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,811
I am now a member
of an endangered species.

758
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:18,774
Im sorry.

759
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:22,544
Im sorry.

760
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:25,884
Im so sorry.

761
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:41,957
What do you need? Tell me.

762
01:05:42,935 --> 01:05:44,163
Tell me.

763
01:05:52,712 --> 01:05:57,740
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

764
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:06,749
Okay.

765
01:06:25,678 --> 01:06:28,340
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

766
01:06:29,015 --> 01:06:30,983
I only have one for you.

767
01:06:32,652 --> 01:06:36,986
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

768
01:06:36,986 --> 01:06:39,649
specifically those surrounding Earth.

769
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:44,625
Christopher, answer my question.

770
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,789
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

771
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:49,697
- against a peaceful planet.
- No, I prevented genocide.

772
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:58,569
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

773
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:01,579
I chose a life of honest labor

774
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:05,879
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

775
01:07:05,879 --> 01:07:10,649
I was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing

776
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:14,123
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

777
01:07:14,123 --> 01:07:17,126
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

778
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:19,095
No, you're confused.

779
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:21,359
You have been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

780
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,900
Its out there right now.

781
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,993
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

782
01:07:24,993 --> 01:07:26,969
It has happened. I watched it happen.

783
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:30,133
I saw it happen.
Don't tell me it didn't happen.

784
01:07:34,247 --> 01:07:38,547
And when I lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

785
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:43,582
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

786
01:07:43,582 --> 01:07:46,453
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

787
01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:49,621
But I did not forget the pain.

788
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:54,533
Its a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

789
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:58,467
My purpose, Christopher,

790
01:07:58,467 --> 01:08:02,200
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

791
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:08,404
but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

792
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:14,078
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

793
01:08:15,521 --> 01:08:19,924
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

794
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:21,926
starting with yours.

795
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:25,356
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

796
01:08:29,435 --> 01:08:32,632
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defenses.

797
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:37,100
Centaurian slugs.

798
01:08:38,277 --> 01:08:40,507
They latch on to your brain stem

799
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:44,844
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

800
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:47,719
Frequencies, please, sir.

801
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:50,648
Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...

802
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:52,155
As you wish.

803
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:01,664
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

804
01:09:01,664 --> 01:09:04,861
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

805
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:07,633
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Earth may be his next stop,

806
01:09:07,633 --> 01:09:10,573
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

807
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,143
Out of the chair.

808
01:09:12,143 --> 01:09:16,442
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

809
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:19,211
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

810
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:20,910
That is not it.

811
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,453
He said he wanted me
to see something,

812
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:23,954
the destruction of my home planet.

813
01:09:23,954 --> 01:09:26,115
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

814
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:28,193
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

815
01:09:28,193 --> 01:09:30,091
The engineering comprehension
necessary

816
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:33,654
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

817
01:09:33,654 --> 01:09:36,064
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

818
01:09:36,064 --> 01:09:38,295
to create a tunnel through space-time.

819
01:09:38,295 --> 01:09:40,429
Damn it, man,
Im a doctor, not a physicist.

820
01:09:40,429 --> 01:09:42,166
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

821
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:45,266
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable,

822
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:47,471
- must be the truth.
- How poetic.

823
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:51,346
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

824
01:09:51,346 --> 01:09:53,941
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

825
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:55,714
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

826
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:57,789
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

827
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:59,983
We are technologically outmatched
in every way.

828
01:09:59,983 --> 01:10:02,219
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

829
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:05,092
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

830
01:10:05,092 --> 01:10:07,290
Then what about
assigning engineering crews...

831
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,766
...to try and boost our warp yield?
Remaining power and crew are being...

832
01:10:09,766 --> 01:10:11,734
...used to repair radiation leaks on the
lower decks.... okay. All right.

833
01:10:11,734 --> 01:10:13,566
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which

834
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:15,401
- we cannot contact Starfleet.
- There's got to be some way...

835
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:17,840
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet

836
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,672
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

837
01:10:19,672 --> 01:10:21,303
There won't be a next engagement.

838
01:10:21,303 --> 01:10:24,315
By the time we have gathered,
it will be too late.

839
01:10:24,315 --> 01:10:26,817
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's going to happen?

840
01:10:26,817 --> 01:10:29,046
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

841
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:32,716
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

842
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:35,555
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

843
01:10:35,555 --> 01:10:37,286
beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin,

844
01:10:37,286 --> 01:10:38,385
culminating in the events of today,

845
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:40,931
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

846
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,763
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

847
01:10:43,763 --> 01:10:45,393
An alternate reality.

848
01:10:46,338 --> 01:10:47,506
Precisely.

849
01:10:48,174 --> 01:10:52,167
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

850
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:54,837
our destinies have changed.

851
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:57,415
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

852
01:10:57,415 --> 01:10:58,778
Spock, don't do that.

853
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:02,650
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive....

854
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,916
waste of time. These are the orders issued
by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

855
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,821
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

856
01:11:06,821 --> 01:11:08,393
Spock, you are Captain now.

857
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:09,927
You have to make... I am aware
of my responsibilities,

858
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:12,395
Mr. Kirk. Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

859
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:14,466
That is correct, and why
Im instructing you to accept the fact

860
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:17,092
- that I alone am in command.
- I will not allow us to go backwards...

861
01:11:17,092 --> 01:11:18,795
Jim, he's the Captain.
...away from the problem,

862
01:11:18,795 --> 01:11:22,431
- instead of hunting Nero down.
- Security, escort him out.

863
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:32,111
- Hey.
- Enough, Jim.

864
01:11:38,023 --> 01:11:39,718
Get him off this ship.

865
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:03,060
- Computer, where am I?
- Location, Delta Vega.

866
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,259
Class-M planet. Unsafe.

867
01:12:05,259 --> 01:12:08,633
There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometers to the northwest.

868
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:12,633
Remain in your pod until retrieved by Starfleet
authorities. You got to be kidding me.

869
01:12:55,218 --> 01:12:58,483
Stardate 2258.42.

870
01:12:59,222 --> 01:13:03,090
Or 44. Whatever.

871
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:06,821
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

872
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:11,492
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

873
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:13,831
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

874
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,168
James T. Kirk.

875
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:30,970
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

876
01:15:33,009 --> 01:15:34,977
How do you know my name?

877
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,708
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

878
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,079
- Look, I don't know you.
- I am Spock.

879
01:15:53,029 --> 01:15:54,018
Bullshit.

880
01:15:54,697 --> 01:15:57,928
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

881
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,594
Especially after the events of today.

882
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:04,564
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today,

883
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:08,508
but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

884
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:11,102
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

885
01:16:11,102 --> 01:16:13,114
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

886
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:15,150
You are not the captain?

887
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:23,584
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

888
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,255
By Nero.

889
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:34,328
What do you know about him?

890
01:16:34,771 --> 01:16:37,331
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

891
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:44,112
- Please, allow me. It will be easier.
- What are you doing?

892
01:16:44,112 --> 01:16:46,807
Our minds, one and together.

893
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:52,019
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

894
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:56,148
a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

895
01:16:57,326 --> 01:17:00,921
That is where Im from,
Jim, the future.

896
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:11,499
A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.

897
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:15,677
I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.

898
01:17:21,017 --> 01:17:23,212
We outfitted our fastest ship.

899
01:17:24,654 --> 01:17:27,088
Using red matter,
I would create a black hole

900
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:29,124
which would absorb the exploding star.

901
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,758
I was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.

902
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:38,290
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

903
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,767
I had little time.

904
01:17:48,477 --> 01:17:52,345
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

905
01:18:09,165 --> 01:18:11,599
As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.

906
01:18:11,968 --> 01:18:15,836
He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.

907
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:20,501
In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.

908
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:31,909
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

909
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:42,590
Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.

910
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,757
But what was years for Nero

911
01:18:46,302 --> 01:18:48,236
was only seconds for me.

912
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:51,432
I went through the black hole.

913
01:18:53,643 --> 01:18:55,975
Nero was waiting for me.

914
01:19:01,817 --> 01:19:04,945
He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.

915
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:09,518
He captured my vessel
and spared my life,

916
01:19:10,826 --> 01:19:12,316
for one reason.

917
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:15,694
So that I would know his pain.

918
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:21,601
He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.

919
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:25,934
As he was helpless to save his planet,

920
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:29,339
I would be helpless to save mine.

921
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:36,474
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

922
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,447
Because I failed.

923
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:45,983
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

924
01:19:53,602 --> 01:19:56,196
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

925
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,065
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

926
01:20:00,443 --> 01:20:03,276
Jim, we must go.

927
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:07,038
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

928
01:20:07,984 --> 01:20:11,852
Wait. Where you came from,

929
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:16,252
did I know my father?

930
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,484
Yes.

931
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:23,458
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

932
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:27,296
He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.

933
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,232
Captain?

934
01:20:29,232 --> 01:20:32,466
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

935
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,116
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

936
01:20:43,116 --> 01:20:45,847
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

937
01:20:45,847 --> 01:20:49,356
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor.

938
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,058
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

939
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:56,029
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

940
01:20:56,029 --> 01:20:57,756
Is that a thank-you?

941
01:20:57,756 --> 01:21:00,529
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

942
01:21:00,529 --> 01:21:02,399
Permission to speak freely, sir.

943
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:07,342
- I welcome it.
- Do you? Okay, then.

944
01:21:07,676 --> 01:21:10,076
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

945
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:12,647
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

946
01:21:12,647 --> 01:21:14,511
Probably. But the right one?

947
01:21:14,511 --> 01:21:16,050
You know, back home we got a saying,

948
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,551
"If you're going to ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

949
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:19,951
"you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable."

950
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:21,318
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

951
01:21:21,318 --> 01:21:25,758
as a stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

952
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:28,159
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision.

953
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,526
I intend to assist in the effort

954
01:21:29,526 --> 01:21:32,192
to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

955
01:21:32,192 --> 01:21:36,168
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

956
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:39,241
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

957
01:21:40,509 --> 01:21:41,806
Excuse me.

958
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:47,681
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

959
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:26,447
Hello.

960
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:10,223
What?

961
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:16,201
You realize how unacceptable this is?

962
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:17,704
- Fascinating.
- What?

963
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:19,239
Okay, Im sure you're just
doing your job,

964
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:21,138
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

965
01:23:21,138 --> 01:23:22,471
Six months Ive been here,

966
01:23:22,471 --> 01:23:25,672
living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal.

967
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,475
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

968
01:23:28,475 --> 01:23:30,449
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

969
01:23:30,449 --> 01:23:32,418
For something
that was clearly an accident.

970
01:23:32,418 --> 01:23:35,319
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

971
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:37,483
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

972
01:23:37,483 --> 01:23:40,721
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

973
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:43,457
- Me.
- Get aff. Shut up.

974
01:23:43,457 --> 01:23:45,932
You don't eat anything.
You can eat, like, a bean,

975
01:23:45,932 --> 01:23:49,493
and you're done.
Im talking about food. Real food.

976
01:23:49,493 --> 01:23:52,005
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

977
01:23:52,005 --> 01:23:54,007
You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott

978
01:23:54,007 --> 01:23:56,304
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

979
01:23:56,304 --> 01:23:59,677
That's what Im talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

980
01:23:59,677 --> 01:24:01,249
I had a little debate with my instructor

981
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:05,446
on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

982
01:24:05,446 --> 01:24:09,456
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

983
01:24:09,456 --> 01:24:11,048
was limited to about 100 miles.

984
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:13,856
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

985
01:24:13,856 --> 01:24:15,931
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

986
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,692
which is easy, by the way,

987
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:19,199
I could do it with a life-form.

988
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,464
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

989
01:24:22,464 --> 01:24:26,200
- I know that dog. What happened to it?
- Ill tell you when it reappears.

990
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,173
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

991
01:24:28,173 --> 01:24:31,144
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

992
01:24:31,144 --> 01:24:34,478
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is traveling at warp speed?

993
01:24:34,478 --> 01:24:37,074
I think if that equation had been
discovered, Id have heard about it.

994
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:39,051
The reason you haven't heard of it,
Mr. Scott,

995
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:41,952
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

996
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:50,295
- Are you from the future?
- Yeah, he is. Im not.

997
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,694
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

998
01:24:53,694 --> 01:24:55,496
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

999
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:59,472
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

1000
01:24:59,472 --> 01:25:00,667
On youse go.

1001
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:03,802
So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?

1002
01:25:03,802 --> 01:25:05,573
She is one well-endowed lady.

1003
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:07,672
Id like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1004
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:10,547
if you will pardon
the engineering parlance.

1005
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:14,215
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right,

1006
01:25:14,215 --> 01:25:17,815
where you're from, what Ive done,
which I don't, by the way,

1007
01:25:17,815 --> 01:25:20,394
you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise

1008
01:25:20,394 --> 01:25:23,329
while she's traveling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1009
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:26,230
Get off there. Its not a climbing frame.

1010
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:30,965
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1011
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:33,940
whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

1012
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,032
What's that?

1013
01:25:35,032 --> 01:25:38,204
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1014
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:42,006
Get out of it.

1015
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:47,080
Imagine that.

1016
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,352
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1017
01:25:50,352 --> 01:25:52,757
You're coming with us, right?

1018
01:25:54,396 --> 01:25:58,025
- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
- Your...

1019
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:01,195
He... The other Spock
is not going to believe me.

1020
01:26:01,195 --> 01:26:02,395
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened. Under...

1021
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:05,234
....no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1022
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:06,399
You must promise me this.

1023
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:09,636
You're telling me I can't tell you
that Im following your own orders?

1024
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:13,306
- Why not? What happens?
- Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1025
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:16,907
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

1026
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:20,078
- How? Over your dead body?
- Preferably not.

1027
01:26:20,078 --> 01:26:23,181
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1028
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:26,455
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer

1029
01:26:26,455 --> 01:26:29,622
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand

1030
01:26:29,622 --> 01:26:31,700
must resign said command.

1031
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:38,032
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1032
01:26:38,032 --> 01:26:41,132
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1033
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:45,245
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

1034
01:26:46,215 --> 01:26:48,979
What you must do is get me to show it.

1035
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:52,576
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1036
01:26:56,059 --> 01:27:00,051
No, go. You cannot come with me.
Go on.

1037
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:04,594
You know, coming back in time,
changing history,

1038
01:27:05,134 --> 01:27:06,567
that's cheating.

1039
01:27:08,804 --> 01:27:11,068
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1040
01:27:19,982 --> 01:27:22,678
Live long and prosper.

1041
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:44,271
Mr. Scott.

1042
01:27:49,445 --> 01:27:51,675
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

1043
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:00,948
Hold on a second.

1044
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:02,813
Oh, no.

1045
01:28:06,462 --> 01:28:08,054
Don't worry, I...

1046
01:28:18,874 --> 01:28:19,898
No. No.

1047
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,252
Turbine release valve activated.

1048
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:51,405
You all right? You all right?

1049
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:55,976
My head's buzzing and Im soaked,
but otherwise Im fine.

1050
01:28:56,211 --> 01:29:02,081
Captain Spock. Detecting unauthorized
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

1051
01:29:02,081 --> 01:29:03,344
Bring up the video.

1052
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:09,216
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1053
01:29:09,216 --> 01:29:12,191
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1054
01:29:12,191 --> 01:29:13,419
Set phasers to stun.

1055
01:29:25,474 --> 01:29:26,964
- Halt.
- No, no.

1056
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:33,711
Come with me, cupcake.

1057
01:29:42,024 --> 01:29:43,048
- Who are you?
- Im with him.

1058
01:29:43,048 --> 01:29:45,490
- He's with me.
- We are traveling at warp speed.

1059
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,152
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1060
01:29:47,152 --> 01:29:48,456
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1061
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:51,692
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

1062
01:29:51,692 --> 01:29:54,792
Well, Im not telling, Acting Captain.

1063
01:29:55,337 --> 01:29:56,361
What, did...

1064
01:29:56,361 --> 01:29:59,531
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1065
01:29:59,531 --> 01:30:02,201
- That doesn't make you angry.
- Are you a member of Starfleet?

1066
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:04,677
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1067
01:30:04,677 --> 01:30:06,941
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me

1068
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:09,381
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1069
01:30:09,381 --> 01:30:10,917
- Well...
- Don't answer him.

1070
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:12,714
You will answer me.

1071
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:17,947
- Id rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1072
01:30:19,895 --> 01:30:22,261
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered,

1073
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:25,458
- and you're not even upset.
- If you are presuming

1074
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:28,536
that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship,

1075
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,366
- you are mistaken.
- And yet, you are the one

1076
01:30:30,366 --> 01:30:33,270
who said fear was necessary
for command. I mean,

1077
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:36,776
did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1078
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:39,371
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1079
01:30:39,371 --> 01:30:41,711
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1080
01:30:41,711 --> 01:30:43,978
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

1081
01:30:43,978 --> 01:30:47,385
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1082
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:49,149
Or the need to stop at nothing

1083
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:51,248
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1084
01:30:51,248 --> 01:30:53,293
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing.

1085
01:30:53,293 --> 01:30:55,556
It must not even compute for you.

1086
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:57,389
You never loved her.

1087
01:31:22,457 --> 01:31:23,583
Spock.

1088
01:32:01,096 --> 01:32:03,621
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1089
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:05,556
I hereby relinquish my command,

1090
01:32:05,556 --> 01:32:09,694
based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

1091
01:32:09,694 --> 01:32:12,865
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1092
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,361
I like this ship. You know, it's exciting.

1093
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,607
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1094
01:32:46,607 --> 01:32:51,042
Now we have got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1095
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:53,240
Yeah, we do.

1096
01:32:53,882 --> 01:32:56,407
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1097
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:59,611
- You got to be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1098
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:06,049
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1099
01:33:07,863 --> 01:33:09,262
So do I.

1100
01:33:13,902 --> 01:33:16,268
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.

1101
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:22,069
Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1102
01:33:22,577 --> 01:33:25,910
I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,

1103
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:28,380
but Im ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1104
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:31,714
I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.

1105
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:35,851
Either we're going down or they are.

1106
01:33:37,459 --> 01:33:38,687
Kirk out.

1107
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:48,033
Speak your mind, Spock.

1108
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:52,633
That would be unwise.

1109
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:56,742
What is necessary is never unwise.

1110
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:01,276
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1111
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:06,016
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1112
01:34:07,823 --> 01:34:09,723
I am grateful for this.

1113
01:34:11,726 --> 01:34:13,091
And for you.

1114
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:18,294
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

1115
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:21,862
An anger I cannot control.

1116
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:31,101
I believe that she would say,

1117
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:34,205
"Do not try to."

1118
01:34:35,617 --> 01:34:40,486
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1119
01:34:44,526 --> 01:34:46,687
I married her because I loved her.

1120
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:57,233
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1121
01:34:57,233 --> 01:35:00,139
We can't just go in there guns blazing,
Jim, not with their technology.

1122
01:35:00,139 --> 01:35:02,369
Im telling you, the math doesn't support what
you're suggesting. Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.

1123
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:04,604
- Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Mr. Chekov. What is it?

1124
01:35:04,604 --> 01:35:06,806
Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan,

1125
01:35:06,806 --> 01:35:10,146
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1126
01:35:10,146 --> 01:35:13,517
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he will destroy us.

1127
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:15,954
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1128
01:35:15,954 --> 01:35:20,687
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

1129
01:35:20,687 --> 01:35:23,389
the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings

1130
01:35:23,389 --> 01:35:25,693
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1131
01:35:25,693 --> 01:35:28,166
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated,

1132
01:35:28,166 --> 01:35:31,433
- we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
- Aye, that might work.

1133
01:35:32,173 --> 01:35:33,731
Wait a minute, kid. How old are you?

1134
01:35:33,731 --> 01:35:36,538
- Seventeen, sir.
- Oh, good, he's 17.

1135
01:35:36,538 --> 01:35:38,272
Doctor.

1136
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:41,781
Mr. Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

1137
01:35:42,183 --> 01:35:44,117
If Mr. Sulu is able
to maneuver us into position,

1138
01:35:44,117 --> 01:35:46,949
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1139
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:49,819
and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

1140
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:52,587
I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock.

1141
01:35:52,587 --> 01:35:55,720
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1142
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,855
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1143
01:35:57,855 --> 01:36:01,094
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1144
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,438
Also, my mother was human,

1145
01:36:04,438 --> 01:36:07,531
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1146
01:36:13,782 --> 01:36:15,875
Then Im coming with you.

1147
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:20,011
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1148
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:24,554
See? We are
getting to know each other.

1149
01:36:40,575 --> 01:36:41,667
Prepare the drill.

1150
01:36:57,959 --> 01:37:03,454
All stop in three, two, one.

1151
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:11,597
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1152
01:37:11,597 --> 01:37:13,571
Ill do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1153
01:37:13,571 --> 01:37:15,870
- Aye.
- Fire.

1154
01:37:43,171 --> 01:37:45,867
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

1155
01:37:45,867 --> 01:37:48,408
Really? Fine job, Mr. Sulu. Well done.

1156
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:53,377
- How are we, Scotty?
- Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

1157
01:37:56,584 --> 01:37:58,677
Whatever happens, Mr. Sulu,

1158
01:37:58,677 --> 01:38:00,482
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1159
01:38:00,482 --> 01:38:04,149
you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

1160
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:06,853
Yes, sir.

1161
01:38:06,853 --> 01:38:08,518
Otherwise we will contact
the Enterprise

1162
01:38:08,518 --> 01:38:10,954
when we're ready
to be beamed back.

1163
01:38:10,954 --> 01:38:12,259
Good luck.

1164
01:38:25,246 --> 01:38:28,147
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1165
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:32,920
- Ill be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1166
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:52,535
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1167
01:38:52,535 --> 01:38:54,505
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense

1168
01:38:54,505 --> 01:38:55,871
in the design of the enemy ship,

1169
01:38:55,871 --> 01:38:57,911
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1170
01:38:57,911 --> 01:39:00,708
- Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
- Energize.

1171
01:39:44,025 --> 01:39:46,391
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1172
01:39:46,794 --> 01:39:48,853
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1173
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:54,726
Ayel.

1174
01:40:09,517 --> 01:40:10,677
Ill cover you.

1175
01:40:11,186 --> 01:40:13,086
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, I got you.

1176
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:36,206
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

1177
01:40:38,146 --> 01:40:39,738
And Captain Pike.

1178
01:41:02,503 --> 01:41:03,697
Move.

1179
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,298
They have activated the drill.

1180
01:41:07,508 --> 01:41:09,100
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1181
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,677
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1182
01:41:10,677 --> 01:41:12,405
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1183
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:14,071
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1184
01:41:33,334 --> 01:41:34,699
I foresee a complication.

1185
01:41:34,699 --> 01:41:37,396
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1186
01:41:37,396 --> 01:41:40,497
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1187
01:41:40,497 --> 01:41:42,701
Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.

1188
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:44,300
Wow, that's weird.

1189
01:41:45,446 --> 01:41:48,279
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1190
01:41:48,279 --> 01:41:52,820
Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.

1191
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:58,350
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1192
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:00,450
You're going to be able
to fly this thing, right?

1193
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:02,995
Something tells me I already have.

1194
01:42:03,631 --> 01:42:05,155
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1195
01:42:06,367 --> 01:42:09,700
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1196
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:11,829
- It will work.
- In the event that I do not return,

1197
01:42:11,829 --> 01:42:13,930
- please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
- Spock.

1198
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:15,737
Itll work.

1199
01:42:25,553 --> 01:42:27,020
Fascinating.

1200
01:42:35,663 --> 01:42:37,654
Start-up sequence initiated.

1201
01:43:21,276 --> 01:43:24,901
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1202
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:37,658
I know your face from Earth's history.

1203
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:26,262
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1204
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:28,740
He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1205
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:30,174
But that was another life.

1206
01:44:31,045 --> 01:44:34,105
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1207
01:45:06,714 --> 01:45:09,209
Captain Nero.
The Vulcan ship has been taken.

1208
01:45:09,209 --> 01:45:10,912
The drill has been destroyed.

1209
01:45:11,352 --> 01:45:12,319
Spock.

1210
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:15,679
Spock.

1211
01:45:33,341 --> 01:45:34,740
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1212
01:45:36,544 --> 01:45:39,479
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1213
01:45:39,747 --> 01:45:41,806
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1214
01:45:41,806 --> 01:45:43,042
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1215
01:45:43,284 --> 01:45:45,252
- No terms. No deals.
- That ship, take it out.

1216
01:45:45,252 --> 01:45:46,547
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1217
01:45:46,547 --> 01:45:48,087
- you will destroy...
- I want Spock dead now.

1218
01:46:04,071 --> 01:46:05,868
- He went to warp, sir.
- Go after him.

1219
01:46:05,868 --> 01:46:07,201
Yes, sir.

1220
01:46:37,405 --> 01:46:40,431
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1221
01:46:41,842 --> 01:46:43,901
- I can't...
- You can't what?

1222
01:46:43,901 --> 01:46:45,602
You can't even speak.

1223
01:46:48,215 --> 01:46:50,945
- What?
- I got your gun.

1224
01:47:17,678 --> 01:47:18,736
What's he doing?

1225
01:47:19,213 --> 01:47:22,080
Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.

1226
01:47:22,883 --> 01:47:23,872
Fire everything.

1227
01:47:31,258 --> 01:47:35,456
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1228
01:47:35,456 --> 01:47:36,961
Understood.

1229
01:47:43,304 --> 01:47:44,794
Captain, Ive picked up another ship.

1230
01:48:06,627 --> 01:48:09,755
- What are you doing here?
- Just following orders.

1231
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:30,742
Enterprise, now.

1232
01:48:54,175 --> 01:48:55,904
Nice timing, Scotty.

1233
01:48:56,844 --> 01:49:00,780
Ive never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before.

1234
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:02,712
- Jim.
- Bones.

1235
01:49:02,712 --> 01:49:04,444
I got him.

1236
01:49:06,654 --> 01:49:07,678
That was pretty good.

1237
01:49:09,023 --> 01:49:12,220
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power. Their shields are down, sir.

1238
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:13,725
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1239
01:49:48,929 --> 01:49:51,762
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1240
01:49:52,233 --> 01:49:53,564
Your ship is compromised.

1241
01:49:53,564 --> 01:49:56,158
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1242
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:58,067
which we are willing to provide.

1243
01:50:01,442 --> 01:50:03,842
- Captain, what are you doing?
- Showing them compassion

1244
01:50:03,842 --> 01:50:05,639
may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

1245
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:08,738
Its logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

1246
01:50:08,738 --> 01:50:11,545
No, not really. Not this time.

1247
01:50:11,545 --> 01:50:16,112
I would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.

1248
01:50:16,112 --> 01:50:20,455
I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.

1249
01:50:20,455 --> 01:50:22,358
You got it.

1250
01:50:22,358 --> 01:50:25,296
Arm phasers. Fire everything we have got.
Yes, sir.

1251
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:12,775
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:26,149
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1253
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:28,455
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1254
01:51:28,455 --> 01:51:29,893
You bet your ass, Captain.

1255
01:51:33,567 --> 01:51:35,592
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well.
Its got us.

1256
01:51:35,592 --> 01:51:39,161
- Go to maximum warp. Push it.
- Im giving her all she's got, Captain.

1257
01:51:48,549 --> 01:51:49,982
All she's got isn't good enough.

1258
01:51:49,982 --> 01:51:53,451
- What else you got?
- Okay, if we eject the core and detonate,

1259
01:51:53,451 --> 01:51:54,816
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1260
01:51:54,816 --> 01:51:56,082
I cannot promise anything, though.

1261
01:51:59,727 --> 01:52:01,160
Do it, do it, do it.

1262
01:52:02,396 --> 01:52:04,193
- Clear the area. Go.
- Yes, sir.

1263
01:53:31,785 --> 01:53:33,343
Father.

1264
01:53:41,729 --> 01:53:43,458
I am not our father.

1265
01:53:51,138 --> 01:53:55,768
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1266
01:53:58,946 --> 01:54:00,072
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1267
01:54:00,072 --> 01:54:02,080
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1268
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:05,618
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you

1269
01:54:05,618 --> 01:54:08,347
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1270
01:54:08,347 --> 01:54:13,620
of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realize.

1271
01:54:15,562 --> 01:54:17,655
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1272
01:54:17,655 --> 01:54:21,132
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1273
01:54:21,132 --> 01:54:23,635
- should he break his promise.
- You lied.

1274
01:54:25,105 --> 01:54:27,198
I... I implied.

1275
01:54:27,775 --> 01:54:29,766
- A gamble.
- An act of faith.

1276
01:54:30,878 --> 01:54:34,041
One I hope that you will repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1277
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:35,775
In the face of extinction, it is only logical

1278
01:54:35,775 --> 01:54:38,579
I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1279
01:54:38,579 --> 01:54:40,949
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

1280
01:54:42,289 --> 01:54:44,985
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1281
01:54:45,459 --> 01:54:49,759
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1282
01:54:49,759 --> 01:54:53,560
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor.

1283
01:54:55,102 --> 01:54:58,333
Put aside logic. Do what feels right.

1284
01:55:04,244 --> 01:55:07,907
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1285
01:55:07,907 --> 01:55:09,243
I shall simply say

1286
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:11,749
good luck.

1287
01:55:22,696 --> 01:55:26,359
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1288
01:55:27,034 --> 01:55:30,401
Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1289
01:55:30,401 --> 01:55:33,166
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1290
01:55:33,166 --> 01:55:38,074
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1291
01:55:39,146 --> 01:55:42,081
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1292
01:55:46,787 --> 01:55:48,755
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1293
01:55:48,755 --> 01:55:52,917
you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise,

1294
01:55:52,917 --> 01:55:54,721
for duty as his relief.

1295
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:05,365
I relieve you, sir.

1296
01:56:05,806 --> 01:56:07,603
I am relieved.

1297
01:56:09,443 --> 01:56:11,968
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

1298
01:56:13,947 --> 01:56:15,778
Your father would be proud.

1299
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:46,906
Thrusters on full.

1300
01:56:47,514 --> 01:56:50,278
Maneuvering thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1301
01:56:50,278 --> 01:56:53,044
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1302
01:56:53,044 --> 01:56:55,747
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1303
01:57:00,294 --> 01:57:03,092
Bones. Buckle up.

1304
01:57:07,668 --> 01:57:09,135
Scotty, how we doing?

1305
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:11,898
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1306
01:57:12,973 --> 01:57:14,372
Get down.

1307
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:19,311
Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

1308
01:57:22,349 --> 01:57:24,749
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1309
01:57:25,152 --> 01:57:26,881
Permission granted.

1310
01:57:27,654 --> 01:57:29,713
As you have yet to select a first officer,

1311
01:57:29,713 --> 01:57:32,849
respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

1312
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:36,827
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1313
01:57:37,331 --> 01:57:39,595
It would be my honor, Commander.

1314
01:57:43,303 --> 01:57:45,703
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

1315
01:57:47,474 --> 01:57:49,339
Thrusters on standby.

1316
01:57:49,339 --> 01:57:51,741
- Take us out.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

1317
01:57:56,717 --> 01:57:59,948
Space, the final frontier.

1318
01:58:01,788 --> 01:58:05,246
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1319
01:58:06,293 --> 01:58:10,093
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1320
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:14,664
to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations,

1321
01:58:15,135 --> 01:58:19,663
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.
