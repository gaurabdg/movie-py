1
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,581
I never knew the old Vienna
before the war...

2
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,818
with its Strauss music,
its glamor and easy charm.

3
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,551
Constantinople
suited me better.

4
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:30,059
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

5
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,092
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

6
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,093
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs...

7
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,217
but, you know, they can't stay
the course like a professional.

8
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,523
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know,

9
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,323
each occupied by a power- the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

10
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,862
But the center of the city,
that's international,

11
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:51,860
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

12
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:55,521
Wonderful! What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place...

13
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:57,892
and none of them
could speak the same language,

14
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:00,554
except a sort of smattering
of German.

15
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,858
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

16
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,692
Vienna doesn't really look any worse than a lot
of other European cities. Bombed about a bit.

17
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:10,890
Oh, wait. I was gonna tell you
about Holly Martins,

18
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:14,055
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

19
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:16,326
The name was Lime.
Harry Lime.

20
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:19,524
Now, Martins was broke, and Lime
had offered him some sort of a job.

21
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,861
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

22
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,325
- Passport, please.
- Oh.

23
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:40,525
- What's the purpose of your visit here?
- A friend offered me a job.

24
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,363
- Where are you staying?
- With him. 15 Stiffgasse.

25
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,593
- His name?
- Lime. Harry Lime.

26
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,657
- Okay.
- Thought he'd be here to meet me.

27
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,201
- Speak English?
- English?

28
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:33,729
A little, little.

29
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,373
Ten minutes too late.

30
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,737
- Already gone.
- Who?

31
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:45,433
Mmm, his friends
and, uh, no-

32
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,474
- Uh, coffin.
- Coffin?

33
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,667
Mr. Lime's.
An accident.

34
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:54,572
Knocked over by a car,
here in front of the house.

35
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:58,938
Have seen it myself.
Killed at once, immediately.

36
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,533
Already in hell...
or in heaven.

37
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,703
Sorry for the gravediggers.
Hard work. It is frost.

38
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:23,573
Can you tell me, uh,
who's the-

39
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,873
A fellow called Lime.

40
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:58,057
Like a lift to town?
I've got a car here.

41
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,190
Thanks.

42
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:17,290
- My name's Calloway.
- Martins.

43
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,348
- You a friend of Lime?
- Yeah.

44
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:23,859
- Been here long?
- No.

45
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:36,019
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't
you? You could do with a drink.

46
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:38,993
- Could you buy me one?
- Of course.

47
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,119
- Thanks.
- Schmolka?

48
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:45,889
I guess nobody knew Harry
like he did, or like I did.

49
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:50,122
- How long ago?
- Back in school.

50
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:53,629
I was never so lonesome
in my life till he showed up.

51
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,218
- When did you see him last?
- September, '39.

52
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:58,354
- When the business started?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,590
- See much of him before that?
- Once in a while.

54
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:04,426
- Best friend I ever had.
- That sounds like a cheap novelette.

55
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:09,795
Well, I write cheap novelettes.

56
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,956
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
What's your name again?

57
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,429
- Holly Martins.
- No, sorry.

58
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:18,624
You ever hear of
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?

59
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,790
Can't say that I have.

60
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:24,230
Death at Double-X Ranch?
Uh, raunch.

61
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,266
- Nope.

62
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:31,197
He must've known I was broke.
He even sent me an airplane ticket.

63
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,063
- It's a shame.
- What?

64
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:37,124
Him dying like that.

65
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,792
Best thing that
ever happened to him.

66
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,958
What are you trying to say?

67
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,695
He was about the worst
racketeer in this city.

68
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:48,029
- Policeman, huh?
- Come on, have another drink.

69
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,626
No, I never did like policemen.
I have to call them sheriffs.

70
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,600
- Ever seen one?
- Pin it on a dead man.

71
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,966
Some petty racket
with gasoline or something.

72
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:03,059
Just like a cop.
You're a real cop, I suppose.

73
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,263
- It wasn't petrol.
- So it wasn't petrol.

74
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,201
So it was tires
or saccharin or-

75
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,431
Why don't you catch
a few murderers for a change?

76
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:15,801
Well, you could say that murder
was part of his racket.

77
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:21,638
It's all right, Paine. He's only
a scribbler with too much drink in him.

78
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,228
Take Mr. Holly Martins home.

79
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:28,238
Holly Martins, sir?
The, uh, the writer?

80
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,739
The author of
Death at Double-X Ranch?

81
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,364
- Listen, Callaghan-
- Calloway. I'm English.

82
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,373
You're not going to close your
files at a dead man's expense.

83
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:40,203
So you're going to find me the real
criminal? Sounds like one of your stories.

84
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,866
When I'm finished with you,
you'll leave Vienna.

85
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,874
Here's some army money. It should see
you through tonight at Sacher's Hotel,

86
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,306
if you don't drink too much
in the bar.

87
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,137
We'll keep a seat for you
on tomorrow's plane.

88
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,903
Please be careful, sir.
Up we come.

89
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,966
- Written anything lately?
- Take him to Sacher's.

90
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,441
Don't hit him again
if he behaves.

91
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,305
And you go carefully there.
It's a military hotel.

92
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:11,709
I'm so glad to have met you, sir.
I've read quite a few of your books.

93
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,539
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- I like a good western.

94
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:18,101
That's what I like about them. You can
pick them up and put them down anytime.

95
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,111
- Oh, Mr. Hartman?
- Yes, sir?

96
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,702
Mr. Calloway said this gentleman's
got to have a room for the night.

97
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,712
Passport, please.

98
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,075
Can't very well
introduce you to everybody.

99
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,977
Would you mind
filling this in?

100
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,036
- Mr. Crabbin.
- What is it, sergeant?

101
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,239
- Mr. Holly Martins, the author.
- Who?

102
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,712
- Thought you might be interested.
- Never heard of him.

103
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,713
He's very good, sir.
I've read quite a few of his books.

104
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,044
Author? Martins?
Thank you, sergeant.

105
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,206
Mr. Martins?
My name's Crabbin.

106
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,942
I represent
the C.R.S. of G.H.Q.

107
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,108
- You do?
- Yes. Cultural Reeducation Section.

108
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,706
Propaganda. Very important
in a place like this.

109
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,715
We do a little show each week.
Last week we had Hamlet.

110
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,510
The week before
we had... something.

111
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,517
- The striptease, sir.
- Yes, the Hindu dancers. Thank you.

112
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,550
This is the first opportunity
of making an American author welcome.

113
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,912
- Welcome?
- I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins.

114
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:13,849
On Wednesday night, we're having a
little lecture on the contemporary novel.

115
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,885
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

116
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:19,884
Nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, sergeant?

117
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,713
- Very popular.
- Are you staying long?

118
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:25,719
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

119
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:28,616
Listen, Mr. Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest,

120
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,380
- we'd be delighted to have you.

121
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,785
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

122
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:37,287
- He's due to leave tomorrow.
- Have you got a toothache.

123
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:40,252
- Number 8, Mr. Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

124
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:43,378
- I know a very good dentist.
- I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.

125
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:46,445
Goodness. We must report that.
Were they trying to rob you?

126
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,453
Oh, just a soldier. I was trying
to punch his major in the eye.

127
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:52,283
- A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

128
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,515
I've heard of him,
but I didn't exactly know him.

129
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,023
- I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
- Goodness, that's awkward.

130
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,615
Is that what you say to people after
death? Goodness, that's awkward?

131
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,123
- Mr. Martins? Excuse me. Telephone.
- Who is it?

132
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,385
- Baron Kurtz.
- Must be some mistake. Yes?

133
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,982
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

134
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,219
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.
Come around.

135
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,781
Austrians aren't allowed
in your hotel.

136
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,518
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Cafe?
- Where?

137
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:23,524
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

138
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:27,786
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

139
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,485
Be there in a moment.
Wait a minute.

140
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:33,221
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

141
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,226
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

142
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:38,386
- Did you ever read The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
- No, not that one.

143
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:41,758
It's a story about a man who hunted down a
sheriff who was victimizing his best friend.

144
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,852
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

145
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,123
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

146
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:49,218
Sounds anti-British, sir.

147
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:05,395
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

148
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:08,920
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

149
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,759
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

150
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:18,889
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

151
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,591
- Tension?
- Suspense.

152
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,100
- You really liked it?
- At the end of every chapter you are left guessing.

153
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,429
So, you were
a friend of Harry's?

154
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,762
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

155
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:35,665
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

156
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:41,099
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

157
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:46,100
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

158
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:51,100
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tires on the black market.

159
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,000
I wonder what my father
would have said.

160
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:56,830
I'm afraid the police
meant more than that.

161
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,563
They get rather absurd
ideas sometimes.

162
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:02,431
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

163
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:06,938
Even so, I'm not going to leave
it at this. Would you help me?

164
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:13,668
I wish I could. But,
you know, I am an Austrian.

165
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:16,794
I have to be
careful with the police.

166
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,896
I'm afraid
I can't help you.

167
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:23,336
Except with advice,
of course.

168
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,340
Advice.

169
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,129
We came out of his place
like this...

170
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,834
and were walking this way.

171
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:35,066
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

172
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,802
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

173
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:42,863
It was just about here.

174
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,968
- Here?
- Yes.

175
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,667
His friend and I
picked him up,

176
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:54,198
carried him across over here.

177
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:59,334
- It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

178
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,809
We laid him down
just about here.

179
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,009
And this is where he died.

180
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:09,237
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

181
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,744
What did he say?

182
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,573
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

183
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:18,441
I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

184
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,501
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived,

185
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,239
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

186
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:28,245
But he said he died
instantaneously.

187
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,670
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

188
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:38,544
Well, there was only you and
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

189
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:40,945
A Romanian. Mr. Popescu.

190
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:44,174
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

191
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,744
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

192
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:55,908
- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

193
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:58,815
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

194
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:01,179
Who used to visit Mr. Lime?

195
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,342
Visit? Eh-

196
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:17,614
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

197
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,319
Excuse me.

198
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,286
Who was at the funeral
besides you?

199
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:35,013
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

200
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:37,451
Wasn't there a girl there?

201
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,715
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

202
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:44,778
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

203
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:48,948
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

204
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:51,749
What's the good
of another postmortem?

205
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:55,586
Suppose you dig up something
discreditable to Harry?

206
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:58,919
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

207
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,649
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

208
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,247
One has to work the best way
one can, you know.

209
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,757
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

210
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,916
I don't think I ever heard it.

211
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,924
You did mention the theater.

212
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,150
Josefstadt.

213
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:17,681
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

214
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,590
You'd do better
to think of yourself.

215
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,455
I'll be all right.

216
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:27,153
Of course.
I'm so glad I've met you.

217
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:31,556
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

218
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:37,256
- Number 8, please.
- Mr. Calloway's compliments.

219
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:40,591
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- Tell the major I won't need it.

220
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,024
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for the Josefstadt Theater.

221
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,254
- Ah, Mr. Martins!
- Good evening, Mr. Crabbin.

222
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,421
He said I was to drive you to the
airfield or the bus, whichever you prefer.

223
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:53,362
Didn't you hear Mr. Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the H.Q.B.M.T.?

224
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,395
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

225
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:54,635
- Afterwards.

226
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,604
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

227
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:19,002
Oh, come in.

228
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,097
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

229
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:24,764
- I enjoyed the play very much.
- Danke. Guten Nacht.

230
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,772
- Guten Nacht.
- You were- You were awfully good.

231
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:32,432
- Do you understand German? - No,
I- Excuse me. I could follow it fine.

232
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:36,441
- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name is Holly Martins.

233
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,269
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

234
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,434
- Would you like some tea? Someone threw me this packet last week.
- Thank you.

235
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,998
Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

236
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:49,099
That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

237
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:52,505
- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

238
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:56,873
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

239
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:02,206
- Yes. - I wanted to talk
to you- No, thank you.

240
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:04,573
I wanted to talk to you about him.

241
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:08,099
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

242
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,236
Well, I saw you
at the funeral.

243
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:14,437
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

244
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,139
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

245
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:23,770
I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

246
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:27,973
I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

247
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,205
Some more tea?

248
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,305
No, no tea.
Would you like a cigarette?

249
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,938
Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

250
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:41,379
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

251
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,506
- Do you know him?
- No.

252
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:46,776
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

253
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,542
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

254
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:52,810
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

255
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,645
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

256
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:58,649
Hmm. He said
he remembered me too.

257
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,741
Seems to show
he wasn't in much pain.

258
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:04,079
Dr. Winkel told me that.

259
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:06,812
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

260
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:11,579
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

261
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,017
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

262
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:17,449
Well, were you
at the inquest?

263
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,453
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

264
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:23,453
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

265
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,452
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:30,851
Well, uh,
I don't get it.

267
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,444
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh, Popescu,

268
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:37,784
his own driver
knocking him over,

269
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:40,378
his own doctor
just passing by.

270
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:42,921
No strangers there at all.

271
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,580
I know. I've wondered
about it a hundred times,

272
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,144
if it really was an accident.

273
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:55,221
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

274
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,279
- But if it wasn't an-
- Frau Schmidt!

275
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,791
I must hurry. They don't like
us to use the lights.

276
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:07,222
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

277
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:12,786
Look, do you know
that porter?

278
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,124
Yes.

279
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:24,784
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

280
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,621
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

281
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:30,785
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

282
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:34,157
Heard. I heard the brakes.

283
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,716
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side...

284
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:41,728
uh, Josef, the Josef-

285
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,284
Emperor Josef statue.

286
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,295
Why didn't they
bring him in the house?

287
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,993
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

288
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:18,465
- Uh, was he- was he still alive?

289
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,727
Ah, alive!
He couldn't have been alive,

290
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,130
not with his head
in the way it was.

291
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,724
I was told that
he did not die at once.

292
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,800
No, I mean that-

293
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:36,027
No, you-

294
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,398
- He was quite dead.
- He was- He was quite dead.

295
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,901
He was quite dead.

296
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:48,401
But this sounds crazy.

297
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:52,300
If he was killed at once, how could he
have talked about me and this lady here?

298
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,234
Why didn't you say all this
at the inquest?

299
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:59,326
Uh, it's better not to be
mixed up in things like this.

300
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,803
Things like what?

301
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,166
I was not the only one
who did not give evidence.

302
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,670
Who else?

303
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,035
Three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue.

304
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:12,628
- Kurtz?
- Yes.

305
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,569
- The Romanian?
- Yes.

306
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,867
- And?
- There was a third man. He didn't give evidence.

307
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,872
- You mean the doctor?
- No, no, no.

308
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,201
He came later, after they
carried him to the Josef statue.

309
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:25,797
What did this man look like?

310
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:27,999
I didn't see his face.

311
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,702
He didn't look up.
He was quite, uh, ordinary.

312
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:41,071
He- He might have been...

313
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:43,075
just anybody.

314
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,808
Just anybody.

315
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:52,471
Hello? Hello.

316
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,677
Hello.

317
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:03,301
Hello?

318
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:08,809
- Who was that?
- I don't know. They didn't answer.

319
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:11,366
But I was told
there were only two men there.

320
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,808
You've got to tell
your story to the police.

321
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:17,333
The police? Why police?

322
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:20,607
It's nonsense! It is all nonsense!
It was an accident

323
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:22,907
You don't know
it was an accident.

324
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,911
- You only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him.

325
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:28,311
I should have listened
to my wife.

326
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:30,973
She said you were
up to no good. Gossip.

327
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:32,980
Suppose I take
your evidence to the police?

328
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:37,541
Now, hold on.

329
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:46,143
I have no evidence.
I- I saw nothing, I said nothing.

330
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,410
- It's not my business.
- We'll make it your business.

331
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,215
Hold on.

332
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:01,748
I have always liked you, but you
must not bring this gentleman again.

333
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:04,579
You must go at once,
please. Please!

334
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:08,086
Please!

335
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:17,318
You shouldn't get
mixed up in this.

336
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:21,514
Well, if I do find out something,
can I look you up again?

337
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:23,917
Why don't you leave
this town? Go home.

338
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,413
- What is it?

339
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:47,416
- What's she talking about?
- The police are searching my room.

340
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,925
- What the devil?
- Getting around, Martins?

341
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:23,653
Oh, pinning things
on girls now.

342
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,852
Miss Schmidt, I should like
to see your papers, please.

343
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:29,724
Don't you give him anything.

344
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,726
Thank you.

345
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:36,686
You were born in Graz
of Austrian parents?

346
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:38,784
Yes.

347
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:40,793
Paine.

348
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,963
Hmm.

349
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:59,557
It's very good, sir,
isn't it, eh?

350
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,824
How much did you pay
for this?

351
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,090
I'm afraid I shall have to keep
this for a while, Miss Schmidt.

352
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:09,393
- How do you expect her to live without her papers?
- Write her out a receipt.

353
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:12,693
- Give her a receipt for those letters too.
- This way, miss.

354
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:15,824
I suppose it wouldn't interest you
to know that Harry Lime was murdered.

355
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:19,490
You're too busy. You haven't even
bothered to get the complete evidence.

356
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,922
- Must you take those?
- They'll be returned, miss.

357
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,762
They are private letters.

358
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,925
That's all right, miss.
Don't worry.

359
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,933
We're used to it.
Like doctors.

360
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:41,934
There was a third man there. I suppose
that doesn't sound peculiar to you.

361
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:46,627
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like
Lime was killed by his friends or by accident.

362
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,726
The only important thing
is that he's dead.

363
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:53,731
- I'm sorry.
- Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?

364
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:55,996
- Calloway.
- Must you take those letters?

365
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,559
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- They're Harry's.

366
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:02,626
- That's the reason.
- You won't learn anything from them.

367
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:06,501
They're only... love letters.
There are not many of them.

368
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:10,005
They'll be returned to you, Miss
Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.

369
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:14,005
There's nothing in them.
Harry never did anything.

370
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:16,834
Only a small thing once,
out of kindness.

371
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:21,099
- And what was that?
- You've got it in your hand.

372
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,605
Major Calloway?

373
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:26,607
- Finished?
- Yes. Okay.

374
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:30,164
You will have to come
with us, Miss Schmidt.

375
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:34,072
- You're not locking her up.
- Go home, Martins, like a sensible chap.

376
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:37,166
- Get the next plane.
- As soon as I get to the bottom of this.

377
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,299
Death's at the bottom
of everything, Martins.

378
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:44,604
Mind if I use that line in my
next western? You can't chuck me out.

379
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:48,609
- Here we are, miss. Your receipt for the letters.
- I don't want it.

380
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:51,609
Well, I've got it
when you want it, miss.

381
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:58,143
Anything really wrong
with your papers?

382
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:03,403
They're forged.

383
00:30:03,478 --> 00:30:05,875
Oh.

384
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,968
Why?

385
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:11,671
The Russians would claim me.
I come from Czechoslovakia.

386
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:39,037
- What'd she say?
- Only complaining about the way they behaved in her house.

387
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:46,413
Give her some cigarettes.

388
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,882
- Uh, cigarettes, hmm?
- Danke.

389
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,349
No, go ahead, take the-

390
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:58,349
Miss Schmidt, ready?

391
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,816
Now, look,

392
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:05,476
I'll straighten out
all this nonsense about Harry.

393
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:08,818
You'll be all right.

394
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:13,744
Sometimes he said
I laughed too much.

395
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:19,818
Oh, what's the name of that doctor?
Harry's doctor?

396
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:23,843
- Dr. Winkel.
- What do you want to see a doctor for?

397
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,716
- A bruised lip.
- Good.

398
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:44,220
Laboratory, we're coming right down.

399
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:52,882
You wait here, Miss Schmidt.

400
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:29,092
- Is Dr. Winkel in?

401
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,150
- Dr. Winkel. I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- Nein.

402
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:36,559
Please, won't you say that
I'm a friend of Harry Lime?

403
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,852
- Bitte.
- Thank you.

404
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,490
- Bittesehr.

405
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,319
Guten Nacht.

406
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:01,557
- Dr. Winkel?
- Vinkel.

407
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:03,791
Uh, Dr. Vinkel.

408
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:07,423
Quite a collection
of, uh... collection.

409
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:09,795
- Yes.

410
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,096
Is that your dog?

411
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,190
Yes. Would you mind, Mr., uh-

412
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,495
- Martins.
- Martins, coming to the point, please?

413
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,692
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

414
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:33,360
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical advisor.

415
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:36,458
- I want to find out all I can.
- Find out?

416
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:39,524
- Yeah, the details.
- I can tell you very little.

417
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:43,695
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

418
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:47,565
- Who was with him?
- Two friends of his.

419
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:50,262
You sure? Two?

420
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:53,269
Quite sure.

421
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:55,600
Could he have been
at all conscious?

422
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,569
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time...

423
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,069
while they carried him
across the road.

424
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:05,127
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

425
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:08,330
Could he have been capable
of making plans...

426
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:12,861
for me and others just,
just during those few moments?

427
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:15,871
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

428
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:19,201
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

429
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:23,639
My opinion is limited
to the causes of death.

430
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:28,396
Have you any reason
to be dissatisfied?

431
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:31,406
Was it possible
that his death...

432
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:34,566
might have been
not accidental?

433
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,604
Could he have been-

434
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:42,801
Could he have been...
pushed, Dr. Winkel?

435
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,974
Vinkel.
I cannot give an opinion.

436
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:54,475
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

437
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:04,310
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

438
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:06,538
Certainly, Brodsky.
What is it?

439
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:11,238
This forgery is very clever,
and we are interested in this case.

440
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:13,302
- Have you arrested the girl?
- No, not yet.

441
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,335
Please, keep this passport to yourself
until I will make some inquiries.

442
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:20,243
- Will you, Major? Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

443
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:22,370
Right, sit down,
Miss Schmidt.

444
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,846
We'll send your letters
and things back to you.

445
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,006
- And my passport?
- We'll need that for a while.

446
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,537
What did he mean?

447
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:38,048
You know as much as I do.

448
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:43,378
Miss Schmidt, you were intimate
with Lime, weren't you?

449
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,211
We loved each other.
Do you mean that?

450
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:48,748
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

451
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:51,182
- Joseph Harbin.
- No.

452
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:55,183
- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

453
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:59,616
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

454
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:01,844
I'm not lying.

455
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:04,579
You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

456
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:09,277
In one of his letters, he asked you to
telephone a good friend of his called Joseph.

457
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:12,286
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

458
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:16,342
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

459
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:20,147
- It wasn't important.
- What was the message?

460
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,879
Something about
meeting Harry at his home.

461
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:26,387
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

462
00:36:26,454 --> 00:36:29,580
We've got to find him.
You can help us.

463
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:34,819
What can I tell you, but you've
got everything upside down.

464
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:40,150
Okay. That American friend
of yours is still waiting for you.

465
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:43,710
He won't do you much good.

466
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:49,321
I thank you, Miss Schmidt.
We'll send for you when we want you.

467
00:36:57,124 --> 00:37:00,558
Hello, Mr. Martins. I've been
trying to get you at your hotel.

468
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,887
I've arranged that lecture
for tomorrow.

469
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:06,015
- Well, what about?
- On the modern novel. You remember what we arranged.

470
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:09,059
- Oh.
- They want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.

471
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,218
- What's that?
- Oh, I thought you'd know. You're a writer.

472
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:15,225
But of course you do. Good night,
old man. I've forgotten my hat.

473
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,726
- I'll let you know the time later.
- Mmm.

474
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,020
- Drink?
- Whiskey.

475
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,151
Two whiskeys.

476
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,953
- Zwei Whisky.
- How much?

477
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,757
- Twenty shillings.
- Oh, they don't take army money here.

478
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,762
How much did he say?

479
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,720
- Harry?
- Yes.

480
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:49,853
He moved his head,
but the rest is good, isn't it?

481
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,423
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening.

482
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,930
You've found out
my little secret.

483
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,488
A man must live.
How goes the investigation?

484
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:16,726
Have you proved
the policemen are wrong?

485
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,265
- Not yet.
- But you will.

486
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,890
Our friend Dr. Winkel said
you had called. Wasn't he helpful?

487
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,956
Well, he was limited.

488
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,966
- But Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

489
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:30,297
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

490
00:38:30,368 --> 00:38:32,460
He's back now.

491
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:35,763
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

492
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,961
I'll bring him to you.

493
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:41,002
Haven't you done
enough for tonight?

494
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:45,730
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

495
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:52,468
Who are you
lookin' for now?

496
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:56,230
Shh. Shh.
Don't. Please don't.

497
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:58,271
Silly lookin' bunch.

498
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,233
- Mr. Popescu, Mr. Martins.
- How do you do?

499
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:06,328
- Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.
- I'll leave you together.

500
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:10,098
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
- Of course.

501
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,230
- I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins.
- Oh, you did?

502
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:16,068
Not a sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger,

503
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,471
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

504
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,495
Humanity is a duty. Cigarette,
Miss Schmidt? Keep the pack.

505
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:25,064
I understand
you were with Harry-

506
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,972
Two double whiskeys.

507
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:35,340
It was a terrible thing. I was just
crossing the road to go to Harry.

508
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:38,672
He and the baron
were on the sidewalk.

509
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:42,470
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross
the road, it wouldn't have happened.

510
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:46,635
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

511
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:51,904
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

512
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:54,273
And the truck-

513
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:58,641
It was terrible, Mr. Martins. Terrible.
I've never seen a man killed before.

514
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:01,678
I think there was something
funny about the whole thing.

515
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,972
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

516
00:40:04,044 --> 00:40:07,307
Of course there was.
Some ice for Mr. Martins.

517
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,175
- You think so too?
- It was so terribly stupid...

518
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:13,701
for a man like Harry to be killed
in an ordinary street accident.

519
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,973
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

520
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,808
Who was the third man?

521
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,711
I oughtn't to drink it.

522
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,906
It makes me acid.

523
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,743
What man would you be
referring to, Mr. Martins?

524
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,747
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

525
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:33,248
I don't know how you got that idea. You'll
find all about it in the police report.

526
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:36,145
There was just the two of us,
me and the baron.

527
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:38,614
Who could have told you
a story like that?

528
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:41,774
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

529
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,781
And saw the accident?

530
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,749
No, he didn't see the accident,
but he saw three men carrying the body.

531
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:50,578
Why wasn't he
at the police inquiry?

532
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,640
He doesn't want
to get involved.

533
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:55,581
You'll never teach these
Austrians to be good citizens.

534
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:58,174
It was his duty
to give the evidence.

535
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,184
Even so, he remembers wrong.

536
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,548
What else did he tell you?

537
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:06,210
That Harry was dead before
you got him to that statue.

538
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:09,047
He probably knows
a lot more than that.

539
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,677
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

540
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:14,776
The police say he was
mixed up in some racket?

541
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:18,650
Oh, that's quite impossible.
He had a great sense of duty.

542
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,312
Your friend Kurtz seems
to think it was possible.

543
00:41:21,388 --> 00:41:25,651
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.
The baron hasn't traveled, you know?

544
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:28,449
He seems to have
been around a bit.

545
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:31,511
Do you know a man
called, uh, Harbin?

546
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,453
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

547
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:36,749
Joseph Harbin? No.

548
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:44,249
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

549
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:48,154
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

550
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,687
He will meet us
at the bridge. Good.

551
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:35,490
Hello! Is it
so very important for you?

552
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:38,084
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

553
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:40,459
I'd like to tell you something.

554
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,461
Tell me, how did the car-

555
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:46,657
Shh, shh. Come tonight.
My wife goes out.

556
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,128
- All right, I'll come back, but-
- Shh. Tonight.

557
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,055
Does that mean come in?

558
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:10,099
Oh, yes, come in.

559
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,256
The porter's going
to talk to us tonight.

560
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,425
Need we go through it
all again?

561
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,897
I can manage by myself.
You busy?

562
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:19,434
Just another part
I've got to learn.

563
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:21,659
Can I hear you?

564
00:43:21,734 --> 00:43:23,791
- In German?
- I can try.

565
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,493
- Is it comedy or tragedy?
- Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

566
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:30,000
- Do I, uh, read-
- Well, you read this.

567
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:33,092
Oh. Well, I-

568
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:39,668
- What's that?
- Uh, Heurigen, I guess.

569
00:43:39,737 --> 00:43:41,998
H- E-Z-T-

570
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:44,592
Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

571
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:47,602
It means
she has to sit down.

572
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,735
Well, uh, Frau Hausman-

573
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:59,530
No, no.
It's no good.

574
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,170
Bad day?

575
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,172
It's always bad around this time.

576
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,171
He used to look in around 6:00.

577
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:16,030
I've been frightened. I've been alone
without friends and money.

578
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:19,402
But I've never known
anything like this.

579
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:24,504
Please talk.
Tell me about him.

580
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:26,506
Tell you what?

581
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:31,166
Oh, anything. Just talk. Where did you
see him last, and what did you do?

582
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:34,300
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

583
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:37,308
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

584
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:42,770
- Oh, that was nine years ago.
- Tell me more.

585
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:46,776
Well, it's very difficult.
You knew Harry.

586
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:49,502
We didn't do anything
very amusing.

587
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:52,542
He just made everything
seem like such fun.

588
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:56,510
- Was he clever when he was a boy?
- He could fix anything.

589
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:59,442
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

590
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:03,673
How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

591
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:06,268
How to avoid this and that.

592
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:08,938
He fixed my papers for me.

593
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:13,776
He heard the Russians were repatriating
people like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

594
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,972
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

595
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,604
Yeah.

596
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,738
When he was 14, he taught me
the three-card trick.

597
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:25,905
- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

598
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:29,106
The world grew up
around him, that's all.

599
00:45:30,747 --> 00:45:33,272
And buried him.

600
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,610
Anna, you'll
fall in love again.

601
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:39,513
Don't you see
I don't want to?

602
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,515
I don't ever want to.

603
00:45:41,582 --> 00:45:44,140
Come on out and have a drink.

604
00:45:44,215 --> 00:45:46,705
Why did you say that?

605
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,249
Seemed like a good idea.

606
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:52,045
It was just what he used to say.

607
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:56,106
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

608
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:58,775
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

609
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:01,943
What's the hurry? Can't we talk
quietly for a couple of minutes?

610
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:05,281
- I thought you wanted- - A moment ago,
you said you didn't want to see the porter.

611
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:08,877
- We're both in it, Harry.
- Holly.

612
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:11,213
I'm so sorry.

613
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:15,116
It's all right.
You might get my name right.

614
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,950
You know, you ought
to find yourself a girl.

615
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:25,043
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

616
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:28,644
- If you'll be good enough to trans-
- Look.

617
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:32,448
- That's Harry's place, isn't it?
- Yes.

618
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:35,455
- Let's go away.
- What's the matter?

619
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:39,784
- Let's not get into any more trouble.
- Wait here.

620
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:47,247
What's the matter?
Uh, what is, los?

621
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:50,621
- I-I don't understand.

622
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:53,523
Um, porter, uh, dead.

623
00:46:53,592 --> 00:46:55,523
Kaputt.

624
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:58,852
The porter is odraht. Kaputt.

625
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,857
- Porter?
- He's murdered.

626
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:02,858
Papa!

627
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,856
Ja, Papa!

628
00:47:25,828 --> 00:47:28,226
I, uh, don't understand.

629
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:41,694
- What is it?
- The porter's been murdered.

630
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,063
They think you did it.

631
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,962
Hello?

632
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:19,162
- Papa!

633
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:01,797
Sneak out the other way and go back to
your theater. I'd better not see you again.

634
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,430
- What are you going to do?
- I wish I knew.

635
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,800
Be sensible.
Tell Major Calloway.

636
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:30,802
- Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
- Oh, Mr. Martins.

637
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:34,671
- It's very urgent. Just get him on the telephone.
- Do you know his number?

638
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:38,175
- No, I don't know his number.
- I'll look it up for you.

639
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,209
- Is there a car here?
- Of course. There's one waiting for you.

640
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,504
- Never mind about the number.

641
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:54,507
Take me to the headquarters-

642
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,410
Hold on! I haven't even
told you where to take me yet!

643
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:08,673
- Driver! Driver!

644
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:12,702
- Slow down!

645
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,678
Have you got orders to kill me?

646
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,973
Ah, ah, ah! Ah, Mr. Martins!
What a relief to see you.

647
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:54,846
I was beginning to think
something had happened to you.

648
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:58,509
Everything's ready for you.
I was frantic in case you hadn't got...

649
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:00,983
my message at the hotel.

650
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:03,780
Porters out here
are so unreliable.

651
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,818
We're all set
for a wonderful meeting.

652
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:08,182
You'll find the audience
most appreciative.

653
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:10,651
Oh, let me take your coat.
I've got it.

654
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,913
There'll be refreshments afterwards.
Come along. Follow me.

655
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:16,476
Well, here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

656
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:18,712
Would you look after those?
Thank you.

657
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:21,652
Would you like to sit there?
That's right.

658
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:25,744
I have much pleasure in introducing
Mr. Holly Martins from the other side.

659
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,686
Well-

660
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:37,085
Bring the car and anyone
else who would like to come.

661
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:40,178
Don't be long. Hmm.

662
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:47,314
Yeah, well, I- I suppose
that is what I meant to say.

663
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,323
Of course, of course.

664
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:54,154
Do you believe, Mr. Martins,
in the stream of consciousness?

665
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:58,487
Stream of consciousness?
Well, uh- Well, uh-

666
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,185
- Well, uh- - What author
has chiefly influenced you?

667
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:05,122
- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

668
00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:08,683
- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr. Martins' little joke, of course.

669
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:12,056
We know perfectly well Zane Grey
wrote what we call westerns.

670
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,116
Cowboys and bandits.

671
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:18,252
Mr. James Joyce-
Now, where would you put him?

672
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,583
Oh, uh, would you mind
repeating that question?

673
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:25,856
I said, where would you put
Mr. James Joyce?

674
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:28,691
In what category?

675
00:52:28,763 --> 00:52:32,422
Can I ask, is Mr. Martins
engaged on a new book?

676
00:52:32,495 --> 00:52:36,361
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

677
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,521
- A novel, Mr. Martins?
- It's a murder story.

678
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:42,893
I've just started it.
It's based on fact.

679
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:46,987
Why, it's Mr. Popescu!
Oh, very great pleasure to see you here.

680
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:51,690
As you know, Mr. Popescu is a very great
supporter of one of our medical charities.

681
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:54,730
Are you a slow writer,
Mr. Martins?

682
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,355
Not when I get interested.

683
00:52:57,431 --> 00:53:00,421
I'd say you were doing something
pretty dangerous this time.

684
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:03,727
- Yeah?
- Mixing fact and fiction.

685
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:07,424
- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr. Martins.

686
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,931
I'd say stick to fiction.
Straight fiction.

687
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,897
I'm too far along
with the book, Mr. Popescu.

688
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:16,058
- Haven't you ever scrapped a book, Mr. Martins?
- Never.

689
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:17,895
Pity.

690
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:22,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
if there are no more questions,

691
00:53:22,568 --> 00:53:25,091
I think I can call the meeting
officially closed.

692
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,827
That's him.

693
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:08,367
Who's there?
Who is it? Who is it?

694
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:13,671
It's all right.
It's all right.

695
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,444
I told you
to go away, Martins.

696
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:23,072
This isn't Santa Fe, I'm not a sheriff
and you aren't a cowboy.

697
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:26,114
You've been blundering around with
the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna,

698
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:28,772
Harry's friends,
and now you're wanted for murder.

699
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:31,337
- Put down drunk and disorderly too.
- I have.

700
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:34,472
- What's the matter with your hand?
- Parrot bit me.

701
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:36,812
Oh, stop behaving
like a fool, Martins.

702
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:40,315
I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur
at it. You're a professional.

703
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:43,146
You've been shaking your
cap and bells all over town.

704
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:46,149
Get me the Harry Lime file,
and get Mr. Martins a whiskey.

705
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,682
I don't need
your drinks, Calloway.

706
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:51,979
You will. I don't want
another murder in this case,

707
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:54,279
so you're going to hear
the facts.

708
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:57,250
You haven't told me
a single one yet.

709
00:55:57,318 --> 00:55:59,910
Have you ever heard
of penicillin?

710
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:01,780
Well?

711
00:56:01,852 --> 00:56:04,615
In Vienna, there hasn't been
enough penicillin to go around.

712
00:56:04,687 --> 00:56:06,846
So a nice trade started here:

713
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:10,010
Stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals,

714
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:13,848
diluting it to make it go further,
and selling it to patients.

715
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:15,853
Do you see what that means?

716
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,080
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes
of penicillin to investigate a murder?

717
00:56:19,154 --> 00:56:21,483
These were murders.

718
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:23,714
Men with gangrened legs,

719
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:26,448
women in childbirth,
and there were children too.

720
00:56:26,522 --> 00:56:30,079
They used some of this diluted
penicillin against meningitis.

721
00:56:30,155 --> 00:56:32,088
The lucky children died.

722
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,588
The unlucky ones went off their heads.
You can see them now in the mental ward.

723
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:38,521
That was the racket
Harry Lime organized.

724
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,783
Calloway, you haven't shown me
one shred of evidence.

725
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:47,051
We're just coming to that.
Paine, magic lantern show.

726
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:49,056
Very good, sir.

727
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:51,251
Paine's one of your devoted readers.

728
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,790
He's promised to lend me one
of your books. Which one is it, Paine?

729
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:55,949
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe, sir.

730
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:59,924
- That's right.
- I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

731
00:56:59,992 --> 00:57:03,153
- Come on, show me what you've got to show.
- All right, Paine?

732
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:04,852
Yes, sir.

733
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:09,249
Paine, Paine, Paine.

734
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:13,420
I got them muddled. It's the new lot
that's just come in for Mr. Crabbin.

735
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:18,487
See this man here?
A fellow called Harbin,

736
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:21,424
a medical orderly
at the General Hospital.

737
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:25,291
He worked for Lime and helped to steal
the stuff from the laboratories.

738
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:30,022
We forced him to give information to us
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

739
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:34,892
But we didn't arrest them, as it might have
spoiled our chances of getting the others.

740
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:38,260
- Next, Paine.
- I'd like a word with this orderly, Harbin.

741
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,592
- So would I.
- Well, bring him in.

742
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:43,221
I can't.
He disappeared a week ago.

743
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:46,025
This is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters.

744
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:48,859
We have better witnesses.
Look here.

745
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:19,067
How could he have done it?

746
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:21,123
Seventy pounds a tube.

747
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:24,429
Go back to the hotel,
and do keep out of trouble.

748
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:28,093
I'll try and fix things with the Austrian
police. You'll be all right in the hotel,

749
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:30,362
but I can't be responsible
for you on the streets.

750
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:33,697
- I'm not asking you to.
- I'm sorry, Martins.

751
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,735
I'm sorry too.

752
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:40,698
You still got that
airplane ticket on you?

753
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,363
We'll send one across
to your hotel in the morning.

754
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,631
Thank you.
Excuse me.

755
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,364
Get me Austrian Police Headquarters.

756
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:50,529
Can I have that woman's passport?

757
00:58:50,605 --> 00:58:53,298
You know,
the Anna Schmidt one.

758
00:58:53,372 --> 00:58:56,634
Oh... we're not going to pick
her up for that, are we?

759
00:58:56,706 --> 00:59:00,399
What can we do?
We have our instructions.

760
00:59:46,244 --> 00:59:48,802
It's me.

761
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:54,477
It's me.

762
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,445
Hello.

763
01:00:01,512 --> 01:00:03,571
What is it?
What's happened to you?

764
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:07,203
Just came to see you.

765
01:00:07,279 --> 01:00:11,372
Come in. I thought you were going to
keep away. Are the police after you?

766
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:13,379
I don't know.

767
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:18,747
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- A bit. I'm sorry.

768
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:24,715
But I did want to say good-bye
before I pushed off.

769
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:27,045
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

770
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:32,273
It's what you've always wanted-
all of you.

771
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,611
Kitty? Here, kitty.

772
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:38,478
Kitty? Here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

773
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:42,038
Don't you want to play, kitty?
Come on. Sleepy? Sleepy kitty?

774
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:47,638
- Not very sociable, is he?
- No, he only liked Harry.

775
01:00:49,184 --> 01:00:52,117
- What made you decide so suddenly?
- I, I brought you these.

776
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,413
They, they got a little wet.

777
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:58,441
- What happened to your hand?
- A parrot-

778
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,281
- Let it go.
- Have you seen Calloway?

779
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:05,581
- Imagine a parrot nipping a man?
- Have you?

780
01:01:05,654 --> 01:01:09,982
It's-
Oh, I, I-

781
01:01:10,053 --> 01:01:13,315
I've been saying good-bye
all over, you know.

782
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:17,911
- He told you, didn't he?
- Told me?

783
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:21,818
- About Harry.
- Do you know?

784
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:26,218
I've seen Major Calloway today.

785
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:11,259
He is better dead.

786
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,293
I knew he was mixed-up,
but not like that.

787
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,317
I knew him for 20 years-
at least, I thought I knew him.

788
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,883
Suppose he was laughing
at fools like us all the time?

789
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,655
- He liked to laugh.
- Seventy pounds a tube.

790
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:29,889
He wanted me to write
for his great medical charity.

791
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:32,155
I'll put these flowers
in the water.

792
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:35,957
Perhaps I could have raised
the price to 80 pounds for him.

793
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:39,655
Oh, please. For heaven's sake,
stop making him in your image.

794
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:43,390
Harry was real. He wasn't
just your friend and my lover.

795
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:47,295
- He was Harry.
- Well, don't preach wisdom to me.

796
01:02:47,365 --> 01:02:52,889
You talk about him as if
he had occasional bad manners.

797
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:57,489
No. I don't know. I'm just
a hack writer who drinks too much...

798
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,656
and falls in love with girls.

799
01:03:02,498 --> 01:03:06,058
- You.
- Me?

800
01:03:06,134 --> 01:03:08,258
Don't be such a fool.
Of course.

801
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:13,230
If you'd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark...

802
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:16,392
or had a moustache,
I wouldn't have known.

803
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:18,400
Oh, I am leaving Vienna.

804
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:22,128
I don't care whether Henry
was murdered by Kurtz or Popescu...

805
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:24,633
or the third man or-

806
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:30,101
Whoever killed him, there was
some sort of... justice.

807
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,465
Maybe I would've
killed him myself.

808
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:34,968
A person doesn't change
because you find out more.

809
01:03:35,037 --> 01:03:40,402
Look. I've got a splitting headache, and you
stand there and just talk and talk and talk.

810
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:43,129
I- I hate it.

811
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:47,227
That's the first time
I ever saw you laugh.

812
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:49,236
Do it again.

813
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:56,103
There isn't enough for two laughs.

814
01:04:05,606 --> 01:04:09,539
I'd make comic faces...

815
01:04:09,606 --> 01:04:13,266
and stand on my head and grin
at you between my legs...

816
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,035
and tell all sorts of jokes.

817
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:22,907
I wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

818
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:35,942
Well...

819
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:42,104
you did tell me I ought
to find myself a girl.

820
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:15,412
What kind of a spy
do you think you are, satchel foot?

821
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,906
What are you tailing me for?

822
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:24,147
Cat got your tongue?

823
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,615
Come on out.

824
01:05:28,682 --> 01:05:31,978
Come out, come out,
whoever you are.

825
01:05:34,116 --> 01:05:36,912
Step out in the light
and let's have a look at ya.

826
01:05:36,982 --> 01:05:40,178
- Who's your boss?

827
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,110
Harry.

828
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:23,915
Harry!

829
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,252
I followed his shadow...

830
01:07:13,327 --> 01:07:15,260
until, suddenly-

831
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:18,316
- Well?
- This is where he vanished.

832
01:07:18,394 --> 01:07:21,624
- I see.
- I suppose you don't believe me.

833
01:07:21,695 --> 01:07:24,025
- No.
- Look. I tell you-

834
01:07:24,094 --> 01:07:26,323
- You don't think I'm blind, do you?
- Yes.

835
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:29,295
- Where were you when you saw him first?
- Fifty yards right down there.

836
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:32,328
- Which side of the road?
- I was on that side. His shadow was on that side.

837
01:07:32,397 --> 01:07:35,023
- And there are no turnings on either side.
- What about the doorways?

838
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:37,357
- I tell you, I heard him running ahead of me!
- Yes, yes, yes.

839
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,989
And then he vanished out there, I suppose,
with a puff of smoke and like a clap of-

840
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,597
It wasn't the German gin.

841
01:08:29,802 --> 01:08:32,769
Well, what's this?
Where are we?

842
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:35,769
It's the main sewer.

843
01:08:35,837 --> 01:08:39,668
Runs right into the blue Danube.
Smells sweet, doesn't it?

844
01:08:43,003 --> 01:08:46,266
We should have dug deeper
than a grave.

845
01:09:33,944 --> 01:09:35,876
You knew him, Major?

846
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:39,433
Hmm. Yes.

847
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:41,534
Yes. Joseph Harbin.

848
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,168
Medical orderly
at the General Hospital.

849
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:49,176
- He used to work for Harry Lime.
- Joseph Harbin?

850
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:54,008
Yes. He's the man
I told you was missing.

851
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:57,967
Next time we'll have
a foolproof coffin.

852
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,812
- Fraulein Schmidt?
- Ja.

853
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:11,551
- Where are you taking me?
- International Police Headquarters, just to check up.

854
01:12:19,561 --> 01:12:22,995
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

855
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:26,028
- I don't even know what protocol means.
- Neither do I, miss.

856
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:29,187
Mademoiselle,
your lipstick.

857
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,194
Thank you.

858
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,422
- Anna, what's happened to you?
- All right. Keep out of this.

859
01:12:46,498 --> 01:12:49,294
Listen, I've got to talk to you.
I've just seen a dead man walking.

860
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,956
- All right, chum. Get back.
- I saw him buried.

861
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:55,828
But now I've seen him alive.

862
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,931
Just a minute.
Bring her in here.

863
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:11,795
You stay out here.

864
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:16,131
Come in, Miss Schmidt.
Now then, Miss Schmidt.

865
01:13:16,202 --> 01:13:19,633
I'm not interested in your forged
papers. That's purely a Russian case.

866
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:23,135
- When did you last see Lime?
- Two weeks ago.

867
01:13:23,202 --> 01:13:26,497
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

868
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,797
- It is true, then.
- Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.

869
01:13:32,303 --> 01:13:34,236
What did you say?
I'm sorry.

870
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:37,791
I said another man
was buried in his place.

871
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,802
Where's Harry?

872
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,496
That's what we want
to find out.

873
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:47,835
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I-

874
01:13:48,906 --> 01:13:50,837
He is alive.

875
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:52,996
Now this minute,
he is doing something.

876
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:57,095
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

877
01:13:57,172 --> 01:13:59,435
You may as well help us.
In a few minutes,

878
01:13:59,507 --> 01:14:01,973
Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you
about your papers.

879
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,597
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

880
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:09,037
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

881
01:14:09,107 --> 01:14:12,595
Martins always said
you were a fool.

882
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:16,233
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

883
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:18,240
Poor Harry.

884
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:21,806
I wish he was dead.

885
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,374
He would be safe
from all of you, then.

886
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:38,340
Why, that's you!
Come up.

887
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:41,241
Winkel, look who is here.

888
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,242
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

889
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:45,833
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

890
01:14:45,912 --> 01:14:49,366
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

891
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:52,670
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

892
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:56,372
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

893
01:14:57,813 --> 01:15:00,074
Be reasonable.
Come up and talk.

894
01:15:00,146 --> 01:15:03,772
No, thank you.
I like the open.

895
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:07,746
Tell him I'll wait
by that wheel there.

896
01:15:07,814 --> 01:15:10,747
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr. Winkel?

897
01:15:12,348 --> 01:15:15,143
You got an opinion on that?

898
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:21,111
- Hello, old man. How are you?
- Hello, Harry.

899
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,848
Well, well, they seem to be
giving you quite some busy time.

900
01:16:23,923 --> 01:16:26,253
- Well, listen. I want to talk to you.
- Hmm, yes?

901
01:16:26,323 --> 01:16:29,880
Talk to me?
Well, of course. Come on.

902
01:16:32,724 --> 01:16:35,053
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

903
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:39,352
- But they haven't
the money now, poor devils.

904
01:16:39,424 --> 01:16:42,356
Listen, Harry.
I didn't believe that-

905
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:45,049
- It's good to see you, Holly.
- I was at your funeral.

906
01:16:45,124 --> 01:16:47,590
That was pretty smart,
wasn't it?

907
01:16:47,657 --> 01:16:49,817
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

908
01:16:49,892 --> 01:16:52,051
These are the only things
that help, these tablets.

909
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:54,853
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe anymore.

910
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:57,358
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

911
01:16:57,426 --> 01:17:00,153
- She's been arrested.
- Tough, very tough, but don't worry, old man.

912
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:02,886
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

913
01:17:02,961 --> 01:17:05,187
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

914
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:07,193
- You can help some.
- Holly,

915
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,022
exactly who did you tell
about me, hmm?

916
01:17:10,094 --> 01:17:13,060
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

917
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,321
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

918
01:17:15,396 --> 01:17:18,122
Did the, uh,
police believe you?

919
01:17:18,196 --> 01:17:20,161
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

920
01:17:20,228 --> 01:17:22,162
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

921
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:24,695
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do? Be reasonable.

922
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:27,456
- You can get somebody else-
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

923
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:29,963
- Why not?
- It's a far better thing that I do...

924
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,961
with the old limelight
than follow the curtain-

925
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:35,326
No. You and I aren't heroes.
The world doesn't make any heroes-

926
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:37,828
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- Outside of your stories.

927
01:17:37,898 --> 01:17:39,864
I've got to be so careful.

928
01:17:39,931 --> 01:17:43,329
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm
only safe as long as they can use me.

929
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:46,523
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

930
01:17:46,597 --> 01:17:50,088
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

931
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,132
Don't try to be a policeman,
old man.

932
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:54,630
- What do you expect me to
be? Part of your- - Part?

933
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:58,461
You can have any part as long as you don't
interfere. I've never cut you out of anything.

934
01:17:58,533 --> 01:18:02,194
Yes, I remember when they raided the
gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.

935
01:18:02,267 --> 01:18:05,200
- Sure!
- Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

936
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:09,928
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

937
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:12,967
You ought to leave
this thing alone.

938
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:15,865
Have you ever seen
any of your victims?

939
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:19,333
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

940
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:21,926
Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

941
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:25,927
Tell me.

942
01:18:26,003 --> 01:18:30,834
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

943
01:18:30,904 --> 01:18:34,098
If I offered you 20,000
for every dot that stopped,

944
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,601
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

945
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:40,694
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

946
01:18:40,771 --> 01:18:43,703
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax-

947
01:18:43,772 --> 01:18:46,498
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

948
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:50,026
- A lot of good your money will do you in jail.
- That jail's in another zone.

949
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,033
There's no proof against me,

950
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:56,039
besides you.

951
01:19:03,341 --> 01:19:05,499
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

952
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,772
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

953
01:19:10,842 --> 01:19:13,706
I carry a gun.

954
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:17,230
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

955
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:22,101
They dug up your coffin.

956
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,841
And found Harbin?

957
01:19:32,443 --> 01:19:34,375
Mm-hmm.

958
01:19:36,511 --> 01:19:38,568
Pity.

959
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:42,168
Holly, what fools we are
talking to each other this way,

960
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,005
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

961
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:47,872
You're just a little mixed-up
about things in general.

962
01:19:47,944 --> 01:19:51,708
Nobody thinks in terms
of human beings.

963
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,710
Governments don't.
Why should we?

964
01:19:53,778 --> 01:19:57,440
They talk about the people and the proletariat.
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

965
01:19:57,512 --> 01:20:03,377
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

966
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:06,141
You used to believe in God.

967
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:08,976
I still do believe in God,
old man.

968
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,809
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

969
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,245
But the dead are happier dead.

970
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:19,407
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

971
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:25,049
What do you believe in?

972
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:28,549
Oh, if we ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

973
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,606
I think you'll find
she's worth it.

974
01:20:30,683 --> 01:20:33,774
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

975
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:37,614
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

976
01:20:37,685 --> 01:20:41,741
There's nobody left in Vienna I can really
trust, and we've always done everything together.

977
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:45,215
When you make up your mind, send me a
message. I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

978
01:20:45,286 --> 01:20:48,252
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see,

979
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:50,478
not the police.

980
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:52,484
Remember that, won't you?

981
01:20:52,552 --> 01:20:56,112
And don't be so gloomy!
After all, it's not that awful.

982
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:58,652
Remember what the fella said:

983
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,380
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias,
they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed.

984
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:07,079
But they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

985
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:09,552
In Switzerland,
they had brotherly love.

986
01:21:09,622 --> 01:21:14,144
They had 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce?

987
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:17,017
The cuckoo clock.
So long, Holly.

988
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,017
But look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at,

989
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:30,817
at some little cafe here
in the international zone.

990
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:32,823
- It would never work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

991
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:35,686
Calloway, you expect too much.

992
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:38,724
Oh, I know he deserves to hang.
You've proved your stuff,

993
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:42,245
but 20 years is a long time.

994
01:21:42,324 --> 01:21:44,951
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

995
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,288
Okay. Forget it.

996
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,518
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

997
01:21:50,593 --> 01:21:53,990
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

998
01:21:55,593 --> 01:21:57,786
I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

999
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:01,315
We shall apply for her at
the Four Power meeting tomorrow.

1000
01:22:01,393 --> 01:22:04,020
She has no right to be here.

1001
01:22:05,594 --> 01:22:08,458
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1002
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:12,222
That's a different case.
It is being looked into.

1003
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:14,693
- So long, Major.

1004
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:19,922
In the last war, a general would hang
his opponent's picture on the wall.

1005
01:22:19,996 --> 01:22:22,119
He got to know him that way.

1006
01:22:22,195 --> 01:22:25,094
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1007
01:22:25,162 --> 01:22:29,255
I think this would've worked,
with your help.

1008
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,597
What price would you pay?

1009
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:46,721
Name it.

1010
01:23:14,835 --> 01:23:17,495
Here we are.
You'll be all right here, miss.

1011
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:23,592
I don't understand
Major Calloway. I-

1012
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:27,569
- I expect he's got a soft spot for you, miss.
- Why has he done all this?

1013
01:23:27,636 --> 01:23:31,592
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

1014
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,659
There we are, miss.

1015
01:23:33,737 --> 01:23:37,227
- Thank you. You've been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

1016
01:23:39,438 --> 01:23:41,960
- Good night, miss.
- Good-bye.

1017
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:23,901
- Are you going too?
- Oh.

1018
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:27,272
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you off.

1019
01:24:27,343 --> 01:24:29,105
See me off?
From here?

1020
01:24:29,176 --> 01:24:33,872
Oh, I watched you onto the train, uh-
No harm in that, is there?

1021
01:24:33,945 --> 01:24:36,375
How did you know
I'd be here?

1022
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:40,206
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

1023
01:24:40,278 --> 01:24:42,767
Have you been seeing
Major Calloway again?

1024
01:24:42,843 --> 01:24:45,640
Of course not.
I don't live in his pocket.

1025
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:48,944
Harry, what is it?

1026
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:53,402
- For heaven sakes, stop calling me Harry.
- I'm sorry.

1027
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:55,569
- Let's go.

1028
01:24:55,645 --> 01:24:57,669
What's on your mind?
Why did you hide here?

1029
01:24:57,746 --> 01:25:01,371
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here. It'll be cold on that train.

1030
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:04,005
- I shall be all right.
- You send me a wire as soon as you are.

1031
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,876
- What's going to happen? Where is Harry?
- He's safe in the Russian zone.

1032
01:25:06,947 --> 01:25:09,243
- How do you know?
- Well, I saw him today.

1033
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:11,746
- How is he?
- He can look after himself. Don't worry.

1034
01:25:11,814 --> 01:25:14,712
- Did he say anything about me? Tell me!
- Oh, the usual things.

1035
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:17,839
- Is something wrong? Did you tell Calloway about Harry?
- Of course I didn't.

1036
01:25:17,915 --> 01:25:20,643
Why should he help me?
The Russians will make trouble for him.

1037
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,579
- That's his headache. Oh, Anna!
- His? Why are you lying?

1038
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,308
- We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
- I'm not going.

1039
01:25:26,383 --> 01:25:28,575
You'd-

1040
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:32,138
Anna, don't you recognize
a good turn when you see one?

1041
01:25:32,217 --> 01:25:34,775
You have seen Calloway?
What are you two doing?

1042
01:25:36,816 --> 01:25:40,773
Well, they, they asked me
to help take him.

1043
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,783
I'm helping.

1044
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,147
- Poor Harry.
- Poor Harry.

1045
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,416
Poor Harry... wouldn't even
lift a finger to help you.

1046
01:26:01,487 --> 01:26:05,420
Oh, you've got your precious honesty
and don't want anything else.

1047
01:26:05,488 --> 01:26:07,454
You still want him.

1048
01:26:07,522 --> 01:26:09,680
I don't want him anymore.

1049
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:14,709
I don't want to see him, hear him, but
he's still a part of me. That's a fact.

1050
01:26:14,788 --> 01:26:17,119
I couldn't do a thing
to harm him.

1051
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:41,290
Oh, Anna, why do we always
have to quarrel?

1052
01:26:41,358 --> 01:26:45,724
If you want to sell your services,
I'm not willing to be the price.

1053
01:26:48,426 --> 01:26:51,586
I loved him.
You loved him.

1054
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:54,854
What good have we done him...
for love?

1055
01:26:56,727 --> 01:26:58,717
Look at yourself.

1056
01:26:58,793 --> 01:27:02,124
They have a name
for faces like that.

1057
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,787
- Calloway.
- Come in here. There isn't much time.

1058
01:27:25,863 --> 01:27:29,124
I want to get a plane
out of here tonight.

1059
01:27:29,196 --> 01:27:31,959
- So she talked you out of it.
- Gave me these.

1060
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:35,385
A girl of spirit.

1061
01:27:35,464 --> 01:27:39,521
She's right.
It is none of my business.

1062
01:27:39,598 --> 01:27:43,793
It won't make any difference
in the long run. I'll get him.

1063
01:27:43,865 --> 01:27:48,298
- Well, I won't have helped.
- That'll be a fine boast to make.

1064
01:27:48,365 --> 01:27:51,492
- Well, I always wanted you to catch that plane, didn't I?
- You all did.

1065
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:56,295
I'd better see if there's anyone still
at the terminus. You may need a priority.

1066
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:00,462
Mind if I drop off
somewhere on the way?

1067
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:03,432
- I've got an appointment. It won't take five minutes.
- Of course.

1068
01:28:03,499 --> 01:28:06,591
Why don't you come in too?
You're a writer. It might interest you.

1069
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:10,800
This is the biggest children's
hospital in Vienna.

1070
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:14,061
All the kids in here are the result
of Lime's penicillin racket.

1071
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:39,001
He'd had meningitis.
They gave it some of Lime's penicillin.

1072
01:28:40,038 --> 01:28:41,969
Terrible pity, isn't it?

1073
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:12,999
Paine lent me one of your books.
Oklahoma Kid, I think it was.

1074
01:29:13,076 --> 01:29:15,667
I read a bit of it. Looks as if
it's gonna be pretty good.

1075
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:20,176
What made you take up this sort
of thing? Been doing it for long?

1076
01:29:20,243 --> 01:29:23,504
- All right, Calloway. You win.
- I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas.

1077
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:26,565
- I said you win.
- Win what?

1078
01:29:26,644 --> 01:29:31,234
I'll be your...
dumb decoy duck.

1079
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:26,516
Psst!

1080
01:30:36,017 --> 01:30:37,950
Paine.

1081
01:31:03,754 --> 01:31:05,686
Look, sir!

1082
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:14,353
How much longer
are you going to sit here?

1083
01:31:14,422 --> 01:31:16,444
Shall I go over there, sir?

1084
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:19,455
No. No,
leave them for a while.

1085
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:41,582
Mein Herr, Ballon?

1086
01:31:41,658 --> 01:31:44,146
Nein, danke. Nein.

1087
01:31:46,993 --> 01:31:49,254
- Ballon?

1088
01:31:49,325 --> 01:31:53,349
Go on. Hop it, scarper.

1089
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:57,189
- Ballon, mein Herr?

1090
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,592
All right, all right.
Only one. Go on, scarper.

1091
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:47,996
You should have gone.
How did you know I was here, anyway?

1092
01:32:48,065 --> 01:32:51,555
From Kurtz.
They have just been arrested.

1093
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:54,531
But Harry won't come.
He's not a fool.

1094
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:58,794
- Yes, Paine. Slip over there. See what she's up to.
- Right, sir.

1095
01:32:58,866 --> 01:33:02,163
Don't tell me you are doing
all this for nothing.

1096
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:06,366
- What's your price this time?
- No price, Anna.

1097
01:33:06,435 --> 01:33:09,229
Honest, sensible, sober,

1098
01:33:09,302 --> 01:33:11,632
harmless Holly Martins.

1099
01:33:11,702 --> 01:33:14,861
Holly.
What a silly name.

1100
01:33:14,936 --> 01:33:19,630
You must feel very proud
to be a police informer.

1101
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:24,933
Harry, get away!
The police are outside!

1102
01:33:25,004 --> 01:33:26,368
- Quick!
- Anna.

1103
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:34,169
Sir, the back!

1104
01:34:35,077 --> 01:34:37,010
All right.

1105
01:34:46,413 --> 01:34:48,345
Martins, get back!

1106
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:05,296
Harry!

1107
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:07,204
- Is that you?
- You're through.

1108
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:09,367
Come out. You haven't
got a chance this way.

1109
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:12,533
- What do you want?
- You might as well give up.

1110
01:39:12,609 --> 01:39:15,576
Mr. Martins, sir,
get back, get back!

1111
01:39:15,643 --> 01:39:18,802
Keep back, sir!
Come back! Come back, sir!

1112
01:40:54,253 --> 01:40:56,380
Martins! Martins!

1113
01:40:56,454 --> 01:40:59,216
Be careful, Martins.

1114
01:40:59,288 --> 01:41:03,583
Don't take any chances.
If you see him, shoot!

1115
01:42:04,095 --> 01:42:06,084
What time is it?

1116
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,651
- 2:30.

1117
01:42:12,295 --> 01:42:15,558
I'll have to step on it
if you're going to catch that plane.

1118
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:19,721
Calloway, can't you
do something about Anna?

1119
01:42:19,797 --> 01:42:23,252
I'll do what I can,
if she'll let me.

1120
01:42:33,498 --> 01:42:37,362
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- Well, there's not much time.

1121
01:42:37,433 --> 01:42:41,364
One can't just leave.
Please.

1122
01:42:42,466 --> 01:42:44,829
Be sensible, Martins.

1123
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:47,525
I haven't got a sensible name,
Calloway.
