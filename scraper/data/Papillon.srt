1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
All present and accounted for, sir.

2
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Thank you, Captain.

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
As of this moment...

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,080
...you are the property of
the Penal Administration of French Guiana.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,370
After serving your full terms in prison...

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,700
...those of you with sentences...

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,180
...of eight years or more...

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
...will remain in Guiana...

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,450
...as workers and colonists...

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,460
...for a period equal
to that of your original sentences.

11
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,900
As for France...

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,990
...the nation has disposed of you.

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,785
France has rid herself of you altogether.

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,300
Forget France and put your clothes on.

15
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Papillon. Papi.

16
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
You'll be back, Papillon.

17
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,680
Don't worry, you'll be back.

18
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
No, you won't.

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,700
You, that way.

20
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Down there. You, too.

21
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,980
Next, over here. Come along.

22
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Come on. Come in here.

23
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
You, too.

24
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
Over there.

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,635
Come along, up there. Hurry up.

26
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,700
You, too. Down.

27
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Down. In there.

28
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
In there.

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come along, now. Down.

30
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,425
Come on down. Down there.

31
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Come on, up there.

32
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
In there.

33
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
We're really something, aren't we?

34
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,700
The only animals in the world
that shove things up their ass for survival.

35
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,100
The first time I shoved one up my gut...

36
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
...it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out.

37
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,680
He doesn't have any ether...

38
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,420
...so he knocks me out with rum.

39
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Then you know what he did?

40
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
He stole it.

41
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
A butterfly.

42
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
You're Papillon, aren't you?

43
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
Yeah.

44
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,795
The bastards gave you life.

45
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,100
Right to the end of the line, they think.

46
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
It may not be as long as you think.

47
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
Forty percent of us will die...

48
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
...the first year out.

49
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,440
They gave him life, too.

50
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
The kid's only 18.

51
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,705
Look at him. No wonder he dreams.

52
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
He'll never make it.

53
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
But a man like you could make it...

54
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,700
...if you have enough money.

55
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,840
How long were you there?

56
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,110
Nine years of work camp...

57
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,600
...nine years a colonist.

58
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,200
You were outside the walls.
Why didn't you run?

59
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
There's no place to run to.

60
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
You're out in the middle of a swamp,
1,000 miles from no place.

61
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Now, if you've got a lot of money
that's a different thing.

62
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,905
I mean, you take somebody
like Dega there. Back there.

63
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,540
Louis Dega.
The best counterfeiter in France.

64
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
National Defense Bonds.

65
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
Series of 1928.
- Right.

66
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Now, if you've got money like he has,
there's a chance to buy your way out.

67
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,020
That is unless somebody cuts
his guts open first to get at all that cash.

68
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Everybody up. Let's go.

69
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Everybody up.

70
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,800
Come on, everybody up. Let's go.

71
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Let's go.

72
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,840
Mind if I sit down here?

73
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
If you wish.

74
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,675
You're Dega, aren't ya? Louis Dega?

75
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,300
Sorry to see you here.

76
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,140
I presume most of us have earned
our passage.

77
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,900
You're Papillon. You got life for killing
a pimp. Then you had the bad taste...

78
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,900
...to tell the prosecutor you were going
to escape and kill him, too.

79
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,700
I was framed. I'm innocent.

80
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,500
No one is innocent.

81
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,700
I'm no pimp killer, for Christ's sake.

82
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm a safecracker.

83
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,400
And that's a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

84
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,345
I put almost everything I had
into National Defense Bonds.

85
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Series of 1928.

86
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
1928?

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Your instincts were sound.
How much did you lose?

88
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,500
I wouldn't put my money on those bonds.
Not any more than you would.

89
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

90
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,350
If that's true,
why are we having this little chat?

91
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Every convict on this ship knows
who you are.

92
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Any of them would slit you open to
reach inside and get what you're carrying.

93
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
So?

94
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
You need protection.

95
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
From you?

96
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,500
Remember what the chicken said
to the weasel?

97
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
If he was a healthy weasel, the chicken
didn't get a chance to say anything.

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Think about that.

99
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
Hose down.

100
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,775
Come on, off your asses. Hose down.

101
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,500
Come on, you've got a fever.

102
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Do what I tell ya.

103
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,700
Come on.

104
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Julot.

105
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I've got a question.

106
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,800
If I wanted to get a boat when I got there,
a small boat, maybe a 15-footer...

107
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,800
...how much would it cost?

108
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,400
I don't know. Fr 3,500, Fr 4,500, maybe.
It all depends.

109
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,800
What if I could pick up the money
to buy one?

110
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,700
Then I guess you'd have yourself a boat.

111
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,900
You know the country.
You and I could make it out of there. Huh?

112
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The answer is no. Nothing against you,
but the answer is no.

113
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,400
If I've gotta go to solitary for
some half-assed escape that didn't work...

114
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,900
...l want the mistake to be mine,
not anybody else's. You understand?

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So the answer is no.

116
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,700
How'd it feel, kid?

117
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Good.

118
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,480
All right. Come on, move it.

119
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Move it a little. Let's go.

120
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Let's move.

121
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
What do you want?

122
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,880
Almost unbearable, isn't it?

123
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
What?

124
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,900
The heat.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not too bad.

126
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,400
Of course, you're closer to it than I am.

127
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,835
Oh, yes. You're referring to last night,
aren't you?

128
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,100
Well, aren't you?

129
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
May I tell you something?

130
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,500
At first glance I'm afraid
that I regarded you with rather...

131
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,000
...a large degree of unworthy suspicion.

132
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Am I clear?

133
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,600
No.

134
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,200
Well, it now seems quite possible
that until we get to a decent jail...

135
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,975
...with bribeable guards,
I may stand in some need of...

136
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,960
...rather close physical protection.

137
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,800
It depends on how long you want to live.

138
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Oh, a long time.

139
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Then you got a problem.

140
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,945
Well, I presume that you have some...

141
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,600
...goals, some particular need that...

142
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,740
...outweighs all others.

143
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,400
I mean, if so, may I ask what it is?

144
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Money.

145
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,000
For what?

146
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Escape.

147
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Very good.

148
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
You keep me alive...

149
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,400
...until we land in Guiana and I will
underwrite any escape you care to arrange.

150
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,800
Escape for me. Not for us.

151
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Of course.

152
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,890
I have no intention of even attempting
an escape. Ever.

153
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Done.

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Thank you.

155
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Leave him alone...

156
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,765
...or I'll cut your head off.

157
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Hide this.

158
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,395
Over there is Saint Joseph.

159
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,300
The other island is Royale.

160
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,600
The one on the right is Devil's.

161
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,525
Julot, why is it so hard
to escape from there?

162
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,300
A man could almost swim to the mainland.

163
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,700
No, there must be a better way
than swimming.

164
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,600
No, no, swimming's not the way.

165
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,000
The current is so strong it'll push you
right back where you started from.

166
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,285
You know, when you're on those islands
you're there for keeps.

167
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Where do we go?

168
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,310
We go up the Moroni River.

169
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
Then we dock at Saint Laurent.

170
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,500
That's where they decide whether
to send you to the work camps or...

171
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
...to the islands.

172
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,400
You see those two on the dock
with the guns?

173
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Right over there.

174
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,000
They served their time.
Now they're colonists.

175
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
They've turned man hunter.

176
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,400
Man hunter?

177
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,600
Yeah, you escape, they hunt.

178
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,200
For money, I presume, a reward.

179
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
Jesus.

180
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
Get ready to move.

181
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Line up to disembark.

182
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm going to have an accident going down
that gangplank and it's gotta look good...

183
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,900
...so lend me your shiv.

184
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,500
What the hell for?

185
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Because I'm a two-time loser.

186
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,300
No matter what happens, I'll be sent
to the islands on the next transport.

187
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
I have to get in the hospital
to give me time to think.

188
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Now give me that shiv.

189
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
You're crazy, Julot.

190
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,830
Single file down the gangplank. March.

191
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Hold it. Hold it.

192
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Let's go.

193
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Single file.

194
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Move. Let's go.

195
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Bring a stretcher.

196
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,025
Single file, single file.

197
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Take him away.

198
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,800
All right, move. Move.
- Let's go.

199
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Move it.

200
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,800
Come on, move 'em.

201
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Let's go. Come on.

202
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Column, march.

203
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Keep moving.

204
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,950
You two, pick him up, quickly.

205
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Attention.

206
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,350
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

207
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
...of French Guiana...

208
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,900
...whose prisoners you are...

209
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,145
...and from which there is no escape.

210
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,595
First attempts at escape...

211
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,950
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

212
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,735
Second attempts, add five more.

213
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,075
Of course, more serious offenses...

214
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,200
...are dealt with in this fashion.

215
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Make the best of what we offer you
and you will suffer less than you deserve.

216
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Dismissed.

217
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,800
In the bunkhouse.

218
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,600
One, two, three, four.

219
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,400
Go on. Go on. Get a move on.

220
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
Mr. Dega?

221
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,300
Yes, indeed.
I know all about you, Mr. Dega.

222
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Very intelligent man.

223
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,300
Thank you. I seem to be known
in all the wrong places.

224
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,395
Well, I have a friend who is a guard.
For very--

225
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Yes, go ahead.

226
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,200
For very little money he can arrange
for certain people to stay here...

227
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,400
...instead of being sent to a work camp
or one of the islands.

228
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,400
Can he get us a job here
so we can walk around the place?

229
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
Perhaps a selection from which
we may choose?

230
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,020
Oh, yes. That is, my friend can.

231
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,900
You take our money,
and you put your life on the line.

232
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Of course.

233
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
How much will it cost?

234
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,600
Well, my friend has a very large family.
Many little children, you understand?

235
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,500
And his sergeant has a mother,
heart trouble.

236
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
He was asking you how much,
not how many.

237
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,555
If you don't mind, I'll do the negotiating.

238
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,600
How much?

239
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,300
For you, Fr 500. For him, Fr 1,500.

240
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
He made trouble.

241
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,800
Yes, indeed he did. Nevertheless,
I'll give you Fr 1,250 for the both of us.

242
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,385
Now, you take it or leave it as you wish.

243
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Try again.

244
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,900
Very well. I want two pairs
of comfortable shoes for the both of us...

245
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,805
...and you, you get the Fr 2,000.

246
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,300
Don't you have to go to the toilet?

247
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you excuse me a moment?

248
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,600
You don't need to, Mr. Dega.
Unless, of course, you want to.

249
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,420
I can pick it up in the morning.

250
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Get moving, white men.

251
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Let's go. Come on, move it.

252
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,900
Let's go. Come on, move it.

253
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
On your feet.

254
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,300
Attention. Present arms.

255
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
No. No.

256
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
No.

257
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,920
Mr. Dega, did you get the money?

258
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,400
Move it. Move it. Move it.

259
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Get going. Move it.

260
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,200
Fischer, what the hell's wrong?

261
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,870
Someone broke out
of the hospital compound.

262
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,430
All right, break it up. We'll get him.

263
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Next.

264
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Next.

265
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,300
You're fine. Next.

266
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,865
I must be better than I feel.

267
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,810
You're in wonderful shape.

268
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,900
How do you fail an examination like this?

269
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Next.

270
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
7551.

271
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,100
Dega?

272
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Yes, sir, Louis Dega.

273
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
It was suggested that I speak to you, sir--

274
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,400
I have it right here.

275
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,700
We'll just keep you on here
in the cleaning squad.

276
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Thank you, sir. There's also my friend.

277
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,000
You're Louis Dega?

278
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,700
I am, sir. And this is my friend, Papillon.

279
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,600
We have a great deal in common,
Mr. Dega.

280
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm extremely glad to see you.

281
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,300
Why, thank you, sir.
Of course, if the circumstances were--

282
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,520
My family lost everything they had
in counterfeit National Defense Bonds.

283
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,700
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

284
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,300
Even so, buying them was a tribute
to their patriotism, wouldn't you say?

285
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,700
And you're Mr. Dega's friend?

286
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,600
Well--

287
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,900
There's one thing about Saint Laurent
you'll like:

288
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,550
We never separate old friends.

289
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,485
Kilo 40. Both of them. Today's transport.

290
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
What is Kilo 40?

291
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,400
Don't touch him.
You'll wind up worse off than he is.

292
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Move. Get moving.

293
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Duck.

294
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,210
Get up, you lazy bastards.

295
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
You get that crock
and you bring him along.

296
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,970
You. Pick another man and grab that crock.

297
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Come on, move.

298
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Move.

299
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,500
The son of a bitch isn't dead,
they just irritated him.

300
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,235
Get his tail. You get his tail.

301
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,265
Where's his tail?
- Over there.

302
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,600
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

303
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,200
So am l.
- Go ahead.

304
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Okay.

305
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Ready?

306
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Is that the tail?
- No.

307
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,420
I'd better go over to this side.

308
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,800
You get the head.

309
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
The head?
- Yeah.

310
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
You try the tail.

311
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,495
Okay, now you try the head.

312
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Grab him.

313
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,400
He's dead.

314
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
He's still talking.

315
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
He's dead.

316
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
He's dead?

317
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Move it.

318
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Come on.

319
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
Come on, hands up.

320
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,200
Next.

321
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Move.

322
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,000
Next.

323
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,600
Bring it around here.

324
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,600
Just lay the crock right there.

325
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Just drop it.
- Hold it.

326
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Move out.

327
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,400
He's pretty big.

328
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,965
This skin's worth some money.

329
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Move it.

330
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,005
What the hell are you looking at?

331
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
You're Louis Dega.

332
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes, sir.

333
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm Clusiot.

334
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,070
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

335
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Favoritism.

336
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Friend's kind of quiet, isn't he?

337
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
He's dead.

338
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,665
He jammed a piece of wood down
his throat and choked himself to death.

339
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Three-way split....

340
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
It's fair, isn't it?

341
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,100
Quinine.

342
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,515
Worst country in the world for malaria.

343
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Here, take them.

344
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,265
Go ahead, I've got some left.

345
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,845
Well, if I'm going to get my sleep...

346
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,995
...I'll have to take this poor bastard with me.

347
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
A decent man.

348
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Dega....

349
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,000
The man hunters.
The ones we saw down at the dock.

350
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Son of a bitches.

351
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,620
Butterflies?
- Yeah, that's right.

352
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,200
Some guy named Richter.

353
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,500
He works every camp on the river
buying the damn things.

354
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,700
We catch them, he buys them,
the guards get the big payoff.

355
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,300
It's called the Blue Morphus butterfly.

356
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,075
It's wings are used for dye
in making American currency.

357
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,100
How often does he come up here?

358
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,600
A couple of times a month.

359
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,600
Boat?

360
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
No other way.

361
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Why?
- Thinking.

362
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,100
I handle a boat pretty good myself,
you know?

363
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Yeah?

364
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,665
You're supposed to catch them,
you clumsy bastard.

365
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,205
Where do you send these bugs, sir?
- The United States.

366
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,920
How much would you charge
to send this one to Panama?

367
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,410
Guard, come here a minute.

368
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,300
Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake.
I got Fr 1,000.

369
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,500
I didn't hear you.

370
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,700
I said I got Fr 2,000 on me.

371
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Right now.

372
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
What's the trouble?

373
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,700
This man just brought me
the finest Morphus...

374
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
...I've ever seen.

375
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,600
Why don't you get him a net?

376
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Right away, sir.

377
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,700
I want a seaworthy boat, new sails.

378
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,300
It'll cost you Fr 4,000, my friend.
Half now, half on delivery.

379
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,500
When will that be?

380
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,000
One week from tonight.

381
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,400
Where will the boat be?

382
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Half a mile down river.

383
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,900
About 300 yards this side of the river...

384
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
...there's a big tree.

385
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,000
You can't miss it.

386
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I'll be there.

387
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,300
You bring me the rest of the money.

388
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,695
I'll take you to your boat.

389
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,995
You're a goddamn burglar...

390
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
...and that proves it.

391
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Are you asleep?

392
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
No.

393
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I've been thinking....

394
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,240
When you decide to go...

395
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,855
...I'd very much appreciate going with you.

396
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
What?

397
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,810
Can you handle a boat?
- No.

398
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,450
Well, can you even see a boat
without your glasses?

399
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,700
I can help.

400
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,700
Jesus Christ. You're the one
that didn't want to risk it.

401
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I didn't.

402
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Now I have no choice.

403
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,900
If I stay here in this place...

404
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
...I'll die.

405
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Well, it's your money.

406
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
You two, I've got a job for you.

407
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,490
You load a stiff into the boat,
you load him right now.

408
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Julot.

409
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Pick him up.

410
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Dega.

411
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Don't puke here.

412
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Hey, Sarge.

413
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Sarge.

414
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
He didn't mean it, sir. He's sick.

415
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
I'll take care of him.

416
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
Stop that, you pig.

417
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,925
You just leave him to me.

418
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,695
I'll take care of him, sir.

419
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Stop, you bastard.

420
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,300
Do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone...

421
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,610
...used it as an ornament?

422
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,905
I've always admired him for that.

423
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,930
There's one search party that gave up.

424
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,300
Instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens...

425
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,375
...l made the lens fit the orifice.

426
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,210
What do you think?
Did he make it or didn't he?

427
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,200
I'd say his chances are very poor,
wouldn't you?

428
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,445
Jesus. Is that all you've got to say?

429
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,465
What do you expect me to say?

430
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,130
That man risked his life to save mine.

431
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,135
For me that's a new experience.

432
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,115
These may work better than I had hoped.

433
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,605
I told you, you couldn't miss it.

434
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,300
The only trouble is, you're a week early.

435
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
It's up to you.

436
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,295
You're worth just as much dead
as you are alive.

437
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,435
The rule here is total silence.

438
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,000
We make no pretense of rehabilitation here.

439
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,160
We're not priests, we're processors.

440
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,900
A meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones.

441
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,655
We process dangerous men
into harmless ones.

442
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,975
This we accomplish by breaking you.

443
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,910
Breaking you physically, spiritually,
and here.

444
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,300
Strange things happen to the head here.
Put all hope out of your mind...

445
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,100
...and masturbate as little as possible.
It drains the strength.

446
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,410
That's all, take him away.

447
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,300
One, two...

448
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,700
...three, four, five.

449
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,700
One, two, three, four, five.

450
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, Jesus.

451
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,800
No. You'll eat everything they give you.

452
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
I'm going to be fine.

453
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,700
I'm going to be fine.

454
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
I'm going to be fine.

455
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,100
One, two, three, four, five.

456
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,200
I'm Jo-Jo.

457
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,900
Papillon.

458
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,500
How do I look?

459
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,000
I feel pretty good...

460
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,140
...but I need somebody
to tell me how I look.

461
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Fine. You look fine.

462
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,525
'Chew the coconut well...

463
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,700
'...then swallow the pulp.

464
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,400
'One each day, for strength.

465
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,310
'My thoughts are with you.

466
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,300
'Squinter.'

467
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,300
Dega. I'll be a son of a bitch. Dega.

468
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,165
I'm still here, you bastards.

469
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,040
Prisoner, show yourself.

470
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,235
You've been receiving coconuts.

471
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:07,000
Unless you tell us who sent them,
your rations will be cut in half.

472
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,800
Well, how can I tell you...

473
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,800
...who sent me stuff I didn't get?

474
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
What stuff?

475
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,400
Well, I don't know.

476
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,000
You...

477
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,100
...you said coconut.

478
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,375
I want that name and I want it now.

479
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,330
Put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months.

480
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,115
Darkness does wonders for a bad memory.

481
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
You know the charge.

482
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,200
I'm innocent.

483
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,340
I didn't kill that pimp.

484
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,665
You couldn't get anything on me
and you framed me.

485
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
That is quite true.

486
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,845
But your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp's death.

487
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,700
Well then?

488
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,100
What is it?

489
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit.

490
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
I accuse you...

491
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
...of a wasted life.

492
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Guilty.

493
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,450
The penalty for that is death.

494
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Guilty.

495
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,900
Guilty.

496
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
Guilty.

497
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,300
They know.

498
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,200
How did you hear?

499
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,400
Trusty works on the launch
between here and Saint Joseph.

500
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,540
That's all that he said?

501
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Then it's only a matter of time.

502
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,400
You think so?

503
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,000
He's on half rations now.
He can't exist on that.

504
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,200
Forced to choose between starvation
and telling, what would you do?

505
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,000
We're not talking about me.
What would you do?

506
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,600
I'd tell. I'd have to.

507
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,435
You get weak, you get delirious,
you lose control...

508
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
...and you talk.

509
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,750
Then you won't blame him, huh?

510
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,060
Blame is for God and small children.

511
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,300
Look at me. I eat bugs.

512
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:29,130
I don't...l don't have enough sense
to get out of the rain.

513
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,940
Prisoner, show yourself.

514
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,680
Give me the name
and you're back on full rations.

515
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,700
Just one name.

516
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,650
Well, I don't get that hungry.

517
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,515
You'll starve. You should see yourself.

518
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I was born skinny.

519
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
Then you'll die.

520
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,400
One, two....

521
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,100
I'm Papillon.

522
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,300
Francisco.

523
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
How do I look?

524
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,700
Do I look okay?

525
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
You look swell.

526
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,200
That's 30 days more...

527
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,900
...pimp killer.

528
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,125
I want to see the warden.

529
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,300
I want to talk to him.

530
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,460
I have something I want to tell him.

531
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Who gave you the food?

532
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,100
I....

533
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,500
Jesus, Warden...

534
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
...l had it.

535
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,405
I had the name, honest to God....

536
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
I must be light--

537
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,995
I must be lightheaded or...

538
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
...something because...

539
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
...I'm trying.

540
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,100
I'm trying.

541
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,500
I can...l can't remember.

542
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,500
Honest to God, I can't.

543
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,810
I can't, I can't remember.

544
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,600
It's not there, Mr. Prosecutor.

545
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,215
I don't know, it's not, it's not there.

546
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,300
No.

547
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
It's gone.

548
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
He's dying.

549
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,200
You're dead.

550
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,200
Your term is completed.

551
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,200
One, two, three, four...

552
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,700
...five...

553
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
...six.

554
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,700
Oh, you son of a bitch.

555
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,550
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

556
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,600
...of French Guiana...

557
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,900
...whose prisoners you are...

558
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,145
...and from which there is no escape.

559
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,495
First attempts at escape...

560
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,850
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

561
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,035
Second attempts, add five more.

562
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,800
Of course, more serious offenses...

563
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,790
...are dealt with in this fashion.

564
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,400
Hello, Papi.

565
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,115
Don't take advantage. I'm in handcuffs.

566
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,945
Make the best of what we offer you...

567
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,500
...and you will suffer less than you deserve.

568
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,600
Dismissed.

569
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,900
Move. In the bunkhouse.

570
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,300
I have hot soup, with real meat in it.

571
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
Dega sent it to you.

572
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,900
My name is Maturette.

573
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,300
How are you?

574
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,300
Pretty good.

575
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,700
You'd be in much better health, you know,
if you'd given them my name.

576
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
I almost did.

577
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,240
Someone once said
that temptation resisted...

578
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,560
...is the true measure of character.

579
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,400
How'd you get out of Kilo 40?

580
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,100
It was the rankest sort of corruption.

581
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,000
Suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house...

582
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,075
...and I've become his chief clerk.

583
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,600
Papi, look....

584
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,400
My wife and lawyer...

585
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,700
...have convinced certain members
in the Ministry of Justice...

586
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,100
...that my sentence was a bit harsh.

587
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,600
Some months back I asked them...

588
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,080
...to look into your case...

589
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,500
...and they've made some headway.

590
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,400
One of the principle witnesses
against you...

591
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,900
...may be willing to change his story...

592
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,400
...for a price.

593
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,100
If this happened, when would it be?

594
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,400
You could be out in perhaps three years.

595
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Too long.
- No, it isn't.

596
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And with a good job,
the time will pass very quickly.

597
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,100
Listen, my friend.

598
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
You owe me nothing.

599
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,200
Tell me what you want.

600
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,200
A boat.

601
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
I should have known.

602
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,380
Papi, don't you remember me?

603
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,400
Clusiot.

604
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,500
Yeah.

605
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,595
What happened to your eyes?

606
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:38,100
I put some ground-up castor beans in 'em,
so I'd look sick enough to get in here.

607
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,700
Why?

608
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,600
I'm going with you.

609
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,700
What?

610
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Yeah. Listen....

611
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,400
Dega's got you on the x-ray list
for tomorrow.

612
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,200
The x-ray doctor, he's a convict.
Some kind of Hindu or something.

613
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,000
He's got somebody on the outside
who can sell you a boat...

614
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,225
...if the price is right.

615
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
When do we run, Papi?

616
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,800
Soon. I'll talk to that doctor tomorrow.

617
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,500
The last boat I obtained was
for a sex murderer.

618
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,500
They shot him to pieces
six miles down the river, poor man.

619
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,200
But the boat stood up very well.

620
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,000
You have the heart of an ox.

621
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,200
What kind of a boat?

622
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,315
Fourteen feet, complete with compass,
sails, tools, clothes.

623
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,985
The generator begins. Science takes over.

624
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,000
You know, x-rays are quite worthless.
They always have been.

625
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,650
Lie down, please, on the back.

626
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,400
How much would it cost?

627
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,600
Fr 3,000 in advance, which you pay to me...

628
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,800
...and I pay to Pascal,
who provides everything.

629
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:01,400
Draw a deep breath, please,
and hold completely still.

630
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,900
Another Fr 3,000 you must pay directly
to Pascal when he delivers the boat.

631
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,550
Exhale, please, and turn over.

632
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,495
If I decide to make a deal,
how do we handle it?

633
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,305
Have no fear. Ways will be found.

634
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,940
Trust me for everything.

635
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,200
The last time I did that
cost me two years in solitary.

636
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,900
So, you have been cheated, eh?

637
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,500
Well, happily for you,
money doesn't tempt me.

638
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,085
I'm after bigger game.
Draw a deep breath.

639
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,600
You see...

640
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,900
...l killed my whole family.

641
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,570
All of them. My wife and four little ones.

642
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,335
Exhale, if you haven't already.

643
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,590
You double-cross me, I'll kill ya.

644
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
Of course...

645
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,300
...l would consider that a favor.

646
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,400
A very great favor.

647
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,800
One of these nights I might ask you
to take that Turnkey into the toilet.

648
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:27,915
Show him a good time.
When you come out you'll get Fr 1,000.

649
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,400
Why?

650
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,800
That's my business. Your business is
to make him happy for ten minutes.

651
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,900
Fr 1,000.

652
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,600
He's filthy.

653
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:43,035
All right, Fr 2,000.
Does that make him any cleaner?

654
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,700
You think I'm a whore, don't you?

655
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,700
Easy.

656
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
Well, you're wrong.

657
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,300
Next.

658
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,615
I'll do what you ask, on one condition:

659
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,300
You keep your money
and you take me with you.

660
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,300
No.

661
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,140
I'm the only one
who can get you out of here.

662
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,600
You're--
- I know.

663
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,700
I'm a queer, a fairy, a pouf, huh?

664
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,700
But there's one thing you forgot.

665
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,800
You may have been framed,
as you say you were...

666
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,500
...but I wasn't.

667
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,640
Between the two of us...

668
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,655
...I'm the one who's killed a man, not you.

669
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,300
Okay.

670
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,720
It's tonight during the concert.

671
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,350
I'll be there. I have to.
I'm serving refreshments.

672
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,200
I think you ought to go with us, Louis.

673
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,340
You ought to.
- Thank you.

674
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,200
But my wife is arranging for my release.

675
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,935
The letter from her is overdue.

676
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,100
Listen to me.

677
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,000
If your wife was here and you were in Paris
with all that money...

678
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,800
...how much would you pay
to get her back?

679
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
Everything I have.

680
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,170
And how much would she pay
to get you back?

681
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,410
That's why you should run.

682
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,400
Now, Louis, while you've got a chance.

683
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,560
But I have a chance without running.

684
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,300
Me, they can kill...

685
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
...you, they own.

686
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,300
Goodbye.

687
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,400
Good luck.

688
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,400
Clusiot.

689
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,300
Clusiot.

690
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,100
Halt.

691
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,100
Dega, you bastard.

692
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,000
Guard.
- Shut up.

693
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,100
Guard.

694
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,400
Guard.

695
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,700
Guard.

696
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,700
Pull.

697
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,700
Pull.

698
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,300
Pull.

699
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,300
Let's go.

700
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,500
Where's Clusiot?

701
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,600
A guard got him.

702
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,700
Let's go.

703
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,600
Here. Here.

704
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,700
Where's the other one?
- Right here.

705
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,800
Just a little twist.

706
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,100
Come on, come on.

707
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,965
There's your boat over there.

708
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,100
Fr 3,000.

709
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,800
You'd better check her out,
see if she's okay.

710
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,700
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

711
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,800
Let's go. Let's go.

712
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:52,900
I wouldn't use those guns if you don't want
the man hunters down on you.

713
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,720
I put two gallons of rum aboard.

714
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,655
Send me a postcard
when you get to Honduras.

715
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,135
Let's have a drink of that rum.

716
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,600
Why, this...

717
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,500
...goddamn boat's no good.

718
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,200
Look at it. I'll kill that bastard.

719
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,300
The son of a bitch is made of kindling.

720
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,400
So is my leg.

721
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,100
I didn't twist my ankle, I fractured it.

722
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,200
You broke your leg?

723
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,600
Why didn't you say something?

724
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,100
I had the unworthy suspicion
you might leave me behind.

725
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,900
You're goddamn right I would have.

726
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It's broken, all right.

727
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,100
We've got to set this.

728
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,300
I need your help.

729
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,700
I presume it'll be painful.

730
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,400
You bet it will.

731
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,500
I ask you to remember that
that's my money that's sinking...

732
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,100
...and that I'm here out of an act
of unnatural heroism...

733
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,000
...which prevented a guard
from shooting you.

734
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,700
He probably would have
missed me anyway.

735
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,700
Now relax.

736
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,800
What?
- Relax.

737
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,000
You're at the wrong end.

738
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,805
It'll only last a couple minutes.

739
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,635
Jesus.
- Hold him above the knee.

740
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,700
Ready?

741
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,900
That finishes it.

742
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
How'd you do that?

743
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,600
We've all got our sensitive spots.

744
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,000
What happened?

745
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,265
He found a sensitive spot
you didn't know you had.

746
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Move and you're dead.

747
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,100
Turn around.

748
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,575
Throw that gun out in front of you.

749
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:19,000
You know I get Fr 200 for one of these.

750
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,000
I wouldn't want to lose it.

751
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,100
Turn around.

752
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:29,100
You and two others broke out
of Saint Laurent last night, didn't you?

753
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,300
That's right.

754
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,200
The others are at the boat?

755
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,200
That's right.

756
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,600
And the boat's no good.

757
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,700
Not worth a damn.

758
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,700
Been expecting you.

759
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,300
Come on.

760
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,200
Don't shoot. It's okay.

761
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:05,000
Caught these two man hunters asleep
just before sunup.

762
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,200
They've been hanging around
for two days waiting on ya.

763
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:15,080
Each time he sells that boat,
it's in worse shape than the last time.

764
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,300
You like this?

765
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,400
Oh, very much.

766
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,900
I did too, at the time, but I was drunk.

767
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Here, take this.

768
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,200
Cut yourself some bamboo
from around here...

769
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:33,910
...and lash it together with sailcloth.
I'll be back around sunset.

770
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,115
I'll tow you up river to Pigeon Island.

771
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:42,200
You can get a boat there,
if you've got enough money.

772
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,600
If you haven't got enough money
they'll probably kill ya.

773
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,950
It doesn't matter much to them.
They're all lepers.

774
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,600
Noisy son of a bitch.

775
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,200
Do dogs carry leprosy?

776
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,500
Well...

777
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,800
...the hell with it.

778
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
You better take this--

779
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,500
I don't want to fight these people.

780
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,510
I just want to try to talk them out of a boat.

781
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,400
Who are you?

782
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,495
Escaped prisoner, Papillon.

783
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,800
Where are the other two?

784
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,110
They're down on the beach.

785
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,325
One's got a broken ankle.

786
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Come in.

787
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,200
You have two rifles.

788
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,100
That's right.

789
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,200
And you want a boat.

790
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,500
That's right.

791
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,810
But you're short of money.

792
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,600
That's right, too.

793
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:13,000
Why don't you have the courtesy
to look at me when you speak?

794
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:28,895
We do a lot of smuggling here.
We raid the mainland. We steal boats.

795
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,700
When an outsider comes in...

796
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,795
...we generally kill him,
as a security measure.

797
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,700
That makes sense.

798
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Well...

799
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,060
...a man of Christian understanding.

800
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,300
Do you like cigars?

801
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,100
When I can get 'em.

802
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
Try this one.

803
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,185
How did you know I have dry leprosy,
that it isn't contagious?

804
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,100
I didn't.

805
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:01,700
In normal weather you should
sight Honduras in three and a half...

806
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,800
...maybe four weeks.

807
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,600
When you get there,
you'll need some money.

808
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,700
We passed the hat.

809
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,710
Take it, it's disinfected.

810
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:21,825
If you're going to catch leprosy, it's better
to catch it from money than from people.

811
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,400
Take it.

812
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:30,820
All we use it for is gambling...

813
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,500
...bringing in women lepers from Albina.

814
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,905
We've always got enough for that.

815
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:47,640
Hurry up. Get on board,
you'll miss the tide.

816
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,400
Goodbye.

817
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,600
Honduras.

818
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:07,500
My leg. Get it off my leg.

819
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,600
It's on my leg.

820
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,700
Goddamn it.

821
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,700
All right, come on.

822
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,700
Come on, one more.

823
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,285
I'm already so drunk I can't think.
- Yeah.

824
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,600
That's what I want.

825
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,870
I want you to put this between your teeth.

826
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,850
It's going to hurt you, Louis.

827
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:37,100
If you want to yell, yell.

828
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,200
I certainly will.

829
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,200
I fooled you.
- What?

830
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,300
I fooled you, didn't l?

831
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,300
One moment, please, seores.

832
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,200
What do you want, Sergeant?

833
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:41,000
Identification. Who are you?

834
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,490
We're fishermen. Our friend here--

835
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,900
Goddamn it, we...

836
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
...we made it.

837
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,600
Amigo.

838
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,700
Por favor.

839
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,200
Those bastards trussed me up like a pig.

840
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
Trackers.

841
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,225
Show your papers, please.

842
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Por favor.

843
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,800
Seor...

844
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Dinero, por favor.

845
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,700
What was your crime?

846
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:24,300
Murder.

847
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,800
I wasn't guilty.
I've never killed anybody in my life.

848
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:33,745
If you did regain your freedom,
what would you do with it?

849
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:36,600
I haven't had much time to think about that.

850
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:40,300
If you are a thief or a murderer,
by morning...

851
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:44,055
...you might have stolen
everything we have.

852
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:51,305
These are mine. They were a gift.

853
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,880
You keep 'em, until I leave.

854
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,200
Are you awake?

855
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,300
Yes, ma'am.

856
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:38,000
If you are sinful, you have made amends
by feeding half the poor in Santa Marta.

857
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:41,300
If you are truly not sinful,
you have nothing to fear.

858
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,440
God will watch over you.

859
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:03,700
Your five years in solitary confinement
are at an end.

860
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:07,200
You've paid part of your debt to France.

861
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,900
Papi.

862
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:12,300
I'm free.

863
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:55,015
That's the only way off Devil's Island.

864
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:00,520
We try to take things easy here.

865
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:04,100
The sharks and the tide do
the real guard work...

866
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:06,835
...so it's live and let live...

867
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:09,595
...unless you make trouble.

868
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,700
That one's empty.
You might as well take it.

869
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,800
But watch yourself around the other huts.

870
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:22,065
Someone might take you for a poacher
and kill you.

871
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:05,000
How dare you sit there.

872
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:08,400
This bench belongs to Captain Dreyfus.

873
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:11,305
Who are you to sit on that bench?

874
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,700
Nobody.

875
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:16,000
That's right. Nobody.

876
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,600
Do you know who I am?

877
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,400
Dega?

878
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,700
Dega.

879
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,600
Dega.

880
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,400
Dega.

881
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,400
Louis.

882
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:41,700
Louis.

883
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:48,480
I wish you hadn't come here.

884
02:13:58,700 --> 02:14:00,825
Are you fond of crayfish?

885
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:34,300
Good.

886
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,300
You really think so?

887
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,700
Best I've had in years.

888
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,995
Did you hear about my wife?

889
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:54,065
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

890
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:57,500
...although actually,
it doesn't really matter.

891
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:02,615
I mean, it all works out to the same thing,
don't you think?

892
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:11,670
Well, I have not heard from her in about--

893
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,410
It is nice here, isn't it?

894
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:19,895
You've made it nice, Louis.

895
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,600
Really nice.

896
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,400
It's funny...

897
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,665
...you and me ending up here.

898
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,425
We're the only ones left.

899
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:40,200
Do you ever wonder about it?

900
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:42,300
No.

901
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:45,600
I do.

902
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:50,200
Get away.

903
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Get away. Get away.

904
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,400
That's enough.

905
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,500
They come in, steal from my garden.

906
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,600
Who does?

907
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,200
Maybe I'd better go.

908
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:22,300
Yes.

909
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:28,770
I know your house. There's no ghost in it.

910
02:17:04,402 --> 02:17:06,528
My thoughts are with you.

911
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:37,100
Jesus.

912
02:18:07,202 --> 02:18:09,203
Louis.

913
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,402
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

914
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:14,402
They've come up.

915
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:15,702
We'll have carrots.

916
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:18,702
It said six weeks on the packet
but it's only taken four.

917
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:22,500
If I could find a way to get off this island,
would you like to come with me?

918
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:24,000
Oh, yes, of course.

919
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:27,840
Get away.
Freddie, you know better than that.

920
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,702
I've got no money. They took it all.

921
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:32,202
Forget about that.

922
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,702
You can't buy your way out of here.

923
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
Then how?

924
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,102
I don't know yet.

925
02:18:38,202 --> 02:18:41,802
Then, then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

926
02:18:41,902 --> 02:18:47,342
I have some extra seeds.
You might like to start your own garden.

927
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,710
You see, it's a horseshoe.

928
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,902
When the waves break
they have no place else to go...

929
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
...except go back out again.

930
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:22,302
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

931
02:19:22,402 --> 02:19:26,302
In fact, there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

932
02:19:26,402 --> 02:19:30,602
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw 'em over...

933
02:19:30,702 --> 02:19:32,703
...float out on a wave.

934
02:19:34,402 --> 02:19:36,403
Then what happens?

935
02:19:36,702 --> 02:19:41,886
The mainland's only 24 miles.
You just drift with the current.

936
02:19:43,702 --> 02:19:45,677
Only two days.

937
02:19:45,727 --> 02:19:47,727
You're certain?
- Yeah.

938
02:19:49,702 --> 02:19:52,702
It seems so, so desperate.

939
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Yeah.

940
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,800
You think it will work?

941
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,800
Does it matter?

942
02:20:07,902 --> 02:20:10,402
Get. Now, that's not yours.

943
02:20:10,902 --> 02:20:12,102
Now, you get away.

944
02:20:12,202 --> 02:20:15,500
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

945
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,602
Freddie's not feeling well today and...

946
02:20:17,702 --> 02:20:20,676
...you should appreciate that fact.

947
02:20:20,702 --> 02:20:22,703
Here we are.

948
02:20:24,702 --> 02:20:26,102
Okay, little one.

949
02:20:26,202 --> 02:20:28,203
All right.

950
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:31,600
Freddie.

951
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,702
Freddie, that's not for you, that's Adam's.

952
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,800
Come here, Adam.

953
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Let's take a walk.

954
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,246
Certainly. Isn't that a little small?

955
02:20:43,902 --> 02:20:46,961
It's just to try it with.
- Certainly.

956
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:52,380
You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

957
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:56,602
There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

958
02:20:56,702 --> 02:20:59,602
Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

959
02:20:59,702 --> 02:21:02,421
What do you think, huh?
- Come on.

960
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,800
It was the wrong wave.

961
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:35,300
Oh, yeah.

962
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:38,602
They come in a series of seven.

963
02:23:38,702 --> 02:23:41,102
And the seventh wave is big enough...

964
02:23:41,202 --> 02:23:45,368
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

965
02:23:46,402 --> 02:23:47,402
Are you certain?

966
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:49,500
Yeah.

967
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:52,100
Excellent.

968
02:23:56,300 --> 02:24:00,380
Oh, if we're going
I'd better pick those carrots.

969
02:24:14,702 --> 02:24:16,703
Fourth wave.

970
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,702
Ready?

971
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:30,010
I must tell you something.

972
02:24:30,402 --> 02:24:33,632
Louis, you don't have to say anything.

973
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I meant to.

974
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:40,100
I'm sorry.

975
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:43,300
I know.

976
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:48,500
You'll be killed.

977
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,800
You know that?

978
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:53,300
Maybe.

979
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:55,600
Please, don't do it.

980
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:42,202
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here.

981
02:27:55,402 --> 02:27:57,783
Papillon made it to freedom.

982
02:27:58,702 --> 02:28:03,716
And for the remaining years of his life
he lived a free man.

983
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:08,902
This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...

984
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
...did not survive him.
