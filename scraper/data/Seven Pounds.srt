2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay.

3
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
911 emergency.

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,880
I need an ambulance.

5
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,600
I have you at 9212 west third street
in los angeles.

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes, room number 2.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,840
What's the emergency?

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,320
There's been a suicide.

9
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,440
Who's the victim?

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,040
I am.

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,600
In seven days,
god created the world.

12
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,080
And in seven seconds...

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,280
... i shattered mine.

14
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,880
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

15
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,240
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

16
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Yes, sir. I'll just need
your first and last name...

17
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,640
...so i can call up your account.
- You know what?

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,720
Here's what i'm thinking, ezra. I think
i'm gonna mail you the meat back...

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddling.

20
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,960
That won't be necessary, sir.

21
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,960
So how about we just start
with your last name?

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Thomas.

23
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,760
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm not much of a meat eater myself,
but i hear really great things...

26
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
...about the pork.

27
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,280
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.

28
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,280
Are you jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, ezra?

29
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,960
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, mr. Thomas?

30
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Ben.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,320
Hold on, what was that voice?

32
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,840
I don't... i don't have an order
for a ben thomas.

33
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,440
Ezra, what was that voice?

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,160
- What voice?
- Are you blind?

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,880
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.

36
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,280
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,120
Now, that... that is rich.
That is rich.

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
Have you ever had sex, ezra?

39
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,800
Did lawrence in accounting
put you up to this?

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,280
Because somehow i can't imagine
the blind, vegan...

41
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,720
... beef salesman having sex.

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,200
- Listen, i'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, ezra.

45
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,760
Because i look at my life, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,120
... and you can't see shit.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,040
Is that fair?

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Does that seem fair to you, ezra?

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
Do you even know
what color the ocean is?

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Do you?

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,720
- It's blue, sir.
- "it's blue, sir."

52
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Say what you wanna say.

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,360
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,280
Thank you for calling
cheyenne meats.

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,280
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,520
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman,
virgin coward!

57
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,840
- Goodbye, mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,240
Yes. Hello, i'm looking for emily.

64
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,160
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.

65
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.

66
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,000
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

67
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,480
She asked me to watch duke
until she got back.

68
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
Okay.

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,280
You ever try mixing banana peel
into the soil?

70
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,400
- Really?
- It works, i swear.

71
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Oh, would you by chance
know where i could find her?

72
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,800
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.

73
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Cardiac wing?

74
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Take the elevator to the fifth floor
then turn left.

75
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,160
Thank you.

76
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,480
Well, that's what i was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

77
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,800
Hold the elevator.

78
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
Thank you.

79
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Can i help you?

80
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Yes. Good evening.

81
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm here to see emily posa.

82
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. To 4 p.m.

83
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,520
You know, it is really important
i speak to her for just a moment.

84
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,360
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

85
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,960
Thank you very much.

86
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,520
So if there is one thing
that i have learned...

87
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,520
...and you all should remember
about winning these contracts:

88
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,400
Three steps. First, tell them
what you're gonna tell them.

89
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Step two, you tell them.

90
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Step three,
tell them what you told them.

91
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,720
We are gonna close
by reminding them...

92
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,440
...that old girl has a 3-percent better
impulse from sea level to vacuum...

93
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,600
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another sputnik.

94
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Now, if you will excuse me...

95
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,600
...i have a very lovely, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

96
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
Sarah.

97
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
Honey.

98
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight-savings time.

99
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,480
You were supposed
to be here a while ago.

100
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,840
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time. It's work.

101
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,280
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, i'm angry with you.

102
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm gonna be angry all night long.

103
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,280
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?

104
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,320
How about that?
How about i'm angry with you?

105
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,560
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

106
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
Where are you?

107
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,400
I'm at the beach house.

108
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,080
Are you okay?

109
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,960
Of course.

110
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,280
Listen, why'd you disconnect
the landline?

111
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,280
The phone broke.

112
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,760
I don't need it anymore.

113
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Did i? Did i do something?

114
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,520
No.

115
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,160
Not unless you're smoking again.

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,360
No, i've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

117
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?

118
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,720
- You sound terrible again and...
- yeah, i'm fine. Look, i gotta go.

119
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
Give melanie and the kids
a hug and a kiss.

120
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,920
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

121
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,200
Hold on. I know it's been a while,
but when you were staying here...

122
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,280
...you didn't take something of mine
by mistake, did you?

123
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,720
I remember giving you something.

124
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
You remember that?
Because i remember that very clearly.

125
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,280
Just remember i love you.

127
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,440
Hi, my name is ben thomas.
I'm here to see stewart goodman.

128
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,960
Inez, look at me, please.

129
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

130
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,040
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

131
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,960
No, no, no.

132
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,920
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, inez?

133
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,800
I mean, this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,280
Inez, how can we help you if...?

135
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,880
Okay, how about i come back
tomorrow...

136
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,000
...and see if you've changed
your mind, okay?

137
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Thattagirl.

138
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,600
I thought i was coming
to your office today.

139
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,200
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
i'd stop by, save you the drive.

140
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,840
Terrific. Well, look, let's go talk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

141
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,440
I take a no-nonsense approach.

142
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,840
I mean, i cut the operating costs
of this place...

143
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,640
...over 17 percent last year alone.

144
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,240
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

145
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Now, if i could only get
my own finances...

146
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,400
...in that kind of shape,
i wouldn't have you sitting here.

147
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,840
No offense.

148
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
That your new beemer out front?

149
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Ben, i mean, when i found out...

150
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,800
...that my bone-marrow transplant
wasn't successful...

151
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
i'm well aware of your
ongoing medical condition.

152
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,400
Things aren't looking
very promising for me.

153
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,840
Look...

154
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,160
...i have a bonus coming in january.

155
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,640
I just really need
this six-month extension.

156
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,360
Really, i mean, i am doing the very
best i can here, i promise you.

157
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm gonna show myself out.

158
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I'll be in touch.

159
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,280
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

160
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,960
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

161
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
Hello.

162
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,160
My name is ben.

163
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,040
I totally understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

164
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,360
But i would really like
to just have a moment of your time.

165
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man stewart goodman is.

166
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,400
It is within my power to drastically
change his circumstances.

167
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,280
But i don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

168
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,640
I need you to tell me
whether or not he is a good person.

169
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,960
"The drug he gives me...

170
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,120
...makes me dizzy.

171
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,640
I want a new one."

172
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,040
Well, that sounds
very reasonable, inez.

173
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,520
What else?

174
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,640
You can trust me.

175
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,120
What else, inez?

176
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
He's punishing you?

177
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,520
How is he punishing you?

178
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,560
How is he punishing you, inez?

179
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,800
Ben?

180
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,040
- Hey, ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?

181
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
To the right. Is there a problem?

182
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,440
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.

183
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,800
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,440
You have the wrong
impression here.

185
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

186
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,880
...make sure you're showing
these people some respect.

187
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,280
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

188
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,560
You don't treat people like that.

189
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
Let me explain, okay, ben?

190
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,520
- And i'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!

191
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm not giving you anything.

192
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,040
I almost believed you,
you son of a bitch.

193
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,600
I almost believed.

194
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Okay. Grip and rip.

195
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,200
This time it's gonna be
a lot different.

196
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,560
Hey.

197
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,200
- Hey, michelle.
- Hey.

198
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,400
- Good to see you.
- You too.

199
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,720
- How are you?
- I'm good.

200
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,040
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

201
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,160
Just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass at everything.

202
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,240
And i am.

203
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,120
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.

204
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,280
All right.

205
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,840
You okay?

206
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,560
Yeah, i'm good. You said you were
gonna call me on the 15th.

207
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,160
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.

208
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
Doctor didn't have the results,
so i had no information to give you.

209
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,760
Still, you should call me.

210
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,560
- Yeah, i know. Yes, i know.
- We're still friends. Right?

211
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,640
Yeah. I'm just...

212
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
i'm doing some soul-searching,
you know?

213
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Don't do that.

214
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,400
- We have a plan.
- I know.

215
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,920
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

216
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,240
You know, they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

217
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
I'm well aware of that.

218
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,640
I think i'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

219
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
Were you looking at him,
or were you looking at me?

220
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Actually, i was just sitting here.

221
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,080
Am i doing it wrong?

222
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,600
I think i saw you
in the elevator the other day.

223
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,720
Oh, yes.

224
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,920
Actually, you are being audited.

225
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,120
My name is ben thomas.

226
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm with the irs,
and you owe the government...

227
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,080
...$56, 240.19.

228
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,040
I know.

229
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,640
And now you get me.

230
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,720
Would you have a seat, please,
miss posa?

231
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,160
So i've been looking over
the income statements...

232
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,800
...from the last three years.

233
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,480
- 2005...
- were...?

234
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Were you in my room
the other night?

235
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,720
No, ma'am, i was not
in your room the other night.

236
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,720
That's not exactly irs protocol.

237
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,240
So i've been looking over
'05, '06 and '07.

238
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and...

239
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,920
mr. Thomas?

240
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,920
I just got discharged.

241
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,440
So, you know,
unless you're gonna, like...

242
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
...haul me off
to some irs jail or something...

243
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,280
...i'd really like to get home now.

244
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,440
- Oh, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

245
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,080
I'll be in touch.

246
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,880
Welcome to the travel inn.
Can i help you?

247
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,400
I need a room.

248
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,040
How many hours?

249
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,400
About two weeks.

250
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,440
Clear it! That's it, that's it!

251
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,520
All right, come on!  vamos,  manny!

252
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,080
All right, all right. That's it, that's it.

253
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,800
Hey!

254
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,920
- What you want?
- Break it up!

255
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,480
- You want some of this?
- Get off! Get off!

256
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,960
Hey, rico, knock it off!

257
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,440
Somebody wanna remind rico
where we are?

258
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,480
The sanctuary, coach!

259
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,520
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

260
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,400
That's right, rico, in the sanctuary.

261
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

262
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,240
Hello, this is emily posa.

263
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,520
I'm not home right now,
but please leave a message...

264
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,440
... and i'll call you back
as soon as possible. Thank you.

265
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,280
Hi, my name is susan nall.
I'm calling because a friend...

266
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,920
... told me you do letterpress
invitations, and i was wondering...

267
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,720
hello? Hi, this is emily.

268
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,920
Yep, i do wedding invitations.

269
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm not able to take any requests,
though, right now.

270
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,880
I know someone nearby who does it.

271
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,040
She's not as good as i am,
but her prices are very...

272
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
hello?

273
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
Duke?

274
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Duke.

275
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,600
We're out here.

276
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,320
Hello, miss posa.

277
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,680
What are you doing here?

278
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,360
Oh, i came to see you.

279
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,920
Don't you people ever call ahead?

280
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,000
You people tend to try
to hide things.

281
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
Is that meat?

282
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,120
No! No, no.

283
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,680
No. No meat. No.

284
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,200
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.

285
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,880
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

286
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

287
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,760
Well, that sucks.

288
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,480
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?

289
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
No.

290
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,120
Actually, i have to take duke
for a walk.

291
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,200
No problem. I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

292
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,560
- So...
- hey, hey.

293
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,240
Hey.

294
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,320
So i've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007.

295
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Now...

296
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
i'm listening.

297
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,960
- Can i get him for you?
- Nope. I got him.

298
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,080
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

299
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,080
- You all right?
- Yes.

300
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,120
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

301
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,640
- That's okay. Watch...
- no, no. Heel, heel, heel.

302
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
feed him meat.

303
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
So i've been looking over...

304
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,480
- yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

305
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,280
So you cook it all
ahead of time, i see.

306
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,640
No, actually. I can't remember
the last time i cooked.

307
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,960
This is my sister's way
of looking out for me from afar.

308
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,680
Do you have any siblings?

309
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
Yes, one brother.

310
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,040
He's a... he's a good egg.

311
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,040
Yeah, i just have the one sister too.

312
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,920
Are you receiving income
from any source...

313
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,400
...that the government
is currently unaware of?

314
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,760
Well, lately i've been taking
to diving in local wishing wells, so...

315
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,200
i mean, but it's just occasional dimes
here and there...

316
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,120
...or, once in a while, a quarter.

317
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,600
No, actually...

318
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,360
...i had to refinance this place
to pay my past-due medical bills.

319
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,440
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenital heart failure.

320
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,160
Yes. Did you gather that
while stalking me at the hospital?

321
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,600
No, i...

322
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,520
you're currently status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

323
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,040
...to be on the national unos
waiting list...

324
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,160
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospital...

325
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,560
...and placed on status 1.

326
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,960
So basically, if your heart starts to fail
quickly and no donor can be located...

327
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,400
...you're screwed.

328
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,760
Is it true that you said...

329
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,880
...that you do not believe
that you even deserve a heart...

330
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,240
...because your life is unremarkable
in every way?

331
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm sorry.

332
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,560
I don't know why i said that.
I'm sorry.

333
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,920
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

334
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,560
...to join the irs, mr. Thomas?

335
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,080
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

336
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,000
So you don't consider yourself
a good person?

337
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,480
How would you answer that question
if i asked you the same?

338
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,240
"Unremarkable" would be
an upgrade for me...

339
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,280
...i assure you.

340
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncollectible until further notice.

341
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm sure that'll buy you
five or six months, penalty-free.

342
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,920
Here's my card.

343
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,560
If anyone from the irs
tries to contact you...

344
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,880
...you call me immediately.

345
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,600
Okay.

346
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,320
Thank you.

347
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,800
Thank you.

348
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Okay.

349
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,120
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.

350
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,000
Why do i get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

351
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,240
Because i get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

352
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,120
All right?

353
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,000
You off to?

354
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,960
You off to pollute
someone else's dog now?

355
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,720
No.

356
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,520
Just going home.

357
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,280
Where's that?

358
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,680
Take care, emily.

359
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,560
You too.

360
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,240
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.

361
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,840
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

362
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,120
Because it's my room.

363
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,760
And i don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

364
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,360
Well, i don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

365
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,640
I think i can.

366
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,280
Well, i've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

367
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
Now you do.

368
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,600
Who?

369
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
Good night.

370
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,360
The first time i ever saw
a box jellyfish...

371
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,240
... i was 12.

372
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,400
Our father took us
to the monterey bay aquarium.

373
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,840
I never forgot when he said...

374
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,960
... that it was the most
deadly creature on earth.

375
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
To me it was just...

376
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
... the most beautiful thing
i'd ever seen.

377
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
I spoke to the doctor again.

378
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,880
He's gonna send over your files
in the morning.

379
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,960
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.

380
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,600
- Any questions?
- Same one.

381
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Well, same answer, then.

382
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,760
You know, i was thinking last night
about when we were 14...

383
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
...and we made our big pact.

384
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,400
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

385
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,200
...we agreed that we would never,
never date each other's girls?

386
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,560
I remembered that that night you told
me how much you liked stacy miller...

387
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,560
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And i said:

388
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,440
"Hey, man. You can't.
Her and i already did it."

389
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Which we didn't, but i wanted to...

390
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,320
...but she liked you way more
than she liked me, and...

391
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,560
so i lied to you
because i was so jealous.

392
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,280
And i realized that i've been
carrying around this lie...

393
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,720
...in my heart for the last 25...

394
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,280
stop it!

395
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,720
Stop it.

396
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,920
Stay focused.

397
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
Do what you promised me.

398
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,160
- What, you think i'm...?
- Do what you promised me.

399
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,960
You think i'm gonna
let you down now, don't you?

400
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,160
I've known you my whole damn life!

401
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,480
Okay?

402
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,080
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

403
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,640
Okay? This is...
this is not easy for me.

404
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,840
I'll make sure everything goes
as planned.

405
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,640
Don't worry.

406
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,920
Thank you.

407
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Oh, my god.

408
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,960
Hello, holly.

409
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,120
Look at you.

410
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,160
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

411
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,480
- Really?
- You have a minute?

412
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,080
Sure. Come on in.

413
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,240
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

414
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
You look great.

415
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,160
- I do?
- Yes.

416
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
I feel great.

417
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,040
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

418
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,400
I need a favor.

419
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,400
Whatever you need, just ask me.

420
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,920
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

421
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,160
Someone having
a really hard time...

422
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,000
...that needs help, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

423
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,760
What are you doing?

424
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm helping.

425
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,160
I need a name.

426
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,400
Okay.

427
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,240
Connie tepos.

428
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,840
Her boyfriend almost killed her
last year when she tried to leave.

429
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,200
He broke three of her ribs
last month.

430
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,280
She's scared to death
to press charges...

431
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,520
... and we can't do anything.

432
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,160
- Hello.
- Hi.

433
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,600
- Connie tepos?
- Yes?

434
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,920
My name is ben thomas.
I'm with the irs.

435
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,280
Irs? But i always pay my taxes.

436
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,160
Yes, this is more of
a general inquiry.

437
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,720
I don't understand. What...?

438
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,240
May i come in?

439
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,400
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

440
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,640
It's very important for your family.

441
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,080
For my family?

442
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,840
Beautiful.

443
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,360
Please, have a seat.

444
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,680
What's this all about?

445
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,880
Your case has come to my attention.

446
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,000
And i wanted to get to know you.

447
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,160
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

448
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,680
Because i'd like to help you.

449
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,680
I don't understand.

450
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,880
I'm aware of your case.

451
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,920
And your boyfriend.

452
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,080
What are you talking about?

453
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,240
You know what i'm talking about.

454
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,080
No, i have no idea
what you're talking about.

455
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,880
Kids, go to your room.

456
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
He's coming back?

457
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,120
He's not coming back.

458
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,840
You said you were from the irs,
but you're lying to me.

459
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,760
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.

460
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,200
Who sent you here?

461
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,040
Please sit down.

462
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
I'm not going to sit down.

463
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,680
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

464
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,080
You come into my house.

465
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,120
You talking to me
about  mi caso y mi  boyfriend?

466
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,360
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

467
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,280
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.

468
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,480
You can trust me.

469
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,880
I trust no one, mr. Thomas.

470
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,440
I talked to holly.

471
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,240
I can get you out of here.

472
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,360
To a safe place. A beautiful place.

473
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,080
Why did you talk to holly?

474
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,800
Your children are in danger here.

475
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,800
Don't talk about my kids,
mr. Thomas.

476
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,960
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.

477
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,760
Get out of my house now
or i'm gonna call the police.

478
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,600
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?

479
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,120
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.

480
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,160
I want you to take my card,
and call me...

481
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,040
- i don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.

482
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay. Thank you. Get out right now.

483
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,400
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave? This is my house.

484
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
Please, just think about it.

485
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
I don't need you.

486
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,640
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.

487
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,200
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.

488
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm gonna meet you at the house.

489
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,280
Look, no. I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling. I'll talk to you next week.

490
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,520
No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

491
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,600
Wouldn't wanna get
on her bad side.

492
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,280
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.

493
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,600
How you doing, you two?

494
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,400
I'm good.

495
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,600
Got a big day.

496
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,680
Yep. No more dialysis, george.
See you in the o.r.

497
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,440
Yep.

498
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,000
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,680
Thank you.

500
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,240
So i heard you raised
enough money...

501
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,440
...to give a couple of the kids
partial scholarships to college.

502
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
It's no big deal.

503
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,920
I just convinced a couple
of bigwig donors...

504
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,840
...that what the world really needs
to see is more latinos on ice.

505
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,400
You know, ben,
i keep asking you this...

506
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,680
...but why me?

507
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,440
Because you are a good man.

508
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,200
No, really.

509
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,880
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

510
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,600
Hello?

511
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,200
Hello?

512
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,760
Hello?

513
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,240
Okay, i can't hear you,
so try back again.

514
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,240
Gonna hang up now.

515
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,920
Bye.

516
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,760
Mr. Thomas?

517
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
We're ready for you.

518
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,240
These are beautiful.

519
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,400
Banana peels. Who knew?

520
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,960
Emily?

521
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,120
Can i get a refill?

522
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,520
- Susan?
- Yeah.

523
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,800
How's ryan?

524
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,240
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

525
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,880
Will you tell him for me that i'm ready
whenever he is for a free lesson?

526
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,200
Yeah, all right.

527
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,640
Things are kind of crazy right now
with school...

528
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,680
...but maybe when school's out.

529
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,480
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

530
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,200
How's the pie?

531
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,280
Oh, it's... it's good.

532
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,480
You gonna ask her out?

533
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,120
The waitress.

534
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,120
No.

535
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,040
You never know.

536
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,720
I don't... i don't think she sees me.

537
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,560
Good night, ezra.

538
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,160
Hello?

539
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,600
Ben?

540
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,640
Hi, i'm sorry to call so late.

541
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,360
Did...? Did someone
from the irs contact you?

542
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,360
No.

543
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,200
I just...

544
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,480
i was having trouble breathing after
i took duke for a walk, and i fainted.

545
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,040
An ambulance had to take me
to the hospital.

546
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,200
I'm so sorry.

547
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,480
I don't know why i even
called you. I'm sorry.

548
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,160
It's just that i have your card
with me, and...

549
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,400
ben?

550
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,280
Are you still there?

551
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,760
Yes.

552
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,640
Do you ever
think about dying, ben?

553
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,760
Every now and again.

554
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,560
My face is bluish.

555
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,720
It's not exactly a good sign.

556
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,400
You should try to rest. Just...

557
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,360
why don't you see
if you can get some sleep?

558
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,440
I like talking to you.

559
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,760
I like talking to you too.

560
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,440
Would you tell me a story, please?

561
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,360
Okay.

562
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,240
All right. Once upon a time...

563
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,400
... there was a little boy named...

564
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,840
oh, lucky me, you just got it
on reserve like that. Okay.

565
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,120
Let me guess. His name was ben.

566
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,480
No, actually,
this little boy's name is tim.

567
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,080
I like the name tim.

568
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,080
Go on.

569
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,640
Tim's little brother
was always pestering tim...

570
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,280
...to make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

571
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,800
But tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

572
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,640
Okay. Then what happened?

573
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,680
One day, tim went out
to the backyard...

574
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,680
...and he put leaves
and taped branches to his arms...

575
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,960
...and started climbing
the big oak tree.

576
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,880
His little brother said,
"tim, you can't fly."

577
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,440
And he said,
"yeah? You just watch."

578
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,760
He got all the way to the top
and jumped.

579
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
How tall was this tree?

580
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,000
It was... it was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.

581
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,840
Oh, my god...
this is a horrible story.

582
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,480
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

583
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,320
From that experience,
tim realized that he wanted to fly.

584
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,600
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

585
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,440
I thought you said
this was a good story.

586
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,640
Oh, well...

587
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,040
yeah, that is...

588
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,320
...until the dragons showed up.

589
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,400
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

590
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,880
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.

591
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,640
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

592
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,520
... with really bad attitudes.

593
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,440
I see.

594
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,280
I have an idea.

595
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,880
Why don't you try to fall asleep...

596
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,920
... and when you do,
i'll just hang up.

597
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,760
Okay.

598
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Ben?

599
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,880
Yes.

600
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,520
Thank you for listening.

601
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,640
And for talking.

602
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,800
Try to fall asleep.

603
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,880
Good night, ben.

604
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,840
Good night, emily.

605
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,960
Emily?

606
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,360
Emily?

607
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,280
I lied to you.

608
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,320
I think about dying every day.

609
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,680
Dr. King to nicu. Dr. Wesley king,
please report to nicu.

610
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,480
Hey.

611
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

612
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,760
When did you get here?

613
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,200
Last night, after we talked.

614
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,360
You slept here?

615
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,000
Good morning. How's our patient?

616
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,240
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

617
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,280
- Hello.
- Hi, ben. Is that right? Irs?

618
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,160
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

619
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,400
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please. Don't go.

620
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,240
He can... he can stay.

621
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,320
Whatever you want.

622
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,720
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

623
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
...to pump enough blood
to your brain.

624
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,840
It's enlarged
and it's starting to shut down.

625
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,920
How long?

626
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,600
It's entirely up to your heart.

627
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,680
Could be six weeks,
could be a month.

628
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,880
But we've upped you to status 1 b.

629
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,280
At least i'm on the list.

630
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,280
Not only that,
but we're giving you this pager.

631
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,160
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

632
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,280
The inotrope drug i started you on...

633
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,600
...it's gonna stabilize your
blood pressure within 24 hours.

634
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,240
Then what?

635
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,440
We wait.

636
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,560
- Can i do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

637
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,760
Okay.

638
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,160
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

639
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,760
If you want something else,
i can get you something else.

640
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,720
Would you stay?

641
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,280
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

642
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,640
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.

643
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,200
Okay. Okay.

644
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,600
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?

645
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,800
It's a dog. Just for one night.

646
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,520
No. Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

647
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,240
We have a dog policy here.

648
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,080
Little dogs only.
Poodles and shih tzus.

649
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,600
It's in the contract. It's english
and spanish for everyone to see.

650
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,400
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

651
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,600
It's a goddamn horse.

652
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,640
Well, let me know when you add
a horse policy to the contract.

653
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,680
Yes.

654
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,560
Mr. Thomas, it's connie tepos.

655
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey, connie.

656
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,720
I don't know why i'm calling you...

657
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,200
...but i'm calling you.

658
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,200
You said you could help us and...

659
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,760
can you really help us?

660
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,000
This just doesn't make any sense.

661
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,880
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.

662
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,600
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.

663
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,160
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.

664
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,720
Don't be weak.

665
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,560
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.

666
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,080
I'm strong.

667
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,680
Take this. Take it.

668
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,960
You are gonna start this car...

669
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,040
...and you're gonna go.

670
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,240
This is real,
and this is gonna be your new life.

671
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,080
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

672
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,640
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

673
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,640
Look how beautiful
those babies are.

674
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,160
I know, i know.

675
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,120
They deserve it.

676
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,920
Okay?

677
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,040
You're headed north up the coast.

678
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,520
Lorena. Lorena.

679
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,000
I've always believed
this place can heal the soul.

680
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,160
Mommy, the ocean.

681
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,080
Yes, the ocean.

682
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,800
I hope that proves true for you.

683
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,320
When you sign your name
on the dotted line of the contract...

684
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,080
... you'll own my house outright.

685
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,720
I only ask that you never mention
how you got the house...

686
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,560
... or try to contact me
for any reason.

687
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,760
And if you're wondering why you,
please stop.

688
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,280
All i ask is for you
to honor my wishes...

689
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,240
... and, of course,
live life abundantly.

690
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,280
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

691
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,280
Hi, duke.

692
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,520
Hi, baby.

693
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,720
What time does the nurse come?

694
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,760
She should be there
by the time i get home.

695
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,320
- Ben?
- Yes.

696
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,920
I know i'm the girl
with the broken wing.

697
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,400
But who are you?

698
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,200
Who am i?

699
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,400
I am your friendly neighborhood
tax collector.

700
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,080
Ben.

701
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,120
Where the hell did you come from?

702
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,960
I grew up in oakland.

703
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,440
Literally. Okay.

704
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,600
Where did you go to college?

705
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,000
As far from oakland as possible.

706
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,480
Massachusetts institute
of technology.

707
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,440
How about you?

708
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,640
Ucla.

709
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,240
You went to mit?

710
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,800
Like, the mit?

711
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:10,440
Oh, and now you're wondering how
i wound up as a lowly tax collector.

712
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,480
Absolutely.

713
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,400
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.

714
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,880
What from?

715
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,880
I always wanted to be an engineer.

716
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
An engineer?

717
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,520
What kind?

718
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,160
The kind that sent people
to the moon.

719
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,960
Really?

720
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,560
Yes.

721
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,000
I don't wanna talk
about me anymore.

722
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,440
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

723
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,440
Have you...?

724
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Have you ever been in love?

725
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,160
Emily, please.

726
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,920
Yes, you have.

727
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,520
Come on, you can tell me.

728
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,960
Yes.

729
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,600
But it ended.

730
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,360
- What happened?
- Stop it.

731
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,040
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- stop it.

732
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,040
You need to get some rest.

733
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,120
I'll call you tomorrow,
or maybe i'll stop by.

734
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,360
No, if i have questions tomorrow,
what then?

735
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,440
That's not a part of the deal.

736
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,120
What the hell does that mean?

737
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,920
Emily, hold on. Hold on.

738
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,160
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.

739
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,800
Wait!

740
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,880
Thank you for everything you did.

741
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,920
Did you like the eggs?

742
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,080
They were okay, i guess.

743
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,600
I don't like the eggs you buy.

744
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,760
Okay.

745
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,040
You're wearing suit pants.

746
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,560
To weed.

747
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,840
Yeah, i didn't... i didn't have
any other clothes with me.

748
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,360
- You know, i was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.

749
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,160
I figured i would just take the day off
and get this done for you.

750
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,600
Ben?

751
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,040
Yeah?

752
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,080
This is a really ridiculous apology.

753
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,640
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

754
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,680
Oh, no, i gotta finish.

755
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,680
You can finish tomorrow.

756
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,880
Come on.

757
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,400
This is where i used to work.

758
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,640
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

759
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,920
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?

760
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,960
This one is just shy of 120 years.

761
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,840
It's how i put out my line of letterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

762
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,800
What about this one?

763
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,200
That youngster...

764
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,200
...is the heidelberg windmill, 1956.

765
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,600
Call it "the beast."

766
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,640
Well, that seems appropriate.

767
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,640
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

768
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,440
And i can't find anybody to fix it.

769
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,120
It's kind of a dying art.

770
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,880
Defibrillator here works, though.

771
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,480
Luckily. It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?

772
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,320
Please.

773
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,280
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

774
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,840
...hate that we modern girls...

775
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,800
...want a deep impression.

776
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,440
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

777
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,040
...so that it didn't leave
an indentation.

778
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,480
Now it's the only way
to prove it's not digital.

779
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,880
I think it feels richer.

780
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,960
You okay?

781
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,120
Yeah.

782
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,520
Look, ben...

783
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,680
i don't really know anything about you
or where you came from...

784
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,200
...but you keep showing up.

785
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,240
And i'm glad.

786
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,640
Okay.

787
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,280
Okay.

788
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,720
So duke needs a walk.

789
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
Are you interested?

790
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,040
Yes.

791
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,400
Come on.

792
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,040
Hey, hey.

793
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,680
Right here.

794
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,640
There you go.

795
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,200
He's like a different dog
with you around.

796
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,520
I don't think we ever
properly bonded.

797
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,240
Why would you get such a big dog?

798
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:31,320
Did you know that great danes on
average only live about seven years?

799
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,360
They have heart issues.

800
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,280
I think i got him because...

801
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,480
...i thought he could help me
with my illness.

802
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,320
It'd be something
i could take care of...

803
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,160
...as opposed to being
always taken care of.

804
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,960
You know, just so you know,
i used to be really hot.

805
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,800
Like, unauditably hot.

806
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,320
Is that so?

807
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,000
Yeah.

808
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,120
I haven't felt like this
in a really long time.

809
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,560
There's so many things
that i wanna do.

810
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,800
I wanna go on a plane
for 13 hours...

811
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,520
...and not have to stress
that i can't reach my doctor.

812
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,000
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

813
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,880
See the world.

814
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,360
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that i am.

815
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,760
You know, what i like.

816
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,640
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

817
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,440
I would really like to go running.

818
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,600
I think about that sometimes.

819
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,080
What it would just feel like
to go running.

820
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,640
So...

821
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,240
...see you tomorrow?

822
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,280
Yes.

823
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,400
But if you need anything,
just call and i'll come right back.

824
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,120
Okay.

825
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,920
Bye.

826
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,280
I had a really great time today.

827
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,520
Me too.

828
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,640
Bye.

829
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,960
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

830
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,040
You're a brave guy.

831
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,120
How long have you
known nicholas?

832
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,920
What the hell happened to you?

833
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,920
Hey, how much longer
are you gonna stay in my hotel?

834
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,360
Motel.

835
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,400
How much longer?

836
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,360
Actually, i was planning
on dying here.

837
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,480
Well, then you need to pay
in advance.

838
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,480
Hello?

839
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,120
Hey, it's emily.

840
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,840
Are you sleeping?

841
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,840
Yes. No.

842
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,520
Is everything okay?

843
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,640
Yeah, i'm fine.

844
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,920
My sister came over for a couple
of days last week with the kids...

845
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,600
...and it was really great.

846
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,680
I tried calling you a couple times.

847
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,400
How are you doing?

848
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,400
Yeah, i'm good.

849
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,600
Everything's fine. I've been...

850
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,000
i've been traveling a lot, so...

851
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,880
well, are you busy tonight?

852
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,000
What do you mean?

853
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,800
I don't... maybe you wanna
come by and say hello?

854
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,840
Around 7?

855
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,520
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...

856
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,640
look, i totally get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girl, so...

857
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,120
i can... i can come at 7.

858
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,600
Okay.

859
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,160
Okay.

860
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,200
Bye.

861
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,120
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.

862
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,880
- How you doing?
- Have fun.

863
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

864
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,720
Come in.

865
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,160
I am so glad she's gone.

866
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,080
Are you okay if we eat outside?

867
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,560
Eating?

868
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,200
You didn't eat already, did you?

869
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,560
- No.
- Okay.

870
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,800
No.

871
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,200
Well, it was a surprise...

872
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,680
...but you're on time.

873
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:58,240
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better like it.

874
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,360
Or lie to me.

875
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,840
This is for you.

876
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,560
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... change in there.

877
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,280
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

878
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,040
Chop-chop.

879
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,600
You look great.

880
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,680
Yeah. It's pink.

881
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,880
It's salmon.

882
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
You are so nice.

883
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,320
So are you.

884
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,680
Everything's vegetarian.

885
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,360
I hope you like eggplant parmesan.

886
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,480
I haven't treated myself very well...

887
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,120
...in the past few years.

888
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,200
Start now.

889
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,640
All right.

890
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,720
What do you think?

891
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,400
It's delicious.

892
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,800
Glad you like it.

893
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,280
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

894
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,720
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

895
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,120
No, i can't sing anymore.

896
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,800
Oh, and a performance.

897
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,840
Oh, no.

898
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,120
Shall we?

899
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,040
You need to relax.

900
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,240
This is relaxed.

901
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,480
I have a surprise for you.

902
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,400
Surprise?

903
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,720
Yes.

904
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,960
For me?

905
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,560
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

906
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,240
And open.

907
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,400
Okay.

908
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,040
You cleaned the beast.

909
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,760
Actually, i fixed it.

910
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,400
No, you didn't.

911
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,320
Oh, okay, let's go, then.

912
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,520
Wait. Are you serious?

913
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,240
Try it.

914
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,320
Okay.

915
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,680
Thank you.

916
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,920
Wait right here, okay?

917
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,760
I'll be right back. Wait right here.

918
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,400
One second.

919
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,720
Hey!

920
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,640
Tell me what's going on.

921
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,480
- Now!
- All right.

922
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,800
Ben, you need to go home.

923
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,960
Do you know they keep a full history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

924
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,880
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.

925
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,200
- Just keep your voice down.
- No. What you are doing is a crime!

926
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,920
You are impersonating
a federal officer. It's a felony!

927
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,320
All right. Listen.

928
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,960
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?

929
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,320
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.

930
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,560
There's a coffee shop
near where i'm staying.

931
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,320
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- where are you staying, tim?

932
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,080
Tell me, because i don't know
where my brother lives!

933
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,920
A motel. Five blocks from here.

934
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,400
We'll sit down tomorrow morning,
i guarantee it.

935
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,360
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.

936
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,520
Here it is. Here. Here.

937
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,800
Just go home.

938
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,160
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

939
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,600
Tim, tim, tim,
why are you even here?

940
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,480
Tell me, who is emily posa?

941
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,240
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

942
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,960
Look, give me your car keys.

943
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,240
I'm not going anywhere.

944
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,960
I'm gonna be right here.

945
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,400
So you remember i love you and...

946
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,240
tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

947
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,280
I didn't realize how late it was and...

948
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,920
i have a really long drive,
so i need to go.

949
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,600
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

950
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,040
I don't wanna... wait, emily.

951
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,680
Do you wanna play a game?

952
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,000
What game?

953
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,960
The "what if" game.

954
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,160
The "what if" game.

955
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,520
What if...

956
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,200
...my pager goes off...

957
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,160
...and it's a heart...

958
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,280
...and...

959
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,000
...it works?

960
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,320
And my body doesn't reject it?

961
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,520
And...

962
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,320
...what if i have time?

963
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,600
What if?

964
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:51,160
What if we have children?

965
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,040
What if we got married?

966
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,640
I love you.

967
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,240
- I love you too.
- I love you.

968
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,560
Hi.

969
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,920
Is dr. Briar on duty tonight?

970
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,240
She's doing her rounds.

971
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,200
Can you tell her it's ben thomas?

972
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,920
It's very important.

973
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,400
- I'il... i'll page her.
- Thank you.

974
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,440
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

975
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,520
Hey.

976
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,560
- Is it emily?
- No, no.

977
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,800
I'm sorry.

978
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,120
It's...

979
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,160
is there?

980
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,960
I'm sorry.

981
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:21,720
Do you have any more optimism...

982
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,480
...about emily...

983
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,400
...than you did the other day?

984
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,520
Ben...

985
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,520
...when you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type...

986
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,480
...the odds go way down.

987
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,640
To what?

988
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,640
They go down. What's the...?

989
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
Give me a percentage.

990
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,800
Give me a number.

991
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,040
Three, 5 percent.

992
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:55,680
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

993
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,280
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I do.

994
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,480
Hello?

995
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,720
Dan.

996
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,360
It's time.

997
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,640
I love you.

998
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,120
1:38 a.m.

999
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,440
Hello?

1000
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,480
Ezra.

1001
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,200
My name is ben thomas.

1002
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,920
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.

1003
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:12,320
I do remember.

1004
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,480
I wanna apologize for being
so cruel to you...

1005
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,040
...but i had to be certain.

1006
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:22,480
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

1007
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:26,200
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?

1008
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,400
I wanna give you a gift.

1009
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:34,200
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named dan morris.

1010
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,320
You can trust him.

1011
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,840
Was that you at the diner?

1012
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,880
Goodbye.

1013
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,520
911 emergency.

1014
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,720
I need an ambulance.

1015
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,480
I have you at 9212 west third street
in los angeles.

1016
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,680
Yes, room number 2.

1017
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,560
What's the emergency?

1018
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,200
There's been a suicide.

1019
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,200
Who's the victim?

1020
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,520
I am.

1021
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,120
You are gonna need to stop
looking at that thing so much.

1022
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,000
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1023
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,800
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1024
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,720
I bet you did.

1025
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,520
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know. No more. No more work.

1026
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,360
I'm done. Almost done. Almost done.

1027
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,080
Tim!

1028
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,440
I have procedures.

1029
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,120
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she will die.

1030
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,040
- Ben?
- One, two, three.

1031
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,320
Hey.

1032
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,800
How you doing?

1033
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,320
About a year after the accident,
i got sick.

1034
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:53,040
I got lung cancer,
and i needed a double-iobe transplant.

1035
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,400
Tim could only give me one,
of course.

1036
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,080
It must have planted a seed,
because he...

1037
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,720
about six months later...

1038
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:10,120
...he donated the right part of his
liver to this woman.

1039
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,520
Her name is holly.

1040
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:00,440
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1041
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,320
Good job. Good job.

1042
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,520
- Ezra.
- Yeah.

1043
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,120
Hi.

1044
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,760
Are you a parent?

1045
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,280
No.

1046
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:17,000
Have we met?

1047
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,000
You okay?

1048
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,640
You must be emily.

1049
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,320
Yes.

1050
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,080
It's so nice to meet you.
