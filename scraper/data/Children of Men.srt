1
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,200
Day 1,000 of the siege of Seattle.

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,918
The Muslim community demands an end

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,836
to the Army's occupation of mosques.

4
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:42,922
The Homeland Security bill is ratified.

5
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:46,050
After eight years,
British borders will remain closed.

6
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,055
The deportation of illegal immigrants will continue.
	Good morning. Our lead story.

7
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:54,496
The world was stunned today
by the death of Diego Ricardo,

8
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:57,207
the youngest person on the planet.

9
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:03,046
Baby Diego was stabbed outside a bar in Buenos Aires
after refusing to sign an autograph.

10
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,653
Witnesses at the scene say...
Excuse me.

11
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:09,303
...that Diego spat in the face of a fan
who asked for an autograph.

12
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,952
He was killed in the ensuing brawl.
The fan was later beaten to death...

13
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:15,663
Coffee, please. Black.
...by the angry crowd.

14
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:20,355
Born in 2009,
the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo,

15
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:23,066
a working-class couple from Mendoza,

16
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:26,507
he struggled all his life
with the celebrity status

17
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:29,739
thrust upon him
as the world's youngest person.

18
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,186
Diego Ricardo,
the youngest person on the planet

19
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:41,314
was 18 years, 4 months,

20
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:46,214
20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.

21
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:10,048
Throughout his life,
Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder

22
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:14,324
of the 18 years of infertility
that humanity has endured

23
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:17,869
and its effect upon the world we now live in.

24
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:22,665
It seems that the mantle of the world's
youngest human has passed to
a woman.

25
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:26,105
She is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old.

26
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,632
- Faron.
- Mr. Griffiths.

27
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:37,784
I seem to be more affected
by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir.

28
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:42,268
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if I could finish my day's work at home.

29
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:45,604
...generation needs
to reject family and society.

30
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:12,403
- He's my dentist.
- She's my house cleaner.

31
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:16,886
- He's the waiter.
- She's my cousin.
They are illegal immigrants.

32
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:20,535
To hire, feed or shelter
illegal immigrants is a crime.

33
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,170
It's your life.

34
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:33,986
It's your choice.

35
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,618
Hey, amigo!

36
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:02,869
Jasper!

37
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:06,727
Good to see you. Come on.

38
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,861
You know who did it?
Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows.

39
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,738
I'll bet it was the government.

40
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:20,909
Every time one of our politicians
is in trouble, a bomb explodes.

41
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,410
It's the second time in a month.

42
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:27,582
- You okay?
- It was horrible.

43
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:30,813
I'm glad you don't take
cream or sugar, amigo.

44
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:35,924
Losing you and Baby Diego
on the same day would be too hard to bear.

45
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,009
Well, that was even worse,
everybody crying.

46
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,554
I mean, Baby Diego, come on.
That guy was a wanker.

47
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:45,412
Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker
on Earth.

48
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,539
Pull my finger. Quick, quick!
Jasper...

49
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,876
Fucking hell! That's disgusting!

50
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:57,507
Illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill.

51
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:03,868
Poor fugees.
After escaping the worst atrocities
and finally making
it to England,

52
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,204
our government hunts them down
like cockroaches.

53
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,784
- Any girls?
- No.

54
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:28,372
What about the one we had lunch with?
Lauren?
Lorna. That was ages ago.

55
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:32,647
- I liked her. What happened?
- She decided to renounce.

56
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:36,401
Renouncers? Are those the ones
that kneel down for a month for salvation?

57
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:38,278
No. They're the Repenters.

58
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:43,283
The Renouncers flagellate themselves for the forgiveness 
of humanity.  Oh, right.

59
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,514
Dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo?

60
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,857
- What'd you do on your birthday?
- Nothing.

61
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:58,506
Come on. You must've done something.
No. Same as every other day.

62
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:04,033
Woke up, felt like shit,went to work, felt like shit.
      That's called a hangover, amigo.

63
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:07,056
At least with a hangover, I feel something.

64
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,871
Honestly, Jasper, sometimes...

65
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,417
You could always come and live with us.

66
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:17,795
Yeah, but if I did that,
I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

67
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,840
Look who it is. It's Theo.
- Hey, Janice, how you doing? - It's Theo.

68
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,133
Your rebel with a lost cause.

69
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,286
She loves this color.

70
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,788
Don't you, darling? You love it.

71
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,803
"Is there a chance it will not work for me?

72
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:11,913
"There have been no cases of anyone surviving
who has taken the preparation. "

73
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:16,709
Daddy government hands out suicide kits
and anti-depressants in the rations,

74
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,898
but ganja is still illegal.

75
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,340
Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.

76
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,345
This bloke buys it from me and smuggles it in.
Guess what he does? His real job?

77
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,431
Immigration cop.

78
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:30,576
Bravo!

79
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:36,520
One of the many perks of having
a refugee camp in the neighborhood.

80
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,587
Come on, taste that.

81
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,990
Cough.

82
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,805
- Cough?
- Cough.

83
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,147
You taste it? Strawberries.

84
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,275
This is Strawberry Cough.

85
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,342
So, Human Project is having this dinner

86
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:08,011
and all the wisest men
in the world are there...

87
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,451
"Human Project. "
Why do people believe this crap?

88
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,040
You know, even if these people existed
with these facilities in secret locations...

89
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,021
Fuck me, that's strong.

90
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:21,983
Even if they discovered
the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.

91
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,485
Too late. The world went to shit.

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,385
You know what?
It was too late before the infertility thing
happened, for fuck's sake.

93
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:34,286
I was just trying to tell a joke, man.

94
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,311
I'm sorry. Go on.

95
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,188
- No, I'm not telling it now.
- No, come on, Jasper.

96
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,690
- No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you.
- It's all right. Go on.

97
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,444
Okay. The Human Project
gives this great big dinner

98
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:48,051
for all the scientists and sages in the world.

99
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:51,492
They're tossing around theories
about the ultimate mystery,

100
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:56,393
why are women infertile?
Why can't we make babies anymore?

101
00:09:56,393 --> 00:10:02,649
Some of them say it's genetic experiments,
gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old.

102
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,985
Anyway, in the corner,
this Englishman's sitting.

103
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:10,782
He hasn't said a word.He's just tucking into 
his dinner.So they decide to ask him.

104
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:15,161
They say, "Well, why do you think
we can't make babies anymore?"

105
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:19,019
And he looks up at them,
and he's chewing on this great big wing,

106
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,356
and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea,"
he said.

107
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,379
"But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?"

108
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,924
Eating a fucking stork.

109
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:31,114
Eating the stork.

110
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:34,659
Italia.

111
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,542
You okay, amigo?

112
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:45,817
Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier.

113
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,570
Well, a little Zen music
won't bother you, then, will it?

114
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:15,429
Good morning.
The time is 7:59 a. m.

115
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:42,435
British citizens, hold out your I.D. cards.
All others, follow instructions.

116
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,924
What the fuck?
Move along! Move along!

117
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:16,740
This is him.

118
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,329
- Get your fucking head down!
- Walk!

119
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:24,353
- Get your fucking head down!
- Okay. Okay.

120
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:27,898
- Get in!
- Get him in! Get him in!
Get his fucking legs.

121
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,461
Go, go, go, go!

122
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,178
You are under the jurisdiction
of the Fishes.

123
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:39,055
The Fishes are at war
with the British government

124
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,558
until they recognize equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain.

125
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:46,250
We're not gonna hurt you. We just want to talk.
But don't do anything stupid.

126
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,169
- Uncover him.
- It isn't safe.
Do it.

127
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,975
Hello, Theo.

128
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,042
It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

129
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:19,825
You scared the shit out of me.I'm sorry about the 
theatrics,but we had no choice.

130
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:23,996
The police have been a pain in the ass lately.
How have you been?

131
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:26,602
Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

132
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:29,626
Cut the lights.

133
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:41,826
The police keep using
that old photo of you in the posters.

134
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,495
It doesn't do you justice.

135
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:46,727
What do the police know about justice?
What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

136
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,438
The Fishes fight for equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain!

137
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,585
He knows what we do.

138
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:52,358
I know you almost blew me up
in a coffee shop yesterday.

139
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,609
My ears are still ringing.

140
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:54,965
- We don't bomb.
- That was the government.

141
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,216
That's what they do to spread the fear.

142
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:59,031
What about Liverpool?
After Liverpool,we stopped bombing.

143
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:03,618
We started speaking to the people.
And they're joining us, Theo. British people, too.

144
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:08,728
I don't talk politics.- That's all you ever used to do.
- That was 20 years ago.

145
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,795
I'm a lot more successful now.
Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

146
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:16,026
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on!

147
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:26,141
- You're smoking?
- Yeah. It's not working.

148
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:29,582
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

149
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,877
Were your parents in New York
when it happened?

150
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,858
- Yeah.
- Shit.

151
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,924
Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now,
isn't it?

152
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:41,782
Why am I here, Jules?
I need your help. I need transit papers.

153
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,389
Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

154
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,517
Need to get her to the coast,
past security checkpoints.

155
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:51,271
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years
and you come asking me for transit papers?

156
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:54,085
- Can you do it?
- I don't see how.

157
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,755
You could ask your cousin.

158
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:59,613
The government finances his
Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.

159
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:04,929
- Yeah, but he'd never do it.- He would if you asked him.
I can't.It's too dangerous.

160
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,395
I can get you £5,000.
I know you need the money.

161
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,567
What are you talking about?

162
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,007
- I don't fucking need your money.
- Right. Sorry.

163
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,405
My mistake.

164
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,998
You know that ringing in your ears? That...

165
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:36,943
That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
Like their swan song.

166
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:42,364
Once it's gone,you'll never hear that 
frequency again. Enjoy it while it lasts.

167
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:50,081
This never fucking happened,so don't go 
telling tales,'cause we'll be watching you.

168
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,688
At work, when you sleep,

169
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:57,276
when you have a piss, we'll be watching.
All the fucking time.

170
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,360
Jeez, your breath stinks.

171
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,593
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

172
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:06,139
It was Julian's idea bringing you here.
She put herself at great risk.

173
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,684
Now you know about the five grand we can offer you.
So if you change your mind,

174
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:13,749
pin this to the notice board at Camden tube.
We'll do the rest.

175
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,153
Here you are. Bus fare.

176
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,819
Earthquakes! Pollution!

177
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,113
Disease and famine!

178
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:07,032
Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!

179
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:12,767
And in his anger he has taken away
his most precious gift to us!

180
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:53,329
Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you.
This way, sir.

181
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:57,707
I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.
You got something in your teeth.

182
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,926
If you'll excuse me.

183
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,700
Couldn't save La Pietà.
Smashed up before we got there.

184
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,663
Pretty rummy, huh?

185
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:38,582
My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.

186
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,876
It was a lamp.

187
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:43,795
Good to see you, Theo.

188
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:51,617
We got to keep Las Meninas
and a few other Velásquezes,

189
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:55,892
but we only got a hold of two Goyas.
That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.

190
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,811
Not to mention people.
How's Martha?

191
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:02,356
She's doing her animal charity thing.
Sends her love.

192
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,692
- Give her my best.
- Yes.

193
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,844
Why did you come, Theo?

194
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:16,745
Well, the thing is,

195
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,020
I met this girl.
Cute?

196
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,898
Beautiful.

197
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,775
Is it serious?

198
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:25,921
Very.

199
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:32,387
She's got this brother in Brighton and
she hasn't seen him for about five years,

200
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,681
and he's not doing too good.

201
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,869
I mean, pretty sick.

202
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,980
- I don't think he's gonna make it.
- Sorry.

203
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,419
I've got money.
I was just hoping that you might...

204
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:01,791
I was hoping you could get us
the transit papers to get to the coast.

205
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,649
- Transit papers? That's quite a favor.
- I know.

206
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,421
Highly controlled.

207
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:12,530
Alex, take your pills.

208
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:14,928
Alex.

209
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:17,849
Alex?

210
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,995
Alex!

211
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,488
Come with me.

212
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,518
I'm really sorry, Nigel.
I just don't know who else to ask.

213
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,498
I'll see what I can do.

214
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:47,566
What?

215
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,025
You kill me.

216
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:54,343
A hundred years from now,
there won't be one sad fuck
to look at any of this.

217
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,262
What keeps you going?

218
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:02,267
You know what it is, Theo?
I just don't think about it.

219
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:14,571
- Where's Julian?
- She couldn't make it. Sends her best.

220
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,306
Here's a photo of the girl and her name.
Hang on. We got a problem.

221
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:26,876
All I could get were joint transit papers,
which means I would have to escort the girl.

222
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,126
Will you?

223
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,150
For a couple more grand.

224
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,989
Julian thinks very highly of you.
Does she?

225
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,075
Yeah.

226
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,369
Thanks again.

227
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:05,352
Go on, stay with her.

228
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:09,001
Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!

229
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,380
Have you seen this dog?

230
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,082
I'll be one minute.

231
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,941
Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.

232
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:36,528
Okay, Theo. He'll see to you.
He'll see to you.
I'm in a rush. Come
on. Come on.

233
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:38,926
That's 70 quid.

234
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,610
Shit.

235
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:06,976
- She's my house cleaner.
- He's the plumber.
Jesus.

236
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:10,625
- He's my dentist.
- He's the waiter.She's my cousin.

237
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:16,882
        They are illegal immigrants.
To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.

238
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:19,802
Protect Britain.
Report all illegal immigrants.

239
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:23,346
Did you get the papers?
Lovely to see you, too.

240
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,578
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

241
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:32,314
Just like the old days, back of the bus.
Yeah, except we're the old farts now.

242
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:35,754
- You're looking good.
- Right. Seriously. Look at me.

243
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,072
It's hard for me to look at you.

244
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,262
He had your eyes.

245
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:55,254
You know, I never understood how you got over it 
so quickly.You think I got over it?

246
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,756
No one could get over it.
I live with it. I think about him every day.

247
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,008
Come on, I mean the way you just...

248
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:00,884
You don't have a monopoly on suffering,
you know.

249
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,553
You always carried his memory
like a ball and chain...

250
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:03,908
What do you fucking know
about my memories?

251
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,828
- You don't know what I feel or what...
- Move!Yeah, there you go.

252
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:10,790
That's what you always do.
When it gets tough, you walk away.

253
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,457
This is our stop.

254
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,326
Thelonius!

255
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,753
So why did you come to me?

256
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,446
You could have found other ways
to get transit papers.
Probably.

257
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,739
- So why me?
- I trust you.

258
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,745
- And what happens after?
- You take a train back. It'll be safer.

259
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:51,142
No, I mean what happens to us?

260
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,540
I don't know.

261
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,215
Theo, come on. You came for the money.

262
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,465
Did I?

263
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:15,646
Theo?

264
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,922
- You got my money?
- See?

265
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:23,050
We'll take you down to the first checkpoint
on the Canterbury Road,

266
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,551
then you and Kee are on your own.

267
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:33,164
Well, this is obviously the elite unit.
- This is Miriam.- Hi.

268
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,500
- Is this the girl?
- Kee, this is Theo.

269
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:43,174
What the fuck you staring at?
Apparently the pleasure's all mine.

270
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,571
Are we planning a sing-along?

271
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,430
Good. I'm gonna take a nap.

272
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,943
The afternoon
is looking good here on Radio Avalon.

273
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,550
And now one for all the nostalgics
out there,

274
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,782
a blast from the past
all the way back from 2003.

275
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:13,099
That beautiful time when people refused to accept
the future was just around the corner.

276
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,603
Hey.

277
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:17,166
You're snoring.

278
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:21,128
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were. He always snored.

279
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,778
Where are we?

280
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:27,280
Canterbury. We're close.

281
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:31,869
Anyone know
if there's a hotel around here?

282
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,015
What?

283
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:37,707
Julian promised me a little bit of action.
You still like it in the afternoon?

284
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,609
So what did you do? Rob a train?
Blow up a building?

285
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:44,798
Leave the girl alone.

286
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,614
You told me he was suave.
Wanker's a drunk.

287
00:26:47,614 --> 00:26:51,368
He's suave. You should have seen him
in the old days when he was a real activist.

288
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,766
You were the activist,
I just wanted to get laid.

289
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:56,581
One time the police came
to throw us out of our squat

290
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:02,107
and Theo invited them up for coffee to negotiate,
only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.

291
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:04,609
No! You didn't, did you?

292
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:08,468
Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.

293
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,136
You know how many people
I've tried this with?

294
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:11,179
I don't wanna know.

295
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,430
You'll be happy to know
out of the hundreds...

296
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,099
- Hundreds?
- ... you are still the only one.

297
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,350
- I'm not doing it.
- Yes, you are.

298
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,520
- No, I'm not. The car's moving too much.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.You are. Ready?

299
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,482
Thelonius!

300
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,506
No, wait, wait. Okay.

301
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,198
Do it again! Do it again!

302
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,639
Julian, that's disgusting!

303
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:39,749
Look out!

304
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:41,313
Jesus! Shit!

305
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:43,712
Go! Go! We're gonna make it.
Come on, we're gonna make it.

306
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:47,047
No, I'm not gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it!

307
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:51,948
- Christ!
- Back up! Back up now! Jesus!

308
00:27:56,745 --> 00:28:00,395
Oh, save us!
Save us in our hour of need!

309
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,313
Blessed Mary, save us.

310
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,477
Christ, Jesus!- He's got a gun!
- Cover Kee!

311
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:20,727
Get down!

312
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:27,400
Oh, my God!
She's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot.

313
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,497
- How is she? How is she?
- She's bleeding!

314
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:42,519
She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!

315
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:47,525
Shit! Julian.

316
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,714
Put pressure on the wound!

317
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:55,346
Please, please, please.

318
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:58,057
Please, please.

319
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,203
Oh, no.

320
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,809
Oh, no.

321
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,939
Julian...

322
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,502
Jesus Christ!

323
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,005
Julian!

324
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:11,298
It's the cops. It's the cops.

325
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:14,739
Did they see us?

326
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,721
Keep going. Speed up.

327
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,868
Are they coming back?
What's happening?

328
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,995
Faster! Faster!- Are they coming back?
- I don't know. Just go faster!

329
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,228
Can't you pull off the road?

330
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,400
- All right, slow down. Slow down!
- I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.

331
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,798
- Stop the car.
- I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

332
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,593
Pull over to the side of the road.
Stop the car!
Get your passports
out!

333
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,410
Stay inside the vehicle!

334
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,808
We're British citizens!
We're British citizens!

335
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:42,268
- British citizens!
- Hands on the steering wheel!

336
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:45,292
Hands on the steering wheel!
Calm down. Tell me what happened!

337
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,168
We were attacked!
We gotta take her to a hospital.

338
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:50,400
Okay. Just wait.
I'm gonna call for assistance.

339
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,529
What are you doing? What are you doing?

340
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:57,074
- Get in the car.
- Why did you do that?
Get in the fucking car!

341
00:29:57,074 --> 00:30:01,453
Get back in now. Quickly.
We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.

342
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:04,164
Go! Go! Go!

343
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:48,062
We have to call on help now.
Put your hands out.

344
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,589
Fucking shit.May all the ascended beings,
the bodhisattvas and saints

345
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:57,968
and all those who have walked the surface
of the earth in the light of eternal truth,

346
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:01,825
come to the aid
of our beloved sister, Julian.

347
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:33,107
Theo! Come on!

348
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:48,330
Theo, come on!

349
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,669
This is Tomasz and Emily's farm.
I already called and told them the situation.

350
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,963
We'll be safe here.

351
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:45,471
Fishes are coming in
to vote for a new leader.

352
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:51,937
- Ian?
- Yeah.

353
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,918
- We have to convene.
- Everyone's arriving.

354
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,107
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's not my blood.

355
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,653
- Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee.
- Welcome.

356
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:00,904
Miriam.

357
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:04,762
They need to wash up and rest.
How about Julian's mate?

358
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:08,099
Yeah, can somebody
give me a lift back to London?

359
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,018
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
We'll sort it tomorrow.

360
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:13,104
Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.

361
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:16,752
Tomasz, don't block the car in.
It needs to be jump-started. Ian? Yeah.

362
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:20,610
They like you. And they don't like anyone.

363
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,537
- You did what you could.
- We need to show strength and unity.

364
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:55,125
- The shirt fit?- Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.
I'll take care of this.

365
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,774
As head Fishes,we need to make a choice now.
We need to choose leadership.

366
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:02,320
I don't think
that those bloodstains will wash off.

367
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,030
Don't worry about it. Throw it away.

368
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,936
- I'm in charge of watching you.
- Why?

369
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,395
They told me.

370
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:20,254
Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.

371
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:23,486
I lived there once. Didn't like it.

372
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:26,092
No.

373
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:30,263
They kill you.
Where you from?- Poland.

374
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:35,164
Is this your place?
My missus. She's a cod.

375
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,231
- English Fish.
- Mr. Faron.

376
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:44,237
Kee would like a word with you.
She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

377
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:45,800
I'll watch him.

378
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,411
Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

379
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,564
To Luke, our new leader. Luke.

380
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,336
- To Luke.
- Luke.

381
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:12,806
I'll be right outside.

382
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:21,564
You know what they do to these cows?
They cut off their tits. They do.

383
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:25,006
Gone. Bye.

384
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:28,134
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

385
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:32,721
It's wacko. Why not make machines
that suck eight titties?

386
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:38,979
Is that what you want to talk about?
Cows and titties? Julian told me about your baby.

387
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:41,481
Said his name was Dylan.

388
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:45,965
You taught him to swim when he was two.
He called you "Papa. "

389
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:49,197
She said if anything goes spooky,
I should talk to you.

390
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:52,221
Said you'd help me,
said you'd get me to the boat.

391
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:55,348
- What boat?- The Tomorrow.
The Tomorrow?

392
00:35:56,183 --> 00:36:00,771
I don't know what you're talking about.
But I'm sure your friends can take care of you.

393
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:03,169
But Julian said only trust you.

394
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:07,131
She said you'd help me.
I don't know why she said that.

395
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,469
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

396
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:13,075
- You can't leave.
- Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

397
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:14,951
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

398
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,601
What are you doing? Don't do that.

399
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:39,142
I'm scared.

400
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:46,441
Please help me.

401
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,741
Jesus Christ.

402
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:56,243
- Kee! Kee!
- What are you doing?

403
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:02,291
- Are you all right?
- She wanted him to know. She has the right.

404
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,272
Of course she has.

405
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:08,235
For God's sake.
When you're ready, come inside.
Everybody's arrived.

406
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:11,570
- She's pregnant.
- Now you know what's at stake.

407
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:18,348
- But she's pregnant.
- Yeah, I know.

408
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,893
It's a miracle, isn't it?

409
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:30,757
Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor
was killed today

410
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:33,468
in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.

411
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:37,325
Four other terrorists escaped
after murdering two officers.

412
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:41,497
Police say they have sufficient
forensic and surveillance evidence

413
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:43,374
to identify the four killers.

414
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:47,544
All suspects should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

415
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,673
This was broadcast an hour ago.

416
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:54,531
We have to assume it's just a matter of time
before they identify the rest of us,

417
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:57,346
which includes you, Theo.- Why is he here?
- He's not a Fish.

418
00:37:57,346 --> 00:38:01,413
- He's not one of us.- I want him here.
Kee wants him, he stays.

419
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:05,062
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

420
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,356
- Right.
- Now we got to reevaluate that position.

421
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:11,840
No, there's no need.
We move forward with the original plan.
Yes!

422
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,030
She'll never make it.
The police are looking for her.

423
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,992
We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.
We'd be risking the girl's life.

424
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:20,599
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

425
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,684
And this baby is the flag
that could unite us all!

426
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,187
We said we'd never use this baby
for political purposes.

427
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:28,419
My baby's not a flag.
Make it public!

428
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,775
What?

429
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,963
- What?
- What?
Excuse me?

430
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,031
You should make it public.

431
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:41,036
You saw the telly.
She's about to be very public.
It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

432
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:45,937
Oh, right. And then the government will say,
"We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too. "

433
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:47,084
Well, whatever is going on,

434
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:49,378
whatever your political ideas are,
it's irrelevant.

435
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,837
- It doesn't matter.
- Come on.

436
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:52,714
- She needs a doctor.
- You really don't get it.

437
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:54,904
Look, the government
will take her baby

438
00:38:54,904 --> 00:38:56,989
and parade a posh black English lady
as the mother.

439
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,971
- And she'll never see it again.
- Nobody's taking my baby!

440
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:01,056
We all know this government
would never acknowledge

441
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:04,393
the first human birth in 18 years
from a fugee.
A wanted fugee.

442
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:07,521
Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron
what they do to immigrants in this
country?

443
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:12,317
He knows. He's seen the cages.He's not that stupid.
I'm not going to the government.

444
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,403
You told me
you would get me to the Human Project.

445
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:17,321
- You promised me.
- I know.
And we will.

446
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:22,327
But I don't think it's safe
to try and reach the coast now.

447
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:26,810
You could stay here, Kee.
It's a safe place for you to have your child.

448
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,792
And when you and the baby
are well enough,

449
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:32,233
we will find a way
to get you to the Human Project.
I promise you, Kee.

450
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:36,090
It could take months
to get back in touch with them again.

451
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:43,285
This is true.We have to take it under 
consideration. Kee, this is your decision.

452
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:47,247
What do you think?

453
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:53,609
- I think you need proper care.
- Oh, brilliant!She has proper care!

454
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,050
- What the fuck does he know?
- Hang on. Kee?

455
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,134
Kee, this is your choice.

456
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:05,287
- I have my baby here...
- Yes!
...then you get me to the Human Project.

457
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:07,789
Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

458
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,918
We need to organize safe houses.
No more than three days in one place.

459
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:13,523
No, no,
you can't keep moving her around.
It's for her safety.

460
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:37,715
- Please help him!
- What are you doing?

461
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:39,592
- He's hurt really badly!
- Oh, shit, fuck.

462
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:42,095
- I didn't have anywhere else to go.
- You're not supposed to be here!

463
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:43,242
There's fucking police everywhere!

464
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:45,744
- What do you think you're doing?
- He's been bleeding for hours!

465
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:48,975
Shut up! Get his bike out of here.
Get it out!

466
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:06,077
What was I supposed to do?
It's a simple fucking plan.
Get in here,Patric!

467
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:10,978
What the fuck are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
No fucking excuses!

468
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:13,584
- You have a first aid kit? Medicine?
- Mostly for cows.

469
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:16,713
lodine, bandages, clean towels,
whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

470
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:18,485
And for God's sake,
hide the fucking motorcycle.

471
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:20,988
- You put everything at risk.
- What was I supposed to do?

472
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:25,471
What about all the fucking police, Ian?
You said it would be safe!

473
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:29,015
We paid the gang.
We had no idea about the cops.

474
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,131
You broke the protocol.What were you thinking?
What was I thinking?

475
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:41,529
You could be responsible
for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

476
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:44,449
He needs a proper doctor!
Don't you get it?

477
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:49,037
We have a baby.When people see we have a baby,
everyone will join us in the Uprising.

478
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:52,477
But we can forget about the baby
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

479
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:56,753
What was I supposed to do?
You saw how he is.
He's on death's fucking door!

480
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:59,671
- Take it easy.
- You broke protocol.
He's my fucking cousin!

481
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:03,426
Luke, he needs a doctor.

482
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:06,867
Don't worry. We'll take care of him.
Simon, right?

483
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:10,204
- Aye, Simon.
- All right, sit down, Patric.

484
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,602
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

485
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:16,251
Be proud to know that because
of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

486
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:18,440
The baby will stay with us.

487
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:22,820
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

488
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,740
No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then,
after we move the girl.

489
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,223
Patric, you ever break protocol again,

490
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,768
I'll have to kill you.

491
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:47,950
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

492
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,722
- Listen to me.
- What's going on?

493
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:54,310
Luke killed Julian.
They want your baby. They killed Julian.

494
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,813
They're gonna...
They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

495
00:42:56,813 --> 00:43:00,358
We have to leave. We have to go now.
Miriam, shut up!

496
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:02,860
Trust me, we've got to go.

497
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,363
Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

498
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:06,823
Get off!

499
00:43:06,823 --> 00:43:10,471
I'm going with him.
Miriam, you can stay if you want.

500
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:17,353
Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut.
- I mean it.- All right.-All right.

501
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,961
We're moving the girl
to Bristol straight away.

502
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,653
We need to bring weapons over...

503
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:50,303
The refugee camps...

504
00:43:56,873 --> 00:43:59,584
Zaphyr, he looks bloody fucking awful.
Yeah. Really?

505
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:02,921
All that dirt and sand in there,
nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

506
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:05,632
Shit! It's fucking disgusting.
He's not gonna make it.

507
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:10,010
Of course not gonna make it,
with all the blood and guts coming out.

508
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,765
Hey, Samir.

509
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:51,094
Shit.

510
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:08,404
Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!
Don't shoot!

511
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:11,428
Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

512
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:13,409
- Stop!
- The girl's in the car!

513
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:18,100
Stop the fucking car!Give me the fucking keys.
Give me the fucking keys.

514
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:21,125
Get down! Get down!

515
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:25,921
Can't you get it moving any faster?
For God's sake! Come on. Come on.

516
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:29,466
Stop!

517
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:30,717
Shit.

518
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:34,053
They're coming! They're coming!

519
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:37,703
Get going, get going!
They're getting closer!

520
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:44,689
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

521
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:48,234
Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

522
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,111
Fuck off!

523
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:05,126
Miriam, jump-start the car!
We have to go!

524
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:16,075
Wait till it gets faster!
All right! All right! Just push, you push!

525
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,250
Fucking hell!

526
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:29,110
Miriam! Miriam!

527
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,507
We have to wait for him! Theo!

528
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:34,948
Go, go, go!

529
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,277
- Kee, are you all right? - I'm fine.
We need to find a safe house.

530
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:53,613
Yeah, the last one was really fucking safe.
Well, what do you suggest?

531
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:56,115
Don't worry. I know where to go.

532
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:22,808
Wait here.

533
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,292
Oh, fuck.

534
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,042
Fuck.

535
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,151
Jasper?

536
00:47:54,195 --> 00:47:55,341
Janice?

537
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:12,858
Jasper?

538
00:48:18,907 --> 00:48:21,617
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck you.

539
00:48:22,452 --> 00:48:29,230
What are you doing with this shit?
This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.

540
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,818
It's not bullshit what they say.
They pass away quite peacefully.

541
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:34,964
Jasper.

542
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:37,779
Meet Miriam and Kee.

543
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:52,691
The Tomorrow is a hospital ship
disguised as a fishing boat.

544
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:57,591
They'll take us to the Human Project.
I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real.

545
00:48:57,591 --> 00:48:59,990
Yeah, but you're also the guy
that believes in UFOs.

546
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:04,055
Tell them about that thing
you saw on the heath.You saw a UFO?

547
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,331
Did you know that the Human Project

548
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:10,521
is supposed to have
a community on the Azores?

549
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:15,422
It's a sanctuary.That's where they'll take us, 
Kee. Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

550
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:20,531
It's going to stop at the last two
weather buoys en route at sunset.

551
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:24,493
So it will be tonight at Windsmore
and then two night's time at Bexhill.

552
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:26,787
You can forget about Windsmore.
We'd never make it in time.

553
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:28,768
No, it's our only chance.
We can't get to Bexhill.

554
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:32,209
That's a refugee camp.
Eureka! Eat and rest.

555
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:36,067
With a little bit of luck,
you're going to need all your energy.

556
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:39,508
- Where are you going?
- Feed her for me, Theo.

557
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:42,636
Kee, your baby is the miracle

558
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:45,346
the whole world has been waiting for.

559
00:49:46,703 --> 00:49:49,100
Come on. Come on.

560
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:53,897
Did he really see a UFO?

561
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:38,212
Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

562
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:45,511
She's doing something.
She smited me with that.
Said it was good for my baby.

563
00:50:47,597 --> 00:50:50,307
Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

564
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,876
Earnest.

565
00:50:58,233 --> 00:50:59,587
Yeah.

566
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,489
- How many months?
- Eight.

567
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:06,470
It takes nine months.

568
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,616
I know.

569
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,223
Who's the father?

570
00:51:11,475 --> 00:51:13,978
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

571
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:15,332
Sorry?

572
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:23,049
That'd be wicked, eh?
Yeah, it would.

573
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:26,594
Fuck knows.
I don't know most of the wankers' names.

574
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,078
You know, when I started puking,
I thought I catch the pest.

575
00:51:31,078 --> 00:51:33,893
But then my belly started getting big.

576
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:39,420
Nobody ever told me these things.
I never seen a pregnant woman before.

577
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,774
But I knew.

578
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,904
I felt like a freak.

579
00:51:43,904 --> 00:51:45,779
I didn't tell nobody.

580
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:51,620
I thought about the Quietus thing.
Supposed to be suave.

581
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,808
Pretty music and all that.

582
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:58,188
Then the baby kicked.

583
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,611
I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
And I feel it. And me, too.

584
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,174
I am alive.

585
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:13,098
- Froley.
- Froley.

586
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:16,957
Name my baby Froley.

587
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,607
It's the first baby in 18 years.

588
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,508
- You can't call it Froley.
- Says who?
Kee, I've found you a boat.

589
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:26,655
- Great.
- How?

590
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:28,949
We get ourselves arrested.
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, no.

591
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:33,015
Syd, this border guard I sell pot to,
has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

592
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:36,038
Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison!

593
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:40,313
Wicked.

594
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:16,287
"Froley. "

595
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:19,728
Come on.

596
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:30,468
Everything is a mythical
cosmic battle

597
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,117
between faith and chance.

598
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:38,601
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- You already did. Take another one.

599
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,146
Now cough.

600
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:47,256
- What do you taste?
- Strawberries.

601
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:51,009
Strawberries? That's what it's called.
Strawberry Cough.

602
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:52,783
Wicked.

603
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:57,162
So, you've got faith over here, right,
and chance over there.

604
00:53:57,162 --> 00:54:01,124
- Like yin and yang.
- Sort of.
Or Shiva and Shakti.

605
00:54:01,124 --> 00:54:03,314
Lennon and McCartney.

606
00:54:03,314 --> 00:54:04,982
Look, Julian and Theo.

607
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:10,821
Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met
among a million protestors in a rally
by chance.

608
00:54:10,821 --> 00:54:13,533
But they were there
because of what they believed in

609
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:17,286
in the first place, their faith.
They wanted to change the world.

610
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:20,310
And their faith kept them together.

611
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,960
But by chance, Dylan was born.

612
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,628
This is him?

613
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:30,111
Yeah, that's him. He would have been
about your age. Magical child.

614
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:32,509
Beautiful.

615
00:54:33,344 --> 00:54:35,847
- Their faith put in praxis.
- Praxis?

616
00:54:35,847 --> 00:54:38,035
- What happened?
- Chance.

617
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:43,770
He was their sweet little dream.
He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

618
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:47,107
Little lungs.

619
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:51,903
And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic.

620
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:56,283
And then, by chance,

621
00:54:56,805 --> 00:54:59,098
- he was gone.
- Oh, Jesus.

622
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:03,582
You see, Theo's faith

623
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:06,501
lost out to chance.

624
00:55:07,753 --> 00:55:09,004
So,

625
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,635
why bother
if life's going to make its own choices?

626
00:55:14,635 --> 00:55:17,555
- Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
- Yeah.

627
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:22,768
Oh, boy. That's terrible.
But, you know,
everything happens for a reason.

628
00:55:22,768 --> 00:55:27,668
That I don't know.
But Theo and Julian would always
bring Dylan. He
loved it here.

629
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:46,229
It's the alarm! Someone's breaking in!
What is it?

630
00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:47,688
Look at this.

631
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:52,068
Shit.

632
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:02,078
Jasper, hurry up!

633
00:56:04,685 --> 00:56:05,937
Where's Janice?

634
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:09,378
Take the back path to the main road,
then follow the map I've given Miriam.

635
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:10,733
- Yeah, I've got it.
- What are you talking about?

636
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:14,278
Wait for Syd at the old school
on Watchbell Road in Rye.

637
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:16,364
Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig.

638
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:19,699
- We need to get Janice.
- We're not going, Theo.

639
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:23,663
- What are you talking about?
- You don't need an anchor.

640
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,478
- No, Jasper. You're coming.
- You need time. We'll stall them.

641
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:30,439
I'll send them the wrong way.
It's the best idea. Go on. Go on. Jasper.

642
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:35,237
Theo, I've talked my way out of
worse things than this. Believe me.

643
00:56:35,237 --> 00:56:36,800
Go on. Go.

644
00:56:38,782 --> 00:56:42,952
And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig.

645
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,224
I love you.

646
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:18,464
Hey, amigos!

647
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:24,200
We're looking for Theo Faron.
We know he was here a few weeks ago.
Has he been back?

648
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,641
- Who?
- Theo Faron.
I haven't seen him in weeks.

649
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,456
There's biscuits and coffee on inside!
Help yourself.

650
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:34,313
You want a drag?
Come on, have a drag. Lighten up.

651
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:37,858
- What we got?
- Here, Luke.

652
00:58:38,902 --> 00:58:42,446
There's a dead woman and dog inside.
They're going to Bexhill.

653
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:45,157
When did they leave?

654
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:48,286
When did they leave?

655
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,979
Pull my finger, go on.

656
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,542
Pull my finger.

657
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:56,836
I'll do it.

658
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,969
Fuck you.

659
00:59:16,127 --> 00:59:17,690
Pull my finger.

660
00:59:23,947 --> 00:59:27,387
- Theo, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

661
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:33,123
You tell me the fucking reason in that.
- It's all part of a bigger thing.- Shut up!

662
00:59:33,123 --> 00:59:35,834
Shut up and get in the fucking car.

663
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,919
- Jasper?
- He's fine.

664
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:41,568
Everything's fine.

665
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,761
I was 31.
Midwife at the John Radcliffe.

666
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:53,888
I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.

667
01:01:54,515 --> 01:01:57,642
Three of my patients
miscarried in one week.

668
01:01:58,164 --> 01:02:03,690
Others were in their fifth and sixth month.
We managed to save two of the poor babies.

669
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,713
Next week, five more miscarried.

670
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:10,571
Then the miscarriages
started happening earlier.

671
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,118
I remember booking a woman in
for her next appointment

672
01:02:14,118 --> 01:02:19,226
and noticing that the page
seven months ahead was completely blank.
Not a single name.

673
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:23,189
I rang a friend
who was working at Queen Charlotte's,

674
01:02:23,189 --> 01:02:26,003
and she had no new pregnancies, either.

675
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:30,070
She then rang her sister in Sydney.

676
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:33,824
And it was the same thing there.

677
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:39,559
You can relax. She's finished.

678
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,441
As the sound of the playgrounds faded,

679
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,152
the despair set in.

680
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:58,015
Very odd what happens in a world
without children's voices.

681
01:03:00,622 --> 01:03:02,603
I was there at the end.

682
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:07,192
Now you're gonna be there at the beginning.

683
01:03:07,192 --> 01:03:08,337
Yeah.

684
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:11,361
I'll be there at the beginning.

685
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,655
Thank you.

686
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:20,537
Kee, come on! We've got to go!

687
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,155
Stop where you are.

688
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:35,135
I'm looking for Syd.

689
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,993
Hands above your head.

690
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:43,477
You're a fascist pig.

691
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,700
What did you say?

692
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,767
I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.

693
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,876
- Say it again.
- No, don't, please!

694
01:04:08,503 --> 01:04:09,962
Say it again.

695
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:12,151
Say it!

696
01:04:13,195 --> 01:04:15,071
You're a fascist pig.

697
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,185
Come on.

698
01:04:33,945 --> 01:04:37,594
It was Jasper's idea, you know.
The whole password thing.

699
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:41,347
He will piss himself laughing
when I tell him about this.

700
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:44,581
He's a cheeky old bastard.

701
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:46,875
So proud of his weed.

702
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:51,879
Syd could get it a lot cheaper from
the gangs, but Syd likes to deal
with Jasper.

703
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:55,215
Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.

704
01:04:56,363 --> 01:05:00,220
- All right.- What's wrong with her? 
Is she sick? Just carsick.

705
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:04,704
- She's not going to puke, is she?
- No. She's fine.
Puking's bad. Very, very bad.

706
01:05:05,226 --> 01:05:08,458
It doesn't wash out.
The smell never goes away.

707
01:05:09,189 --> 01:05:13,254
Usually, there's people trying
to get out of Bexhill, not in.

708
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:17,633
Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.

709
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:20,449
Syd doesn't want to know.

710
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,056
Syd doesn't care.

711
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,018
Just breathe. Just breathe.

712
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:31,502
What's wrong with her? A minor contraction.
It's normal. Just breathe.

713
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:33,797
All right.

714
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:37,967
When you're released,stroll out with the 
other fugees. Look for the statue of a soldier.

715
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,721
There you'll meet a woman, Marichka.
Arab, gypsy, something.

716
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:46,205
Always carries a shitty little dog with her.
She'll find you accommodation for tonight.

717
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:48,706
All right. You're fugees now.

718
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:52,044
Show Syd the fugee face.

719
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:53,712
Sad face.

720
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:55,380
Sad fugee face.

721
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:58,404
That's good. That's good.

722
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:00,697
Okay. Out!

723
01:06:05,391 --> 01:06:07,579
Come on. Come on. Come on.

724
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,731
Hurry up. Hurry up, move.

725
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:34,064
Send me a postcard.Seats in the back!
Come on, hurry up!

726
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,802
What time
are we supposed to meet the boat?
Sunset tomorrow.

727
01:07:23,802 --> 01:07:27,765
How do we know that Luke and his mob
haven't intercepted it?

728
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:32,247
Luke has no way of contacting
the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.

729
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:36,210
Say again?

730
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:42,570
Contact with the Human Project is done by 
mirrors. Julian was our mirror.

731
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:46,220
What do you mean, "mirrors"?

732
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:50,287
Mirrors. They contact one of our people.

733
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:55,188
That person contacts someone else,and so on, 
till word gets to Julian.She tells Luke.

734
01:07:55,188 --> 01:07:57,586
You mean you never
actually talked to any of them?

735
01:07:57,586 --> 01:08:01,757
Don't fucking tell me
you never actually talked to them?

736
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:06,240
- Breathe it out.- Is she okay?
That's it. Breathe it out, breathe it out.

737
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:09,577
I can't fucking breathe.

738
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:11,871
You sure this is normal?

739
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:14,582
It shouldn't be this frequent.

740
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:17,814
Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right.

741
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:45,864
Miriam,

742
01:08:45,864 --> 01:08:47,427
I'm all wet.

743
01:08:48,053 --> 01:08:52,224
Her water's broke. The baby's coming.
Shit. Shit!

744
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:56,604
All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart.
Everything is fine. Breathe.

745
01:08:56,604 --> 01:09:02,026
Just breathe it out. That's it.
Tomorrow you'll be safe.You'll be on the boat.

746
01:09:02,026 --> 01:09:07,030
On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you.
They'll take you far away
from all this.

747
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:20,272
Look up, you piece of shite. Look up.

748
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:22,880
Out!

749
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,444
Get out!

750
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:27,468
Lord, give Kee the strength to know
that she has the power already within her.

751
01:09:27,468 --> 01:09:29,136
- She has the wisdom...
- What's wrong with you?

752
01:09:29,136 --> 01:09:32,994
I said, what's wrong with you?
Look at me! I said, what's wrong with you?

753
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:36,018
- Saint Gabriel, help us...
- Shut up!

754
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:41,336
- You! Out!- Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!
Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!

755
01:09:41,336 --> 01:09:47,071
- Up, now. Come on.
- Caca! Caca!
Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.

756
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:51,970
You smell it yourself.
You fucking people disgust me.

757
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:04,901
She's okay, Kee. She's okay.

758
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,194
- She's gonna be...
- Miriam!

759
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:26,276
Move it! Come along now!

760
01:10:32,324 --> 01:10:37,747
Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!
Get down there. Down there. Move.

761
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:39,414
Follow the line!

762
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:45,358
- Theo!
- Kee!

763
01:10:45,358 --> 01:10:47,338
- Take it off!
- Theo!

764
01:10:52,032 --> 01:10:54,951
Come on, move! Move it! Come on!

765
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,932
Move it! Move it!

766
01:10:56,932 --> 01:10:59,331
Come on! Move! Move!

767
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:02,563
Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.

768
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:04,961
Do not support terrorists.

769
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:10,278
Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.
Do not support terrorists.

770
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,559
Hey you, buddy!
Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!

771
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:24,460
You want accommodations? I got running water! 
I got... Just leave the girl alone.

772
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,171
- Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
- Fuck off.

773
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:28,944
- Who do you fucking think you are?
- Fuck off.

774
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:30,925
Don't mind these bastards.
I'll take care of you.

775
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:33,427
Come on, I've got a room, food,
a place to stay. What do you need?

776
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:36,763
- I'm fine, thanks.- You must need something, man.
"Fuck off," is it? Bollocks.

777
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:49,797
Marichka?

778
01:12:01,476 --> 01:12:03,040
It's okay, Kee.

779
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,167
Just breathe through it.

780
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:10,755
That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee.

781
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:13,362
We're almost there.

782
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,690
It's just a few stairs.

783
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:31,609
Just hold onto me.

784
01:12:32,757 --> 01:12:34,633
I've got you.

785
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,136
Just keep breathing.

786
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:40,264
Marichka? How far?

787
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:42,455
How far?

788
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:45,269
We're almost there, Kee. Almost there.

789
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:48,606
You're doing great. Come on.

790
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:53,819
You're almost there. Three more steps.

791
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:05,810
We're there, Kee. We're there.

792
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:18,324
Okay, there's a bed. Easy.

793
01:13:19,576 --> 01:13:22,182
Make her go! Make her go!

794
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:27,918
That's great. Thank you.

795
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:31,462
Get her out!

796
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:39,908
Thank you.

797
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:53,777
Okay, Kee.

798
01:13:53,777 --> 01:13:57,425
I'm going to put my coat underneath.
You'll be cleaner.

799
01:14:01,389 --> 01:14:02,848
You're okay.

800
01:14:04,517 --> 01:14:06,081
Okay?

801
01:14:06,081 --> 01:14:09,312
There's water.
I'm just going to wash my hands.

802
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,507
- Theo! Theo!
- I'm here. Fuck!

803
01:14:17,134 --> 01:14:19,741
It's okay. Everything's okay.

804
01:14:19,741 --> 01:14:21,304
Do something!

805
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:29,125
It's looking good, Kee. It's looking good.

806
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:32,357
You're doing great. Just keep breathing.

807
01:14:32,357 --> 01:14:34,547
- Keep breathing.
- I am breathing!

808
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:39,342
No, like Miriam said. Do you remember?
Breathe out. Just think about
the out.

809
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:43,618
Breathe out and push. Push as well.

810
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:46,955
- That's it. That's it!
- I can't!

811
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:50,396
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Just out and push.

812
01:14:50,396 --> 01:14:52,063
Out and push.

813
01:14:53,316 --> 01:14:55,818
- That's it!
- I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please.

814
01:14:55,818 --> 01:14:59,155
Kee, I can see the head. I can see the head.

815
01:14:59,155 --> 01:15:03,429
You're doing great. You're doing great, Kee.
That's it. That's it.

816
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:09,478
It's coming again.
Just breathe out and push. Out and push.

817
01:15:09,478 --> 01:15:11,355
- That's it. Out and...
- I can't.

818
01:15:11,355 --> 01:15:13,649
- You can. Yes, you can.
- I fucking can't!

819
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:17,924
- Yes, you fucking can! Come on!- I can't do it.
Kee, the head's coming out.

820
01:15:17,924 --> 01:15:22,303
That's it, you're nearly there!
You're nearly there. Just push!

821
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:24,910
Push, Kee! Push!

822
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,264
Push!

823
01:15:34,607 --> 01:15:36,274
Oh, my God.

824
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:39,611
How is he?

825
01:15:40,759 --> 01:15:42,322
It's a girl.

826
01:15:44,096 --> 01:15:46,493
Kee, you've got a girl.

827
01:15:53,793 --> 01:15:55,460
Hey, baba.

828
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:07,868
- Aren't we supposed to cut the cord?
- Yeah, it's okay. There's no rush.

829
01:16:08,704 --> 01:16:10,267
You've done it.

830
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,082
Kee,

831
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,585
see?

832
01:16:16,524 --> 01:16:18,296
It wasn't that bad.

833
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:21,111
Oh, yeah, not for you.

834
01:16:38,838 --> 01:16:42,279
Come on! Hurry up!
We don't have much time!

835
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:43,947
Who is it?

836
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:47,804
The King of England.
Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd.

837
01:16:53,436 --> 01:16:56,459
How can you sleep through
when the whole city's going to hell?

838
01:16:56,981 --> 01:17:01,882
- What's wrong with her?
- She's fine. It's a woman's thing.
Fuck off!

839
01:17:01,882 --> 01:17:05,740
A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole
in the fence and fugees got out.

840
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:09,702
But Syd happens to know,
the hole in the fence
isn't about fugees getting out.

841
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:11,579
- It's about Fishies getting in.
- Go away.

842
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:15,124
Syd also happens to know that the Army's
gonna blow the shit out of this place.

843
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:19,817
But don't worry. Syd is here to get you out.
Fuck off. Go away. Go on. Piss off!

844
01:17:19,817 --> 01:17:21,692
Get your fucking dog.

845
01:17:28,054 --> 01:17:31,599
What you got there?
- Nothing.- Nothing?

846
01:17:31,599 --> 01:17:33,266
- Nothing.
- No?

847
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,333
- Like to show me?
- I don't have anything.

848
01:17:38,272 --> 01:17:42,442
- It's nothing.
- Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look.

849
01:17:43,799 --> 01:17:46,092
- It's nothing.
- Let me see.

850
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:50,471
- No.
- Let me see.
It's okay. Let me see.

851
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:53,704
Jesus Christ.

852
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:56,206
Jesus Christ.

853
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,648
- That's a...
- That's right.

854
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:01,315
We got a baby.

855
01:18:01,942 --> 01:18:05,590
And now we need a rowboat.
Can you help us?

856
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:10,179
Get her up. Get her up. We need to go.
Can you help us get a boat?

857
01:18:10,179 --> 01:18:14,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up.
We need to go. We need to go now.

858
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:18,104
- What's she saying?
- Fuck knows.Bad! Bad! Bad!

859
01:18:18,104 --> 01:18:20,918
- She doesn't want us to go.
- Shut up.

860
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,923
We need to go.

861
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:32,076
Syd was watching television last night
with Mommy.

862
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:36,039
She's a sweet old soul.
Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking.

863
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:39,897
And then the news came on,
and you two were on it.

864
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:42,191
Something about a cop killer.

865
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:44,796
Something about a big reward.

866
01:18:45,736 --> 01:18:48,864
Syd then finds out
the Fishes are looking for you.

867
01:18:48,864 --> 01:18:53,452
So Syd thinks,"If the Fishes are looking for you,
"and the coppers are looking for you,

868
01:18:53,452 --> 01:18:58,664
"you people are first class commodities. "
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

869
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,585
Down, down, down!

870
01:19:01,585 --> 01:19:04,086
Now, Syd has a baby.

871
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,519
Bad! Bad! Bad!

872
01:19:21,084 --> 01:19:22,334
Marichka!

873
01:19:23,273 --> 01:19:27,443
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

874
01:19:32,762 --> 01:19:34,429
Bitch. You bitch.

875
01:19:37,246 --> 01:19:40,894
Baby! Marichka baby!
Quick, quick. The baby!

876
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:45,691
My baby! She took...

877
01:19:46,839 --> 01:19:49,653
I'll fucking kill you, you gypsy bitch!

878
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,350
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

879
01:20:01,437 --> 01:20:03,312
Go, go!

880
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:22,081
Fuck! Shit.

881
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:30,945
How are you doing?

882
01:20:30,945 --> 01:20:35,219
- How are you?- It hurts.
Marichka, we need a boat.

883
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:39,807
A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat.

884
01:20:41,268 --> 01:20:42,935
We need a boat.

885
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:48,775
A fucking boat! A boat.

886
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:51,069
- A rowboat!
- Yes.

887
01:20:51,591 --> 01:20:52,945
Hurry.

888
01:20:53,468 --> 01:20:57,116
- You okay? Come on.
- Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

889
01:21:51,755 --> 01:21:53,110
It's okay.

890
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:39,406
Look at that, Theo. They love my baby.

891
01:22:42,952 --> 01:22:46,393
I want to call her Bazouka.
Bazouka?

892
01:22:46,393 --> 01:22:48,374
You don't like it?

893
01:22:48,374 --> 01:22:50,667
I was getting used to Froley.

894
01:22:51,294 --> 01:22:53,274
Froley's a man's name.

895
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:58,383
What is he thinking, giving you
a boy's name? You're a girl.

896
01:22:58,906 --> 01:23:02,764
We have a boat. Stay here.
In one hour, we go.

897
01:23:02,764 --> 01:23:04,014
Thanks.

898
01:23:04,536 --> 01:23:06,308
Human Project real?

899
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:08,811
It better be.

900
01:24:30,769 --> 01:24:34,418
Drop your gun! Drop your gun! Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands in the air!

901
01:24:34,418 --> 01:24:36,816
Okay, is clear! Is clear!

902
01:24:36,816 --> 01:24:38,902
Hands above your head
and fucking move that here.

903
01:24:38,902 --> 01:24:40,257
You killed my fucking cousin!

904
01:24:40,257 --> 01:24:44,324
Get on your knees!
On your knees, you fucking...
He was 19!

905
01:24:44,324 --> 01:24:45,991
Don't kill him!

906
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:48,285
Don't kill him!

907
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:50,996
Watch the flanks!

908
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:54,437
Kee. Thank God.

909
01:24:56,106 --> 01:24:59,129
You'll be safe now. How's the child?

910
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:09,036
You put their lives at risk. Just let her go.
You don't know what you're doing.

911
01:25:09,036 --> 01:25:11,851
No? Look around you.

912
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:16,231
It's the Uprising.
And they haven't even seen the baby.
Let's go.

913
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:18,002
No! Get off...

914
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:23,113
Not in front of the girl.Wait till we get 
around the corner.Then do them all.

915
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:24,364
Come on!

916
01:25:24,364 --> 01:25:26,658
Oh, lads

917
01:25:26,658 --> 01:25:29,264
You should have seen us gannin'

918
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:34,791
Passing the folks along the road
And all of them was starin'

919
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:39,586
And all the lads and lasses there
They all had smilin' faces

920
01:26:04,508 --> 01:26:05,654
Fuck!

921
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,527
Sorry. Sorry.

922
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:46,007
Move it! Get her inside!

923
01:26:47,572 --> 01:26:49,031
Faron!

924
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:03,003
Get her inside!Get her in the 
building now! Now! Move it! Now!

925
01:27:27,404 --> 01:27:29,279
Sarge, left flank!

926
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:31,991
Slug the fuckers!

927
01:27:34,807 --> 01:27:37,621
Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens!

928
01:28:52,176 --> 01:28:54,260
Go check the roof!

929
01:30:10,901 --> 01:30:13,715
I was carrying the baby up the stairs.

930
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:16,217
I started crying.

931
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:22,265
I'd forgotten what they looked like.
They're so beautiful.They're so tiny.

932
01:30:24,143 --> 01:30:25,916
Julian was wrong!

933
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:28,105
She thought it could be peaceful!

934
01:30:28,105 --> 01:30:32,589
But how can it be peaceful
when they try to take away your dignity?

935
01:30:32,589 --> 01:30:34,465
We need him, Theo!

936
01:30:35,091 --> 01:30:37,489
We need the baby. We need him!

937
01:30:40,514 --> 01:30:42,285
It's a girl, Luke.

938
01:30:45,519 --> 01:30:46,664
A girl?

939
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:50,731
I had a sister.

940
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,840
Theo! Theo!

941
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,235
You okay?

942
01:31:17,217 --> 01:31:18,571
How is she?

943
01:31:19,302 --> 01:31:20,657
Annoyed.

944
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:35,316
My God, the baby.

945
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:38,130
Move back! Fucking move back!

946
01:32:41,364 --> 01:32:44,909
Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing!

947
01:32:44,909 --> 01:32:50,330
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!

948
01:33:05,033 --> 01:33:07,952
We've got two coming through,
coming out.

949
01:34:05,615 --> 01:34:07,386
Second floor, left!

950
01:34:09,368 --> 01:34:10,723
Medic!

951
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:25,321
Marichka!

952
01:35:10,263 --> 01:35:12,869
No, Marichka no go. You go.

953
01:35:12,869 --> 01:35:15,788
- You go.
- Marichka, come. Marichka.

954
01:35:16,415 --> 01:35:19,333
- Marichka, get in the boat!
- Go, boat!

955
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,925
The buoy! Theo, the buoy!

956
01:36:39,519 --> 01:36:40,978
You okay?

957
01:36:40,978 --> 01:36:43,064
Yeah. You?

958
01:36:43,064 --> 01:36:44,314
Yeah.

959
01:36:48,694 --> 01:36:50,362
What a day.

960
01:36:51,718 --> 01:36:55,785
We're too late, aren't we?
No. No, we're fine.

961
01:36:55,785 --> 01:36:59,850
But they said they wouldn't wait.
Trust me. They'll come back.

962
01:37:14,345 --> 01:37:18,932
I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding!
- No, no, no, it's me.- I'm bleeding everywhere.

963
01:37:20,184 --> 01:37:22,373
- It's me.
- What?

964
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:25,398
He got me.

965
01:37:25,398 --> 01:37:26,858
Bad?

966
01:37:26,858 --> 01:37:29,151
No. I'm fine.

967
01:37:30,507 --> 01:37:32,383
Keep her close, Kee.

968
01:37:33,531 --> 01:37:36,971
Whatever happens, whatever they say,

969
01:37:38,327 --> 01:37:40,099
you keep her close.

970
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:45,834
It's going to be okay.

971
01:37:52,925 --> 01:37:55,740
She's probably got wind. Wind her.

972
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,076
Put her on your shoulder.

973
01:37:59,703 --> 01:38:02,204
Just... Just tap her back.

974
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,319
Gently.

975
01:38:17,846 --> 01:38:19,096
Gently.

976
01:38:33,383 --> 01:38:34,841
There you go.

977
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:39,846
Oh, Jesus.

978
01:38:42,975 --> 01:38:44,330
Dylan.

979
01:38:47,772 --> 01:38:51,316
I'll call my baby Dylan.
It's a girl's name, too.

980
01:39:13,631 --> 01:39:14,881
Theo?

981
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:19,678
Theo?

982
01:39:26,248 --> 01:39:27,290
Theo!

983
01:39:42,201 --> 01:39:44,494
Theo, the boat.

984
01:39:47,206 --> 01:39:48,457
The boat!

985
01:39:50,647 --> 01:39:52,106
It's okay.

986
01:39:52,733 --> 01:39:54,400
We are safe now.

987
01:39:55,444 --> 01:39:56,694
We're safe.

988
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:27,000
