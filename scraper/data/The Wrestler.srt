00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:16,506
But don't forget.
Two months. Rahway. Legend signing.

00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,666
- Sure.
- Thanks a lot, man.

45
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,760

Lenny, why are you doing this to me?

78
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,040
- You'll get in when I get my money.
- Aw, come on, Lenny.

79

You know I'm always good for it.

Yeah, you're always good for it
every time this happens.

81
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:23,712
Come on, brother. My back went out.
Let me just at least get my ice packs.

- Hey, Wayne, you got a second?
- Not really. Why?

89
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,203
Well, I was wondering
if you could throw me some more hours.

90
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,544
What's the matter?
Did they raise the price of tights?

91
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,915
Funny.

92
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,250
Let's see what we got.

93
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,813
Weekdays.
I'm busy on the weekends.

<i>All right, guys. Listen up.</i>

102
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,076
All right.
S.L.G., where are you?

103
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,552
- You're up first against T.D.S.

111
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:33,569
we got Tommy Rotten

- All right. Let's do this. Have a good time.
- <i>All right.</i>

115
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,501
Hey, Ram.

116
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,503
<i>Hey, there.</i>
<i>How you doing, man?</i>

117
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,665
Hey. Tommy. We're gonna
be working tonight.

118
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:05,142
<i>I know you, Tommy. I saw you out in, uh,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania a couple months ago.</i>

119
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,270
- Allentown.
- You were really good. You really brought it.

120
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,679
- Thank you. Thank you.
- <i>Keep working, man.</i>

121
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:12,377
<i>You know, people</i>
<i>who drive the Cadillacs...</i>

122
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,386
the ones with the politics-
they run the show.

123
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:17,582
- It ain't about ability, so you just hang in there.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

124
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,955
- All right.
- But, uh, as far as tonight...

125
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,994
I don't know what you wanna do.

126
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:25,087
I had a few ideas. I was thinking,
you know, maybe just for the heat...

127
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:28,793
- I would give you a low blow,
follow it up with a bulldog.
- Just bring the cheap heat, bro.

128
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,029
- You guys should get the heat on us right away.
- <i>All right.</i>

129
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:34,073
Keep the heat on us, beat the shit out of us.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

130
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,108
We'll come up,
we'll get on the ropes.

131
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,234
- You guys bring us both in the hard way.
- Okay.

132
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,144
Then we get up, double dropkick,
we powder out again.

133
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:43,148
All right.
So we're gonna really milk it tonight.

134
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,411
- We're gonna milk it.
Nice and slow, old-school, easy.
- Old-school.

135
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,079
Don't work his leg, man.
That's - Everybody does that.

136
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,622
- Work his neck. Work his neck.
- <i>No, no. We working the neck.</i>

137
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,658
- You're working the neck?
- <i>I already got the leg.</i>

138
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,319
- All right. You guys got the leg?
- Leg or neck. What you got?

139
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,228
- Maybe make your comeback right off there.
- Bang off the ropes...

140
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,926
<i>then super kick and, uh, Ram Jam...</i>

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,934
and we go have a beer, okay?

142
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,937
- That sounds great, man.
- You hang in there. You got a lot of ability.

143
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,438
- All right. All right.
- Okay?

144
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,496
- Right.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,667
Bless you.

151
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,299
You all right, Ram?

152
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,335
Ram, you all right?

153
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,564
- I'm gonna rip his arm off!
- <i>You want me to stop it?</i>

154
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,266
- Check him, ref!
- You want me to stop it?

155
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,332
Are you sure?

156
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,611
Come on.

157
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,928
I'll give you something to boo about!

158
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,698

00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,398
Come on! Get up!

164
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:55,600
<i>Is that what you want to see?</i>

165
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,735
<i>Come here,
you fat piece of crap!</i>

166
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:00,972
Get out there with
the rest of the party!

167
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,116
<i>I'm coming out there, and I'll beat the hell</i>
<i>out of each and every one of you!</i>

168
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,519
<i>You know who you're dealing with?</i>
<i>I will destroy you people!</i>

169
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:19,122
<i>Shut the hell up!</i>
<i>That's it, old man!</i>

170
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,361
<i>Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!</i>

171
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,426
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

172
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,511
Yeah.

173
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,831
Huh?

174
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,069
Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

175
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,837
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

176

Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

178
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,775
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

179
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:16,253
Ram Jam! Ram Jam!

00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:32,265
One, two, three!

181
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here is your winner...</i>

182
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:39,340
<i>Randy "The Ram" Robinson!</i>

183
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:50,189
Ram, you really popped that crowd.

184
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:53,792
- I'm just gonna glue this up, okay?
- Yep.

185
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,851
<i>Yo, Ram, you got a sec?</i>

186
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,862
Come on in.

187
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,456
You realize what's coming up?

188
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:04,367
- Huh?
- April 6.

189
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,463
Twentieth anniversary
of you and Ayatollah at the Garden.

190
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,202
- I know. Hey. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,471
- Long time ago.
- Time fucking flies, right?

192
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,536
Here's what I'm thinkin'

193
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,640
Two words: Re... match.

194
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,708
Okay, Ram.
You're all set.

195
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:23,084
We're doing this big Fanfest thing down
in Wilmington with Ring of Honor that weekend.

196
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,488
I wanna main event it
with you two guys.

197
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,494
"Ram, Ayatollah II."

198
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:32,827
Hey. I heard Bob was doing really good
with his used car lot out in Arizona.

199
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,629
- I don't know if he's gonna-You know.
- Come on. For this?

200
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,965
Bob's gonna dust off the old turban.

201
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,096
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,470
- Hey, bring it.
- Okay.

203
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,813
Hey.

204
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,179
- That's for Ram!
- Ram!

205
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,413
- Good stuff. Good stuff.
- <i>Good stuff. Just like the old days.</i>

206
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,883
Come on, guys.
Let's all go take a shower together.

207
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,159
What's up, Ram?
How you doing?

208
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,388
- What's up, Big Chris? What's shaking?
- I'm all right.

209
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:07,228
Yo, baby, you still got that hookup with
that quack at your gym? The juice head?

210
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,268
- What do you need?
- Yo, my back is killing me.

211
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,269
Vicodin, Perc, Nubain,
whatever he's got.

212
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:16,365
- Come by the mansion in a couple of days,
I'll hook you up.
- You the man, Ram. You the man.

213
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:30,282
<i>Grab some. Yeah.</i>

214
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,655
- Hey, Ruby. How you doing, baby?
- Hey, Ram. How's it goin'

215
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:36,889
- I'll take a cold one.
- All right.

216
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,691
There you go.

217
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,930
- Cassidy around?
- I think she's working the V.I.P.

218
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,567
Yeah, thank you.

219
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,228
<i># I got a question, if you can answer this #</i>

220
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,926
<i># I got a question #</i>

221
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,060
<i>Trust me, baby.
You're gonna be so happy.</i>

222
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,604
<i>I'm sorry, sweetie.
We said the other girl.</i>

223
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:22,436
<i>Yeah, the blonde girl with the
belly chain. Yeah, the other girl.</i>

224
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:26,842
- Well, yeah, but she's on break.
- <i>I'm sorry, but we really don't want you.</i>

225
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,881
- How old are you anyway?
- Oh, you're like my mom's age.

226
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:32,213
<i>Hey.
There's nothing like experience.</i>

227
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,718
<i>I do things your fiancée's</i>
<i>never even dreamed of doing.</i>

228
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,278
Yeah, like graduate in 1985!

229
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,649
Hey, hey. You girls are being
a little rude to the lady.

230
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,718
- How about an apology?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

231
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,457
Don't talk to the lady like that.

232
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:48,125
- I'll talk to her like I wanna talk to her.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

233
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,760
- You don't need to be talking to her like that.
- It's cool. I got it.

234
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:54,294
- I got it. It's all right, guys.
- No. Let me tell you something.

235
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:58,104
I guarantee you,
this lady's a hundred times hotter...

236
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,304
than any skank-ass pussy
you're gonna be marrying.

237
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,540
- What the fuck? That's my fucking sister.
- What you say?

238
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,276
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

239
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,784
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

240
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,911
- Fucker.
- See you soon.

241
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,890
200 fuckin' bucks walked out.

242
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,891
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

243
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,757
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>They were punks.</i>

244
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,922
- You!
- <i>Hey. Whoa. Easy there.</i>

245
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,556
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,796
<i>I'm better-looking
than them anyway.</i>

247
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:26,303
<i>I didn't mean to piss you off.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

248
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:28,738
Yeah? Okay.

249
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,743
- It's good to see you, Ram.
- Good to see you. Goddamn.

250
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:34,473
I haven't seen you in a while.
How you been?

251
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:37,778
Now, I'm telling you,
it was one of the historic matches in history.

252
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,444
It was 20,000 people.

253
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,387
Another million and a half
sitting at home watching it on pay-per-view.

254
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,550
We're slamming the piss
out of each other.

255
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,561
I mean, for God knows how long.
We're both gassing.

256
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:53,257
You ask any wrestling fan,
they've heard about that one.

257
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,766
- Million and a half. Shit.
- Oh, yeah, it was big.

258
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,099
And a rematch?
Hey. This could be history all over again.

259
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:04,141
Goddamn, look at you.
You are one smoking baby. Mmm.

260
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,701
Let me make an honest
woman out of you.

261
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,713
Hmm?

262
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:11,011
I mean, who knows?
I'm in pretty good shape right now.

263
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,950
You know, with a little luck,
this could be my ticket back on top.

264
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:17,511
- You never know who's in that crowd.
- Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,581
That would be a dream.

266
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,893
Oh, Jesus. You're bleeding.

267
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:26,591
- Oh!
- Yeah, I got cut tonight.

268
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:28,599
Oh!

269
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,635
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's nothin'

270
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,672
- They say wrestling's fake, huh?
- Fake? I'll show you fake.

271
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,264
Look at this.
1986, Denver Coliseum.

272
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,776
Billy Bob Banjo hit me
with a two-by-four.

273
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,813
It had a loose nail in it,
split my bicep right the hell open.

274
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,714
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Look at that. I got a better one than that.

275
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,751
Take a look at this here.

276
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,949
1988, okay?
Orlando Civic Center.

277
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,583
Mr. Magnificent threw me
over the top ropes.

278
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,992
I landed on my shoulder
and cracked my clavicle right in half.

279
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,326
Oh, my God.
Does it hurt?

280
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,061
Well, it hurts when I breathe, but, I mean,
you know, you hear the roar of the crowd...

281
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,433
you just-
you motor through, you know?

282
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,940
"He was pierced
for our transgressions.

283
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,101
"He was crushed for our iniquities.

284
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,737
"The punishment that brought us
peace was upon him...

285
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,872
and by his wounds we were healed."

286
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,816
Hmm. What was that all about?

287
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:22,945
It's <i>The Passion of the Christ.</i>
You have the same hair.

288
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,456
- You never seen it?
- No.

289
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,924
Dude, you gotta!
It's - It's amazing.

290
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:31,394
- They throw everything at him-
whips, arrows, rocks.
- Hmm.

291
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,432
They beat the living fuck out of him
the whole two hours, and...

292
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,991
- he just takes it.
- Hmm.

293
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,131
Tough dude.

294
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,404
Sacrificial Ram.

295
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,603
<i>Next on the main stage
will be Cassidy-</i>

296
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,738
- Aw.
- <i>with Harmony on the small stage.</i>

297
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,805
Aw, fuck.

298
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,975
- Gotta go.

335
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:23,323
Don't - Don't leave the foils on too long,
because last time they broke off.

336
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:27,099
I think they got too fried.

337

Here you go.
Lay it on, brother. Lay it on.

345
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:26,424
- Like- Like-
- There you go.

346
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,625
You're supposed to fall to your knees.

347
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,760
- Ooh.

348

350
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,880

- Go ahead. Once more.

351
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,349
- Now give it to me, brother.
- All right, man.

352
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,116
Fuck. Come on. Let's -

353
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,454
- Couple mousetraps?
- Load 'em and set 'em in the ring, body slam.

354
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,459
Hmm. Let's do it.

355
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:58,189
- How you doing, sir?
- How you doing?

356
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:01,790
- What's going on, my man?
- Tell me, what do you think?
What do you think about this?

357
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,301
Huh?

358
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,860
Huh?

359
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:09,908
- That'll work.
- Okay.

360
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,102
Come here.

361
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,145
Ah!

362
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:22,553
- <i>I don't look good, but I feel good.</i>
- Yeah.

363
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:26,057
So, my- my knees, my back,
anything you need me to do, sir.

364
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,149
Just maybe, uh, keep
the running to a minimum.

365
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:32,095
Like maybe I can hit the ropes once, take a bump
for you, but, like, no crisscrossing, please.

366
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:36,760
This hard-core stuff. What do you-Talk to me
about it. What do you wanna do tonight?

367
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,769
Well, are you cool with the staples?

368
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:40,896
- Staples?
- Staple gun.

369
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:45,000
- What do you mean?
- Like... staple gun.

370
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:47,045
- Staple gun.
- Yeah. You never did it before?

371
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:49,672
- Uh, no. Does that hurt?
- Silly question, but yeah.

372
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,114
- Man, uh, not so bad going in.
- Yeah.

373
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:55,176
Kind of scary. You know,
you got a big metal thing up against you, but...

374
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:58,712
pulling them out, they're gonna leave a couple
little holes, a little bit of blood loss there.

375
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,884
- Rock and roll.
- <i>Thank you, sir. It's an honor. Thank you.</i>

376
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,394

Randy, I'm Dr. Moayedizadeh.

449
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,862
So, how's it all looking?

450
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,330
<i>Well, much better</i>
<i>than before the bypass.</i>

451
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,833
Oh. So, we're in the clear?
We're all good?

452
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,335
Well, it's your heart.

453
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,463
<i>You need to start</i>
<i>taking better care of it.</i>

454
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,473
Like how?
What do I do?

455
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,169
<i>Well, for starters,</i>
<i>you're going to be on a slew of medications.</i>

456
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:10,340
<i>And the stuff that you're putting in your body-</i>
<i>you need to cut it out.</i>

457
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:14,145
I know. I know. I can-

458
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,710
I can- I can do without that.

459
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:21,282
When can I, uh,
get back in the gym and, uh...

460
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,486
start working out?

461
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,998
As far as exercise goes, it's still okay,
as long as it's moderate.

462
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,432
Doc, I'm a professional wrestler.

463
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,265
That's not a good idea.

464
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,629
Well, what do you mean?

465
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,403
<i>Well, your heart</i>
<i>has been through a lot.</i>

466
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:41,104
<i>It won't be able to handle</i>
<i>a strenuous activity.</i>

467
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:47,109
Well, I can slow my routine down.
I can- I can just pace myself.

468
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:49,745
- <i>Mr. Ramzinski-</i>
- Randy. Call me Randy.

469
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:53,951
<i>Randy, you almost died.</i>

470
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,357
Next time,
you might not be so lucky.

471
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,023
Well, hey, Doc.

472
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:05,763
Thanks for all the good news.

473
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,251
This copy's for you.

474
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,364
And somebody left this for you.

475
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,832
<i>He said he was your promoter.</i>

476
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:34,384
<i>Robin Ramzinski,
come to the pharmacy.</i>

477
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,484
- <i>Your prescription's ready.</i>
- Oh.

478
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:46,429
- Robin Ramzinski?
- Randy.

479
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:50,601
Just sign here, please.

480
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,936
Thank you.

481
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,649
Here you go.

482
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,748
My money.

483
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,788
One, two, three, four, five-

484
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:15,289
Welcome home.

485
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,949
Oh, shit.

486
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,860
Ooh.

487
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:10,312
Hey, Adam!

488
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:13,544
- You wanna play Nintendo?
- <i>All right.</i>

489
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,552
Okay.
Let's see what you got there.

490
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,282
- All right. Here comes the Ayatollah.
- Shaking in my boots.

491
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:21,553
- Here we go. Come on.
- So, you hear about Call of Duty 4?

492
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,560
Did I what?

493
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,562
- Call of Duty 4?
- What?

494
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,860
- Call of Duty 4.
- Call "It" Duty 4?

495
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,560
- Call <i>of</i> Duty 4.
- Call <i>of</i> Duty 4?

496
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:34,332
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, actually.
- Really?

497
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:38,171
<i>This game is so old.</i>

498
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:42,770
- Wh-What's it about?
- It's a war game. Most all the other Call of Duties-

499
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:46,647
they were, like, based on World War II,
but this one's with Iraq.

500
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,652
- Oh, yeah?
- And-Yeah.

501
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,654
You switch off between a Marine...

502
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:53,054
and an "S" and "S" British
special operative...

503
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,525
- so it's pretty cool.
- Wow.

504
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,687
<i>Hold on. All right. Hold on.</i>
<i>There we go.</i>

505
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:01,630
<i>All right. Here-</i> <i>There! There it is!</i>
<i>Ram Jam! You're finished.</i>

506
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,633
- <i>Okay, one more.</i>
- I gotta go.

507
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:05,635
- Huh?
- l- I gotta leave.

508
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:08,729
- I just gave you an ass-whipping.
Don't you wanna get even?
- Nah, that's okay.

509
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,297
- All right.
- l-I'll catch you later, all right?

510
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:13,310
All right.
See you later, man.

511
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:15,346
- Do your push-ups, brother.
- All right.

512
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:00,089
Oh, fuck.

513
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,174
- Hey!
- Hey.

514
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:28,309
Ram man!
Been a while.

515
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,411
- Hmm.
- Hi.

516
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:34,288
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood, thought maybe
we could go grab a- a hamburger.

517
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:36,349
I'm working.

518
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:39,863
Okay. You know, maybe later.

519
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:41,922
You okay?

520
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,426
- Could we talk for a second?
- Sure.

521
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:48,028
Sure. What's up?
What's up?

522
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:50,073
No, I mean somewhere quiet, not-

523
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,133
Randy-

524
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,680
I can't leave with
a customer, you know.

525
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:01,479
Listen. I had a heart attack.

526
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,389
<i>I know.</i>

527
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:08,925
- Where you parked?
- Out in the back.

528
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:11,826
Good. Go to your car.
I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes.

529
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,989
<i>So, they're just fucking,</i>
<i>or what's the story?</i>

530
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,761
You know what?
I'm gonna- I'm gonna go on break.

531
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,603
- I need a cigarette. I can't quit.
- Okay.

532
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:38,785
- Hey.
- <i>Thanks. I appreciate it.</i>

533
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:41,256
No, it's okay.

534
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:44,692
- <i>When was it?</i>
- Uh, a couple weeks ago.

535
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:47,925
Oh. How are you feeling?

536
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,628
Oh.
I don't feel like Hercules.

537
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:54,728
- What happened?
- <i>I just-</i>

538
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:58,969
I was walking in the dressing room,
and the guys told me I just...

539
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:03,275
dropped like a brick,
and, you know, I don't remember nothin'

540
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:07,750
Now the doctors tell me, uh...

541
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:09,752
that I can't -

542
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,913
that I can't wrestle no more.

543
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:16,149
What are you gonna do?

544
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:20,459
You know,
it just don't feel... right.

545
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,990
And that's why-

546
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:27,265
That's why I wanted
to talk to you, you know.

547
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,704
'Cause I don't want to be alone.

548
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,245
Randy.

549
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:41,482
You should be with your family now.

550
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:44,919
Don't you have a daughter?
Where's your daughter?

551
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,981
Uh, my daughter-
she don't like me very much.

552
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,653
<i>I don't believe it.</i>
<i>Everybody needs a father...</i>

553
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:53,162
and... trust me...

554
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,494
this kind of thing
brings people together.

555
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:58,262
Ah-

556
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:00,930
<i>You should call her.</i>

557
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,997
I should go back in.

558
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:06,339
You're gonna be okay, huh?

559
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,970
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.

560
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:31,057
Stephanie.

561
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,600
Hi, this is Stephanie.
Leave a message.

562
00:47:12,777 --> 00:47:14,768
Ah-

563
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,201
Man.

564
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:02,087
Oh. Uh, is, uh, Stephanie home?

565
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:07,295
- Who can I say it is?
- Uh, tell her it's her father.

566
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,543
Hey. Stephanie.

567
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:31,287
- Where you goin'?
- What do you want?

568
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:35,051
Well, I just- I have to talk to you.

569
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,060
I can't really talk right now.

570
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:39,619
- I really need to talk to you.
- I have school.

571
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:41,631
- You're going to school?
- Yeah.

572
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:43,667
Well, that's great.

573
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:48,899
Listen. I had a heart attack...

574
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:52,204
and I just thought
I needed to tell you.

575
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:58,180
You are such an asshole.

576
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,183
What do you want from me?

577
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:02,242
<i>What do you want?</i>

578
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,378
I just been alone, and, uh...

579
00:49:04,455 --> 00:49:08,186
you're my daughter, and I love you, and I just-
I just needed to see you.

580
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:10,250
That's bullshit.

581
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,318
You want me to take care of you.

582
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:14,057
- No.
- <i>Yes.</i>

583
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:17,760
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

584
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:21,293
'Cause where the fuck were you
when I needed you to take care of me?

585
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,306
You know, on all my birthdays...

586
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:25,365
<i>which you never even made one.</i>

587
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:28,878
<i>You probably don't even</i>
<i>know when it is.</i>

588
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:33,349
So, you know what? No. I don't care
if you had a heart attack. Fuck you!

589
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:53,502
- Oh! Ram.
- Hey.

590
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:55,596
- Didn't think I'd see you here.
- Why not?

591
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:56,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

592
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:59,072
I heard you collapsed
at the DiFusco show.

593
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:02,476
Ah, man, I just overheated
and blacked out. That's all.

594
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,413
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah, I was out of the hospital in less than an hour.

595
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:08,280
- <i>So, you're fine?</i>
- Brother, I'm good to go.

596
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:11,753
That's excellent!
I was just gonna cancel the minivan.

597
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:14,552
- What minivan?
- I rented one for Fanfest.

598
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,559
Yeah, m-me and the whole
gang's driving down.

599
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,959
Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback.

600
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:20,997
Oh, I'm so fucking psyched!

601
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,363
<i>Volpe gave me an assload offlyers.</i>

602
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:28,197
Yeah. It's gonna be epic.

603
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:31,400
<i>Volpe said the scout from</i>
<i>the show was gonna be there.</i>

604
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,568
- Uh-
- <i>Twenty years in the making.</i>

605
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:36,477
- It's gonna be something.
- Yeah. Come on. I got you set up down here.

606
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:39,948
- Hey, bro.
- Hey. What's going on, bro?

607
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:42,485
So, uh, yeah.
Should get a pretty good crowd today.

608
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:45,454
Oh. Great.
I'll, uh- I'll loosen up.

609
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:47,490
All right.

610
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:51,426
- Hey, my man. How you doing, big guy?
Good to see you. Wow.
- Haven't seen you in a while.

611
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:11,303
- <i>Smile.</i>
- <i>Who makes your T-shirts?</i>

612
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,680
<i>I like your T-shirts.</i>

613
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,685
- How much for an autograph?
- Ten dollars.

614
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,847
- Ram. Been a big fan of yours for years.
- Hey. How you doin', brother?

615
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:21,790
- It's really great to meet you. Can I get a Polaroid?
- All right. Absolutely.

616
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:23,827
Okay. Ready, guys?

617
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:25,759
<i>Ram!</i>

618
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:27,763
- What's your name again?
- <i>Evan.</i>

619
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:31,767
- Evan. E- E-V-
- E-V-A-N.

620
00:51:31,835 --> 00:51:35,168
- <i>One, two, Ram!</i>
- There we go.

621
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:38,867
Okay, it's eight.
There you go, Matthew.

622
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:40,877
- Here you go.
- Yeah, hold on.

623
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:51,088
<i>Well, no. It's $30.</i>

624
00:51:51,154 --> 00:51:53,514
<i>You gotta get the VHS.
I'll give you the VHS.</i>

625
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:26,886
Hi, I'm Cassidy.

626
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:29,858
- Henry.
- Nice to meet you. Where you from?

627
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:31,986
- Garfield.
- Yeah?

628
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:33,996
How you doing tonight?

629
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,157
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm?

630
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:38,861
How about a private dance,
make you feel a little better?

631
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:42,167
- Mmm, no, not tonight.
- No, Henry?

632
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,571
- No.
- No? Okay.

633
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:46,370
<i>And don't forget
Tuesday night is-</i>

634
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:51,779
<i># Is how you dance</i>
<i>You're up to no- #</i>

635
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:55,908
Nah.

636
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:00,115
<i>On the main stage, the exotic-</i>

637
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,616
<i>Hey. Hey, you.</i>

638
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:07,789
Hey. When'd you get here?

639
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,856
- <i>I just flew in.</i>
- You did?

640
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:13,369
- How you been feeling?
- I'm feeling good.

641
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:15,905
- A lot better.
- Good.

642
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:19,374
And I took your advice.
I went and saw my daughter.

643
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:21,604
Yeah? How did that go?

644
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:23,612
Uh, it didn't go very well.

645
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,205
She sort of ripped me a new asshole.

646
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:28,217
Oh. Oh.
Sorry to hear that.

647
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,912
Oh, hey.
What are you gonna do?

648
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,818
Oh, just-

649
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:35,723
Maybe if I went out
and did something special, you know?

650
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:38,785
- Bought her a present.
- That's a really great idea.

651
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,330
- Well-
- What's she into?

652
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:43,559
Hmm. Yeah, I don't really-
You know.

653
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,727
What kind of music does she like?

654
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:47,828
I really don't know.

655
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:51,966
Well, is she into something else,
like, well, cooking or books or something?

656
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,033
Oh.

657
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:59,009
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well...

658
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,813
you should get her clothes,
like some kind of clothes.

659
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,785
- All girls like that. Yeah.
- Yeah?

660
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:06,687
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Hey. I know the right place.

661
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:10,693
It's this kick-ass little vintage shop
in Elizabeth.

662
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:13,286
- Ah.
- I think it's on Elizabeth Avenue.

663
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:16,059
You should go on Saturday.
That's when they get all the best shit.

664
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,294
Hey, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

665
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,294
You want a dance?

666
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,875
I don't think
I'm quite ready for that yet.

667
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:31,503
Okay.

668
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:34,209
<i># We about to blow, oh #</i>

669
00:54:34,283 --> 00:54:36,444

<i>I can represent hood ##</i>

672
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:00,671
<i>Well, that was fast.</i>

673
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:03,371
Listen. Why don't I meet you
there on Saturday...

674
00:55:03,446 --> 00:55:06,381
and, um- and help you
pick something out?

675
00:55:08,484 --> 00:55:10,543
- Wow. I'd like that a lot.
- Oh.

676
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,178
- 1:00?
- Yeah.

677
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:15,349
- All right.
- 1:00.

678
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:17,915
Yeah, 1:00.

679
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,538
Hey. Whoa.

680
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:35,577
Did you forget how to knock?

681
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:38,443
- No.
- Let's try that again, all right? I'm serious.

682
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,692
What do you want?

683
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,025
Well, I was wondering if I could
get some more work- something, uh...

684
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:56,121
- you know, steady, full-time.
- Ah, cell phone.

685
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,133
All I got is weekends.

686
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,226
Yeah, well, that works.

687
00:56:01,404 --> 00:56:03,429
Isn't that when you sit on
other dudes' faces?

688
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:08,738
- So, what do you got?
- <i>Deli counter.</i>

689
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:12,372
- Deli counter.
Dealing with the customers and stuff?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

690
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:14,643
A parade of hot, horny housewives...

691
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:16,651
begging for your meat.

692
00:56:18,054 --> 00:56:20,648
- You got anything else?
- No, I do not.

693
00:56:20,723 --> 00:56:23,248
You interested?

694
00:56:25,494 --> 00:56:28,486
Yeah. Sure.

695
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:51,584
- Hey!
- Hey.

696
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:53,884
Goddamn.
I almost didn't recognize you.

697
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:56,186
You look-You look clean.

698
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:57,817
Clean?

699
00:56:57,893 --> 00:56:59,656
No, I mean you look lovely.

700
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:02,596
Okay. Thanks.

701
00:57:02,665 --> 00:57:06,533
Uh, listen. Should I call you, uh,
Pam or Cassidy or what?

702
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:08,365
- Pam.
- <i>Pam.</i>

703
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:10,371
Don't get used to it.

704
00:57:10,439 --> 00:57:12,566
What is she?

705
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,940
Goth? Punk? Hippie?

706
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:18,003
- Preppy?
- Oh, man, I ain't got a clue.

707
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,840
Oh. Hey, Pam.

708
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:25,011
- <i>Pam.</i>
- Yeah. Mm-hmm?

709
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:27,885
Thank you.
I really appreciate this.

710
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,850
You're welcome.

711
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:34,020
<i>Uh, listen.</i>

712
00:57:34,096 --> 00:57:36,223
I think Stephanie is, uh...

713
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,233
a lesbian.

714
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:39,825
Uh-huh?

715
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:42,200
Does that make
a difference what she-

716
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,068
No.

717
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,133
- <i>It's cool.</i>
- I mean, or maybe it's all in my head. I don't know.

718
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,248
Oh, wow. What about this?

719
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:55,841
Look at this.
Got an "S" on it.

720
00:57:55,918 --> 00:57:58,148
- Um-
- That looks perfect, huh?

721
00:57:59,155 --> 00:58:01,248
Well-

722
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:05,351
I mean, it's winter, so maybe you want
something warmer, like a peacoat.

723
00:58:05,428 --> 00:58:07,555
You got a point there.

724
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,497
- If you know her size.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

725
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:13,330
I don't know, man.
I think that's pretty rock and roll.

726
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:16,894
- What do you think?
- l-

727
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,974
You should go with your gut, man.

728
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,532
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

729
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:25,273
You know, you look so goddamn pretty
in the daytime.

730
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:28,078
Hey, have a beer with me?

731
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:31,244
Uh, I gotta get going.

732
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,652
- <i>One beer.</i>
- I really-

733
00:58:36,192 --> 00:58:38,126
I got a- I got a kid.

734
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:41,095
You have a kid?

735
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:43,097
<i>Well.</i>

736
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:46,430
- What do you have, a boy or girl?
- <i>Boy. Jameson.</i>

737
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:49,062
- So, how old?
- Nine.

738
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:53,370
Wow. Hmm.
Who would figure, huh?

739
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,842
Well, it's not something
I usually tell the customers.

740
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:58,937
It's not exactly-
It's not a turn-on.

741
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:02,974
Uh, hold on.
Wait a second.

742
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:15,293
I want you to give this
to your little guy. It's a-

743
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:17,764
<i>It's a Randy the Ram
action figure.</i>

744
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,825
Tell him not to lose it.
It's a $300 collector's item.

745
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:23,804
- Really?
- No.

746
00:59:23,873 --> 00:59:27,468
Come on. Hey, one beer.

747
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:31,773
Okay.

748
00:59:31,847 --> 00:59:35,112
That's a great-looking kid
you got there.

749
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:37,414
I think so.

750
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,284
Well, I can see where
he got his good looks from.

751
00:59:40,356 --> 00:59:43,655
Yeah. Well, he doesn't
get it from his father.

752
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,190
What's that?

753
00:59:49,265 --> 00:59:51,665
Oh, that's this condo thing
down in Trenton.

754
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:55,627
What are you thinking about,
moving there?

755
00:59:55,704 --> 00:59:57,638
- Workin' on it. Yeah.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

756
00:59:57,706 --> 00:59:59,867
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the schools

757
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:03,275
<i>great neighborhood, and... cheaper.</i>

758
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:05,643
What about your gig
over at, uh, Cheeques?

759
01:00:05,714 --> 01:00:09,047
Done. Quitting.

760
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:13,879
- Oh, wow.

761
01:00:17,493 --> 01:00:19,120
Whoa! Hell, yeah!

762
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:20,958
<i>All right!</i>
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

763
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,328

764
01:00:23,399 --> 01:00:25,128

766
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:31,165
Okay. I'll dance for you then.
Here we go.

767
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,800
<i># That's where we meet #</i>

768
01:00:33,876 --> 01:00:37,642
- Think I can get you a shift.
- Hey, man, I need a job.

769
01:00:37,713 --> 01:00:39,647
<i>There we go.</i>

770
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,717
Ooh! It's a lap dance I'm getting.

771
01:00:45,788 --> 01:00:48,018
# I knew right from the beginning #

772
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,083
#That you would end up winning #

773
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:54,652
# I knew right from the start #

774
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,494
#You'd put an arrow #

775
01:00:57,566 --> 01:01:00,000
#Through my heart #

776
01:01:02,137 --> 01:01:04,731
# Round and round #

777
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:08,903
<i>Yeah! Goddamn, they don't</i>
<i>make 'em like they used to.</i>

778
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:11,776
- Fuckin' '80s, man. Best shit ever.
- Bet your ass, man.

779
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,781
- Guns N' Roses fuckin' rules.
- Crüe.

780
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:15,510
- Yeah.
- Def Lep.

781
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,018
Then that Cobain pussy
had to come around and ruin it all.

782
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:20,112
Like there's something wrong
with wanting to have a good time.

783
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:22,419
I'll tell you something.
I hated the fuckin' '90s.

784
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,756
- Nineties fuckin' sucked.
- Nineties fuckin' sucked.

785
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:38,906
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

786
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:43,541
No contact with the customers.
I gotta go.

787
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,637
Hey. You said one beer.

788
01:01:46,715 --> 01:01:47,807
- I did?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

789
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:50,443
Oh, okay.

790
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:53,386
<i># I knew right from the beginning #</i>

<i>Here you go.</i>

797
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:28,318
Hey, bro.
This is supposed to say "Randy."

798
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,824
I guess they got it
off your W-4 or something.

799
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:33,123
So I really gotta wear
one of these things?

800
01:02:34,196 --> 01:02:36,721
No, you're special.

801
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,563
Well, uh, can you change it?

802
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:41,967
Just wear the fuckin' thing,
all right?

803
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:43,971
Ah.

804
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:12,224
Oh, fuck.

805
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:16,193
Uh, here's your bologna, pal.

806
01:04:19,935 --> 01:04:22,870
Eighteen.

807
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:25,771
Are-Are they all on sale,
or just the regular ones?

808
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:29,038
- The Hudson Acres. Uh-
- Well, it wasn't very clear.

809
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:31,773
- Let me check.
- <i>Okay.</i>

810
01:04:35,184 --> 01:04:37,118
Wayne, to the deli counter.

811
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:39,484
It'll just be a minute.

812
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:44,151
<i>Okay. So, uh, which, in your opinion,</i>
<i>is the best smoked ham?</i>

813
01:04:44,226 --> 01:04:46,660
- The best what?
- Smoked ham.

814
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:49,027
- Uh-
- Which?

815
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:52,494
I don't -
Smoked ham, I guess-

816
01:04:52,568 --> 01:04:54,729
Uh, the maple-glazed is not bad.

817
01:05:02,177 --> 01:05:04,304
- Breasts, thighs.

Okay. Comin' up.

Half a pound of pesto pasta
on the button.

824
01:05:37,012 --> 01:05:40,379
- Can I get you anything else?
- <i>No, that's it.</i>

825
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:43,976
- You have a lovely day, darling.
- Thanks. You too.

826
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:50,057
Forty-seven.

I want a eight-piece.
That's two breasts.

That's what I want. Two big breasts.

831
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:09,709
Two big breasts-
Uh, something with a brain.

832
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:13,214
- And two wings? Yeah, stay away from them thighs.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

833
01:06:13,282 --> 01:06:16,479
A lot of chicken flying out the door.
There you go, honey. Have a good day.

834
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:18,645
- <i>Thank you. Have a good day.</i>

849
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:06,260
Listen, uh, you're gonna have to
count me out of Utica.

850
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:09,327
What do you mean?
We've been selling tickets for a week!

851
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:11,872
Nah, I'm retiring.

852
01:07:15,777 --> 01:07:18,610

Oh, come on. I'm sorry, Volpe.
You know I'd kill to do it.

855
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:34,926
- I already bought Bob's plane ticket.
- No, I realize. I understand.

856
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:37,591
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Nah, no more. I am done.

857
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,600

01:08:10,866 --> 01:08:13,164
<i>Stephanie.</i>

What, are you stalking me?

860
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:19,333
No. I, uh, brought you a present.

861
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:22,743
Go ahead. Open it.

862
01:08:34,056 --> 01:08:36,115
The "S" stands for "Stephanie."

863
01:08:36,191 --> 01:08:38,284
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

864
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,294
Do you like it?

865
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:43,297
It's, uh- It's shiny.

866
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:46,493
That's not really your present.
I got you something else.

867
01:08:46,568 --> 01:08:48,502
Hold on.

868
01:08:52,774 --> 01:08:55,242
This is your real present.

869
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:07,180
- It's a peacoat.
- Yeah. Well, it's wintertime...

870
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:10,053
and I want you to keep warm.

871
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:15,691
- Thank you.
- Hey, anything for you, sweetheart.

872
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:18,426
So what are you doing right now?

873
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,434
What am I doing?

874
01:09:20,502 --> 01:09:24,734
You know, I thought maybe we could,
you know, stop by our old favorite place.

875
01:09:24,806 --> 01:09:27,775
We have an old favorite place?

876
01:09:27,843 --> 01:09:30,277
You'll recognize it when you see it.

877
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:35,439
Uh, now's not really
the best time. l-

878
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:37,678
I got some stuff I gotta do.

879
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,244
What kind of stuff?

880
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:43,052
Just stuff.

881
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,616
Come on.
I'm not gonna, like-

882
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:47,889
I'm not gonna take a bite
out of you or anything.

883
01:09:47,963 --> 01:09:50,864
Just, you know,
hang out for a little while.

884
01:09:55,871 --> 01:09:57,805
I haven't been here in ages.

885
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:02,500
You remember the fun house?

886
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:06,776
Right there.
Used to be the Monster Motel.

887
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,782
- Kinda.
- Oh, you loved it.

888
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:12,251
We used to go in there,
and they had this, uh, spooky-ass skeleton.

889
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,584
It would pop out of a coffin.

890
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:17,090
You'd get really scared
and cry and wanna run out.

891
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:21,255
And then- then you'd beg
to go back in again.

892
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:23,889
Oh. Always was a glutton
for punishment.

893
01:10:23,965 --> 01:10:26,490
Yeah, you wouldn't go in
unless you could sit on my foot...

894
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:28,502
and wrap your arms around my leg.

895
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,266
And we'd walk all the way
through like that.

896
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:35,207
Ah, I don't even remember that.

897
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:37,268
I do.

898
01:10:46,588 --> 01:10:50,285
I just want to tell you.

899
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,292
<i>I'm the one...</i>

900
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,295
who was supposed to
take care of everything.

901
01:10:55,363 --> 01:11:00,323
I'm the one who was supposed to make
everything okay for everybody.

902
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:05,901
But it just didn't
work out like that.

903
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:07,908
And I left.

904
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:09,910
I left you.

905
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:13,614
You never did anything wrong.

906
01:11:13,682 --> 01:11:16,947
You know?
I used to try to-

907
01:11:17,018 --> 01:11:18,952
Huh! Forget about you.

908
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:22,717
I used to try to pretend that...

909
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,726
you didn't exist.

910
01:11:25,794 --> 01:11:27,728
But I can't.

911
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,166
You're my girl.

912
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:35,533
<i>You're my little--</i>
<i>You're my little girl.</i>

913
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:38,931
<i>And now-</i>

914
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:44,902
I'm an old,
broken-down piece of meat.

915
01:11:46,948 --> 01:11:49,508
And I'm alone.

916
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:51,677
<i>And I deserve to be all alone.</i>

917
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:56,183
I just don't want you to hate me.

918
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:04,765
Okay?

919
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:31,191
Hey.

920
01:12:34,663 --> 01:12:36,597
Oh.

921
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:40,599
Oh, man, we can't go in there.

922
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:42,603
Come on.

923
01:12:45,807 --> 01:12:47,741
Oh, God.

924
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:55,145
- Whoo, man. Wow.
- This must have been a ballroom or something.

925
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:58,883
Oh, look at this.
We can-

926
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:00,888
Hey, here we go.

927
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:05,188
- What is that?
- It's my bow to you.

928
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:09,496
Am I supposed to bow back?
I bow to you?

929
01:13:09,564 --> 01:13:11,498
Ah.

930
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:20,974
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

931
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:28,348
You can lead.
You're not bad.

932
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:30,748
Well, thank you.

933
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:41,740
Hold on.

934
01:13:43,565 --> 01:13:45,499
Wait.
Let me get the door.

935
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:52,866
Well, I hope that wasn't
too painful for you.

936
01:13:52,941 --> 01:13:56,775
- No, it was okay.
- Yeah, well-

937
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:59,313
Okay, uh, bye.

938
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,508
Bye.

939
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,575
Hey, maybe we could
go out to dinner sometime.

940
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:07,053
- Dinner?
- You know, on Friday or something?

941
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:10,691
Whatever works for you.

942
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,290
Saturday would be better.

943
01:14:14,362 --> 01:14:16,353
- Saturday?
- Yeah.

944
01:14:16,431 --> 01:14:18,365
You got it.

945
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:24,905
Oh, wow.

946
01:14:28,877 --> 01:14:31,311
Wow.

947
01:15:27,535 --> 01:15:30,060
<i>Hey, you there. Hey.</i>

948
01:15:41,015 --> 01:15:43,575
Come on. Open it.

949
01:15:43,651 --> 01:15:45,585
I'll wait till later
when it's quiet.

950
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:48,383
Oh, come on.
I want to watch your face when you read it.

951
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,304
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

952
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:08,399
Hey, thank <i>you.</i>
I mean, come on, baby. You saved my ass.

953
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:13,811
What?

954
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:15,816
I can't... do this.

955
01:16:15,884 --> 01:16:19,149
Can't do what?

956
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,211
This.

957
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,715
I thought we had
a little something going on here.

958
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:28,854
<i>No. W-Well-</i> <i>l- I think you're awesome.</i>
<i>I think that you're a great guy.</i>

959
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,522
So what's the problem?

960
01:16:30,598 --> 01:16:34,398
You think that I'm, like,
this stripper, and I'm not.

961
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:36,494
I'm a mom.

962
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:40,132
I have responsibilities.
I have a son.

963
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,870
<i>Anyway, you don't want</i>
<i>that fuckin'luggage, so-</i>

964
01:16:42,944 --> 01:16:45,640
What if I do?

965
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:47,647
I can't go there.

966
01:16:47,715 --> 01:16:50,377
- <i>What about the other day?</i>
- It was a mistake.

967
01:16:52,086 --> 01:16:54,020
It didn't feel like a mistake to me.

968
01:16:54,088 --> 01:16:57,182
The club and the real world-
they don't mix.

969
01:16:57,258 --> 01:17:00,022
I don't know. I'll tell you,
I think that's a lot of bullshit...

970
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:03,359
because I think
you still feel something.

971
01:17:03,431 --> 01:17:08,061
You're a customer, okay? You're a fucking
customer. I don't go out with customers.

972
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:10,468
<i>You got it?</i>

973
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:12,272
Yeah, I got it.

974
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,057
<i>Hey, can I have some
tequila over here, please?</i>

975
01:17:14,123 --> 01:17:15,270
<i>Sure.</i>

976
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:18,801
<i>I tell you what. Here.</i>

977
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,849
- <i>What's that?</i>
- I want a dance.

978
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,645
Stop it.

979
01:17:23,718 --> 01:17:26,186
What's the matter?
You gonna refuse a paying customer?

980
01:17:26,254 --> 01:17:28,745
- I want a goddamn dance, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

981
01:17:28,823 --> 01:17:31,189
- Get up there and move your ass.
Squeeze your titties together.
- <i>Fuck off!</i>

982
01:17:31,259 --> 01:17:32,886
- Shake your fucking ass-
- Fuck you!

983
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:34,553
<i>Ram!</i>
And pretend you like me!

984
01:17:34,629 --> 01:17:37,257
- <i>Gimme a goddamn dance!</i>
- <i>Get the fuck outta here!</i>

985
01:17:37,332 --> 01:17:39,926
- <i>Ram! Let's take it outside.</i>
- <i>Want a drink, my man?</i>

986
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:41,935
<i>No, I'm okay.</i>

987
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,783
Oh, God.

988
01:18:27,715 --> 01:18:29,842
- <i>Ram! Hey, man. What's happening?</i>
- Hey, Larry.

989
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,318
How ya doin' What are you doing here?
I thought you retired.

990
01:18:32,387 --> 01:18:34,787

Hey, what's up there?
I haven't seen you for a while.

994
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:44,596
All good?

995
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,782
Yeah!

996
01:19:16,764 --> 01:19:20,359

01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,546
- Nah, 'cause of this guy.

1002
01:19:34,616 --> 01:19:36,106
- Exactly.
- They did. They loved it.

1003
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:39,153
- So how you been, man?

1004
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:42,485

My brother used to have
your poster on his door.

1011
01:20:06,614 --> 01:20:08,775
Well, your brother's got good taste.

1012

<i>Yeah, it was a pretty hot picture.</i>

1013
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:13,486
So, what are you doing
in our town of Rahway?

1014
01:20:13,554 --> 01:20:15,749
<i>We did a show over at</i>
<i>the rec center tonight.</i>

1015
01:20:15,823 --> 01:20:18,053
Wrestling.

Party?
What do you call party?

1020
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:32,772
I don't know.

1021
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,774
Party like a fireman party.

1022
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,581
Oh, shit, that's speedy.

1023
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:45,645
Oh!

1024
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,892
Oh, get a fucking room.

1025
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,894
Oh, yeah!

Oh, God.

1031
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:39,466

Goddamn it!

1035
01:23:15,136 --> 01:23:17,536
Hey, uh, is Stephanie home?

1036
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:26,105
<i>Steph, guess who</i>
<i>finally decided to show up.</i>

1037
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,375
<i>Yeah, he's standing outside.</i>

1038
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:33,153
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i>

1039
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:39,590
<i>I've seen you get stressed out. I don't want you</i>
<i>to be stressed. Let me get this asshole out.</i>

1040
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,150
- <i>Just don't, don't say anything.</i>
- Hey.

1041
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:43,595
- <i>Who said you could come in?</i>
- <i>What are you doing in here?</i>

1042
01:23:43,664 --> 01:23:45,723
- <i>I'm sorry, Stephanie. I'm so sorry.</i>
- No, get the fuck out!

1043
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,234
- I'm gonna handle this, okay? I can handle this.
- Obviously not.

1044
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:51,999
- I can handle this!
- <i>Oh, come on. I'm sorry I screwed this up.</i>

1045
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:53,734
- I'm so sorry.
- <i>Wait. Don't worry.</i>

1046
01:23:53,808 --> 01:23:56,436
- <i>I just-- You don't have to leave.</i>
- <i>I'll be back.</i>

1047
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,535
Fuck.

1048
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:01,241
I waited in that restaurant for two hours-
Two fucking hours-

1049
01:24:01,315 --> 01:24:03,749
telling myself, " Maybe something happened.
Maybe he's stuck in traffic."

1050
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:06,412
But, no! You just keep doing
the same shit to me over and over again!

1051
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:08,114
I know, and I apologize.
Look, I apologize.

1052
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:10,316
I got a lot of stuff
swimming around in my head...

1053
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:12,951
and I went out and had a drink,
and another drink, and I just spaced.

1054
01:24:13,027 --> 01:24:16,463
- That is tough shit!
- Goddamn it. Why do I do this to you?

1055
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:19,465
Because you are a fuck-up!

1056
01:24:20,735 --> 01:24:23,363
<i>You're a living,</i>
<i>breathing fuck-up...</i>

1057
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:25,564
