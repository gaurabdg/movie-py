00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:09,609
It's got "microphone"
written on it.

1115

Gentlemen, if I have
offended you in any way...

1116
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:17,473
KNUCKLES:
Don't worry about it.

1117
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:18,907
We're fond of
the little fella.

1118
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:20,074
And let's face it,

1119
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:23,073
if anyone can recognize
a criminal gang, it's us.

(ALL AGREEING)

1121
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,807
We'd be grateful for any help.

1122
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,140
Please.

1123
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,839
Well? Knuckles.

1124
00:55:28,841 --> 00:55:32,006
I'm afraid I don't recognize
any of them. Lads?

1125
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:33,106
ALL: No.

1126
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:34,773
I'm afraid
I couldn't possibly comment.

1127
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:35,772
Oh.

1128
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:37,205
KNUCKLES:
Sorry to say it, kid,

1129
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,073
but your friends are barking
up the wrong tree.

1130
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:42,106
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

1131
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:46,072
Sounds more like a fancy dress
party than a criminal gang.

1132
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,673
PADDINGTON: Then,

1133
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,809
what are we going to
do now?

1134
00:55:58,474 --> 00:55:59,907
- (BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
- Oh!

1135
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,907
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

1136
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,709
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

1137
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,375
Keys. Keys. Keys!

1138
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:11,876
Bottoms!

1139
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,540
You can't park here!

1140
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,674
I'm not parked,
I'm doing the bins.

1141
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:20,272
You're not doing the bins,
sunshine,

1142
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:23,238
you're studying
on council time.

1143
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,073
I'm gonna report you.

1144
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:26,639
And your hat.

1145
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:29,406
- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown.

1146
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:31,138
Judy asked me
to drop these off to you.

1147
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,840
CURRY: Propaganda!

1148
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,238
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

1149
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,373
Everyone round here knows
it was your bear that done it.

1150
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:43,073
And this street is a far,
far better place without him.

1151
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:44,538
- What?
- (WOLFIE BARKING)

1152
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,674
Oh, it's that mangy dog!

1153
00:56:46,676 --> 00:56:49,039
You are going to the pound,
my son.

1154
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,072
Barking without a license
in a built-up area.

1155
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,372
Give them here, Mary.

1156
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,839
I have to sell them
under the counter,

1157
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,238
for obvious reasons,
but people are buying them.

1158
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,338
Really?

1159
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,106
It's a bloomin' good read.

1160
00:56:59,108 --> 00:57:00,406
Made a few people round here

1161
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:01,805
think twice
about your young bear.

1162
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:03,972
You just need to find
that thief.

1163
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:06,039
Oh, we're trying.

1164
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,907
Don't suppose you know where
he is, do you, Feathers?

1165
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:10,442
He's behind you.

1166
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:12,572
Sorry, what?

1167
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,173
PHOENIX: Coo-eee!

1168
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,606
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

1169
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:17,940
Why don't you come on in?

1170
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:21,738
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

1171
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,572
Mysterious things have been
happening all over town.

1172
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,739
- Oh, yes?
- Strange characters

1173
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,974
turning up at every landmark
in that book.

1174
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:30,305
Are they?

1175
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,338
I don't know.

1176
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,007
Perhaps
it's just a coincidence.

1177
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:36,939
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

1178
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,238
Well, you're an artist, Mary,
like me.

1179
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,874
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

1180
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:46,440
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

1181
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:49,172
I think dear old Henry might
have a point.

1182
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,472
Do you?

1183
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:52,872
But I do have a little bit
of good news

1184
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:55,306
that might turn your frown
upside down.

1185
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,573
Oh, yes?

1186
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:58,506
It looks, fingers,
fingers, fingers,

1187
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,071
as though the funding
may be coming through

1188
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:01,238
for my one-man show.

1189
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,806
Oh. Right.

1190
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:04,505
It's an evening of monologue
and song,

1191
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,338
featuring some of
my better known characters.

1192
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,973
Would you like
a little preview?

1193
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:09,406
Um...

1194
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:14,673
Picture this scene. Darkness,
then suddenly spotlight, me,

Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

1199
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:26,940
No. No, no, no.

1200
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:29,272
I suppose
it seems so unfair

1201
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:31,540
Paddington is in prison
and yet

- life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

1203
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,172
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

1208
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:50,575
Yes, but... how do you know
he had blue eyes?

1209
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:52,238
Hmm?

1210
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,374
It's just a pencil sketch.

1211
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,672
Ooh.

1212

Well, then I must have
colored him in. (CHUCKLES)

He's a master of disguise.

- She's gone mad.
- MARY: Think about it, Henry.

1216
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:13,440
Someone out there knows about
the Kozlova fortune, right?

1217
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:15,039
Alleged fortune.

looking for a criminal gang.

Knuckles?

1220
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,971
- Because there was no gang.
- It was one man.

1221
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,340

I'm wrong, shall we?

Knuckles?

1248
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,640
KNUCKLES: Got a proposition
for you, kid.

1249
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,039
Me and the boys have
been talking, and

1250
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,339
seems to us,

1251
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:45,373
if you're gonna clear
your name,

1252
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,738
you're gonna need our help.

1253

The Browns may mean well,
but...

1254
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:51,706
It takes a thief
to catch a thief.

1255
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh.

1256
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,372
KNUCKLES: Now, if we could
figure a way out of here

1257
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,739
and hit the streets,

1258
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,672
we'd find this guy
soon enough.

1259
01:00:58,674 --> 01:01:01,672
But that would mean... escape.

1260
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:04,372
KNUCKLES: It certainly would.
And we got a plan.

1261
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,338
But it's a four-man job,
so we need your help.

1262
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,938
What do you say, kid?

1263
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,806
It's very kind of you,
Knuckles,

1264
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,605
but I don't think
Aunt Lucy would like

1265
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,506
the idea of us breaking out
of prison.

1266
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,772
The Browns will find
the real thief.

1267
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,938
I just need to be patient.

1268
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,639
You may not wanna hear this,
kid,

1269
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:26,741
but sooner or later

1283
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:06,774
Yes. We thought the agent

01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,073
would be really interesting.

1285

But I've got two minutes,

Well, send him my best.

Mr. Buchanan back on stage?

(CHUCKLES) No, no, no,
don't get me wrong.

1302
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:57,805
He's a terrific actor,

1303
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,206
but there is a teensy
little problem.

Really?

1305

He won't work
with other people.

1306
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:06,473
Thinks they dilute his talent.
