1
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:23,635
Are you Kathy Nicolo?

2
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:27,768
Yeah.

3
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:30,979
ls this your house?

4
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:04,369
Nadi of course agreed
that it was a wonderful idea...

5
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,467
to cut down the trees
at our home on the Caspian.

6
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:12,243
To have the sea spread before us.

7
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,983
To reach infinity with our eyes.

8
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:18,010
To see forever.

9
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:25,826
But then, our life
went the way of the trees...

10
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,266
when the Ayatollahs ripped the soul
out of our beautiful country.

11
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,870
Well, enough.

12
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,436
Today is not a day for the old.
lt is a day for the young.

13
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:43,739
To the future.

14
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:48,147
To our Soraya. May she be a happy wife
as she is a bride.

15
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:54,216
And perhaps she will not forget
her poor mother and father so soon...

16
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,748
and return to us and give to us
many little grandbabies.

17
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,093
A father can dream.

18
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:38,361
He's so tanned.
Retirement has been good for the Colonel.

19
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,561
He's not retired. He works for Boeing.

20
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:43,902
He doesn't work for Boeing.
My son works for Boeing.

21
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,371
Who knows what he does now.

22
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,190
-Hello.
-Kathy?

23
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,399
-What time is it?
-It's 9:00.

24
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,006
Mom, that's 6:00 a.m. here.

25
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,373
l don't think 6.:00 a.m. will kill you.

26
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:05,881
Your father got up at 4.:30 every day
of his life, God bless his soul.

27
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,178
So how is it going? How is the program?

28
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,621
Fine. l'm fine.

29
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,020
One day at a time, right?

30
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:18,160
l just hope it's working.

31
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,658
How is everyone there?

32
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,426
Frankie's good. Salesman of the month
again. You know your brother.

33
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,633
His Lisa 's in her seventh month.

34
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,467
How's your better half?

35
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:32,037
Fine.

36
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,603
He's right here. He's sleeping.

37
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,871
Sleeping?

38
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,842
Mom, l'm really tired. l'm gonna go, okay?

39
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,275
Listen, l almost forgot.
Your Aunt Frances won a trip to Reno.

40
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:46,651
And we'll come out on the 18th.
l thought we'd stop by to see you.

41
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:49,350
-The 18th?
-Yeah. Two weeks.

42
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,283
Yeah, okay.

43
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,424
Nick's gonna be away on business, though.

44
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,055
-Again?
-Yeah.

45
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,501
l'm gonna go, okay, Mom?

46
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,400
Listen, you're still not smoking, right?

47
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,701
-Bye.
-'Cause, you know, they say--

48
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,060
Just a second.

49
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:40,673
You Kathy Lazaro?

50
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:43,138
Yeah. Why?

51
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:51,847
Due to the nonpayment of business taxes
associated with this property...

52
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:56,324
the county has petitioned the court
on its behalf to reclaim these costs.

53
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:00,993
This should come as no surprise to you.
l'm sure you've had ample warning.

54
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,589
We've sent many notices.

55
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:08,535
Now the house is up for auction
starting tomorrow morning.

56
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:10,397
Auction?

57
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:13,632
What are you talking about?
Are you out of your mind?

58
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,171
There's no smoking in my house.

59
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,656
Hey, Chuck.

60
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,724
Because l see your number right here.

61
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,228
Are we going to meet down there?

62
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,699
lt's supposed to be a hot one today.

63
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,226
l'd dress lightly if l were you.

64
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:44,532
That's okay, because l'm not leaving.

65
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,298
l'm afraid you have no choice, Mrs. Lazaro.

66
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:50,735
All of your things will be
auctioned off with the property.

67
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,474
Do you want that?

68
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,846
Look, you can't evict me.

69
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:59,547
l never owed a fucking business tax.
lt doesn't make any sense.

70
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:05,354
Okay. Well, this is where l get off.

71
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:09,430
Deputy Sheriff Burdon will assist you
with vacating the property.

72
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,910
Do you have a lawyer?

73
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:32,187
l can't afford a lawyer. l'm a house cleaner.

74
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,423
This is the number for
the Legal Assistance Office.

75
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:40,291
They might be able to help.

76
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,390
Nothing's written in blood.

77
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:46,629
You just have to clear out today.
You might be moving back in next week.

78
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,597
ln the meantime...

79
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:53,931
maybe you can call some friends or family,
stay with them.

80
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,511
There's no one to call.

81
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,577
l tell you what.

82
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,852
l know some movers that owe me a favor.

83
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,386
Brian.

84
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:16,360
Why don't you go down to Safeway
and get some boxes.

85
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,727
Let's help this lady pack up.

86
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:22,963
Lester.

87
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,056
May l help you?

88
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,632
My car is parked here.

89
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:56,805
You asked yesterday also.

90
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,913
-What happened to you?
-l fell.

91
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:19,747
-Again?
-Yeah.

92
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:22,817
Wash up. Do not get blood on the floor.

93
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:37,319
The house was repossessed
for tax payment delinquency.

94
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,293
lt's got three bedrooms, one bath.

95
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:42,228
A widow's walk would increase the value
of the property.

96
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,993
What is this ''widow's walk''?

97
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:47,627
lt's a deck on top of the house,
so you can see the ocean.

98
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:51,070
We still got some time here.
Feel free to take a look around.

99
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:19,785
You should have a brown hat
on your head, not a blue one.

100
00:17:22,197 --> 00:17:24,131
Why are you not working today?

101
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,568
Nadereh...

102
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:38,575
today God has kissed our eyes.

103
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,886
Do you remember our bungalow
on the Caspian?

104
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:50,049
How l ordered the trees cut down
on the west side...

105
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,956
so that we may view the sea?

106
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,724
Please, be quiet.

107
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:58,631
Do you remember how the General
brought his family there for New Year...

108
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,224
how beautiful it was?

109
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,136
What is the matter for you today?

110
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,747
l today have bought
for us another bungalow.

111
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,516
l have purchased this home for a price
of which no one would believe.

112
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:20,487
lt is worth two, maybe three times that.

113
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,954
We will live in this home
for a short while...

114
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:26,517
and then sell it and find one even better.

115
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,827
l did not come to America
to live like an Arab.

116
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,869
A family roaming the street like gypsies.

117
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:38,270
l came to the States just to live normally.

118
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,859
Perhaps you did not come here
to live like a gypsy.

119
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,493
But l did not come here
to work like an Arab.

120
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,965
To be treated like an Arab.

121
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:13,166
For four years, we have lived a life
which we could not afford...

122
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:17,110
and spent almost everything
to marry Soraya with a good family.

123
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,870
This apartment alone
has cost us over $140,000 in rent.

124
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,946
And what of Esmail's
university education?

125
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:27,578
Soon we will have nothing.

126
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:32,890
Then you will see what it is like
to walk in the shoes of the gypsies.

127
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,738
So beginning tomorrow,
you will begin packing.

128
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:49,538
There's no more to discuss, Mrs. Behrani.
Do not open your lips.

129
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:05,353
$500?

130
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:08,288
They evicted you from your house
for that?

131
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:09,853
You got it.

132
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,101
Are you staying with friends?

133
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,567
Yeah, l'm with a friend.

134
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,472
How much is this going to cost me?

135
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:23,534
lt's on a sliding scale.

136
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,248
How come you didn't
do something about this earlier?

137
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:31,047
l did. l went to the courthouse
months ago.

138
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:37,254
l signed a statement saying that
l never owed a business tax because...

139
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,693
l never owned a business.

140
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,320
l even had it certified.

141
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:44,932
And what about the follow-up mail?

142
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,157
l didn't open it.

143
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:58,735
lt's very important to me
that l get my house back by the 18th.

144
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,507
l'm expecting company.

145
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,647
When did you sign that letter?

146
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,709
l don't know. March?

147
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:08,647
l hate to be the bearer of bad news...

148
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:11,215
but evidently
the county's already sold your house.

149
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:12,385
What?

150
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:17,656
No.

151
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,066
They can't do that.

152
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:22,228
The auction date has been set for months.

153
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,364
Look, don't worry.
l'll demand they rescind the sale...

154
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,910
or we'll file a lawsuit against the county.
We'll get your house back.

155
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,604
Before the 18th, right?

156
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,503
lt's possible.

157
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:19,786
Fuck.

158
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:26,556
Hello?

159
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:35,936
Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you.

160
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:37,875
Don't do that.

161
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,404
You all right?

162
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:43,583
Yeah, l'm fine. You?

163
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,043
Good.

164
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,389
You working undercover or something?

165
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:55,791
Excuse me?

166
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,632
No, l'm off.

167
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:02,501
l just.... l drive by this way...

168
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,672
and figured l'd check in on you.

169
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,068
See how you're holding up.

170
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,571
They already sold your house?

171
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,743
Technically, it's mine and my brother's.
My dad left it to us when he died.

172
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,216
l haven't told my family.

173
00:23:21,623 --> 00:23:24,751
My lawyer is trying to get them
to rescind it.

174
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:29,489
So, l'm trying not to harp on the negative.

175
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:39,867
You have any kids, Mr. Burdon?

176
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,769
Two.

177
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,078
Call me Lester.

178
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:52,011
My husband left me eight months ago.

179
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,153
No one knows that either.

180
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:18,237
Do you mind if l give you
some professional advice?

181
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,337
No.

182
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,678
Do it all through your lawyer, Kathy.

183
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:26,543
l wouldn't even drive past that house
till the keys were back in my hand.

184
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,583
Thanks for checking in on me.

185
00:24:32,594 --> 00:24:33,583
Sure.

186
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:37,526
Night.

187
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,696
Kathy, wait.

188
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,202
Listen, this is my direct number
at the department.

189
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:51,606
Most the time, l'm out on patrol,
but if you ever need anything...

190
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,081
anything at all, just leave a message.

191
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:00,944
See you.

192
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,816
Good night.

193
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:04,243
lt is like our garden in lsfahan.

194
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:47,455
Hello?

195
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,162
Yeah?

196
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:02,437
Your credit card didn't go through.
That's two days now.

197
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:11,017
God, l'm really sorry about that.

198
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:14,587
Look, l'm gonna
get my paycheck on Friday.

199
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,988
ls there any way
we can just let it slide until then?

200
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:04,421
The only affordable way
to put a terrace up there...

201
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,790
is to put the stairs on the outside.

202
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:10,521
lt will have to block that kitchen window.

203
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,630
l could do that for about $1,000.

204
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,933
lf we have to go through the roof,
you're talking $4,000 to $7,000.

205
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:20,406
But this window must be obstructed?

206
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:22,534
l don't see any other way.

207
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:25,408
That is acceptable.

208
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,477
Can you start today?

209
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:59,034
What are you doing?

210
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,464
Excuse me?

211
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,066
What the fuck are you doing?
This is my house.

212
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:04,133
Who are you?

213
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,840
This is my house.
Who said you could do this?

214
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,247
-Are you Mrs. Behrani?
-No.

215
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:13,251
Mr. Behrani hired us.
You're gonna have to talk to him.

216
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:28,727
Fuck.

217
00:32:29,337 --> 00:32:30,395
Shit.

218
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,163
Damn.

219
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,807
Stay right there. Don't move.

220
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,068
Oh, man.

221
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:41,545
Let's get her inside.

222
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:42,913
Here. Come on.

223
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,215
Careful.

224
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:58,991
Can we use your bathroom?
She stepped on a nail.

225
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:07,369
Sorry, ma'am. Could we use
your washroom to clean her foot?

226
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:14,913
lt is okay.

227
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,618
For one moment, please.

228
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:38,896
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

229
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,270
Have you had a tetanus shot lately?

230
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:45,907
l'm going to be sick.

231
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,880
ls she bleeding?

232
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,109
Excuse me.

233
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,493
l don't want to ruin your towel.

234
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,602
Here. l use this for skateboarding.

235
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:14,698
Don't worry. l washed it.

236
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:25,310
Okay?

237
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,948
This is of course our family pictures.

238
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,052
Thank you.

239
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,093
l think l should go.

240
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:42,124
What happened?

241
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,266
l'll tell you what happened.
My yard is a construction site.

242
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:46,927
l'll tell you what happened.
My yard is a construction site.

243
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:51,838
-You were there?
-Yeah, l was there. l was at my house.

244
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:53,901
l stepped on some nails.

245
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:58,105
l was bleeding on my own doorstep,
waiting for a stranger to open my door.

246
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:01,444
You can't just go over there.
You gotta let us handle this.

247
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:09,049
l want them out of my house.

248
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:13,658
They're already more at home there
than l ever was.

249
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,826
Did you get their name?

250
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:27,870
Bahroony? Behmini, something like that.
l don't know. They're Middle Eastern.

251
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,741
-Gary?
-Yes, Connie?

252
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:36,211
Type up a letter to the courier service
and make sure it gets to a Mr. Behrmini.

253
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,138
lt's damn hard to sell a house nowadays.

254
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,911
This is what you call a real buyer's market.

255
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:16,523
Sorry, but she comes in at $174,000.

256
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:53,955
-You're late, Behrani.
-l'm not late.

257
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:57,623
l have come to tell you that
l am no longer to return to this job.

258
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,158
You tell the office, Colonel?

259
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:02,626
No.

260
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,898
So why tell me, man?

261
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,997
ls this you?

262
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:45,036
''...inform you that
under these circumstances....''

263
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:54,515
''...we request that
you vacate the property immediately.''

264
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:59,816
Mother whores. God damn it.

265
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:34,991
Mr. Barmeeeny is here.

266
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,692
Mr. Barmeeny.

267
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,933
My name is Behrani.

268
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:43,665
Col. Massoud Amir Behrani.

269
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:47,004
l wish to speak with Mr. Walsh, please.

270
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:50,243
l'm Connie Walsh.
This is my office, Colonel.

271
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:52,736
Please come in.

272
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:01,478
l'm sure our letter came as a shock to you.

273
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:03,147
The situation is this:

274
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:06,387
Pacific County has made
a number of mistakes.

275
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,021
First, they levied a tax on my client
which she did not owe.

276
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:12,964
Second, they evicted her for nonpayment.

277
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,024
And third, they auctioned the property...

278
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:17,366
and unfortunately, sir,
this is where you come in.

279
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:19,497
But l now own the house.

280
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:22,872
l paid for it in cash. l have a bill of sale.
Here, please.

281
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:26,607
Would you be willing to
sell the county back the house?

282
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,049
l can assure you they would make it
as comfortable a transaction as possible.

283
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,848
Please listen to me
very carefully, Miss Walsh.

284
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,214
The only comfortable
transaction possible...

285
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,987
is if the county tax office
paid to me $174,000.

286
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,826
Mr. Behrani, you only paid
a quarter of that amount.

287
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:50,333
The market can already pay me this.
Good morning, Miss Walsh.

288
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,337
Wait, please?

289
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,801
From a legal standpoint,
you are in the right.

290
00:40:56,877 --> 00:41:00,574
But the true owner of this house
is living in a motel, Mr. Behrani.

291
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:02,843
All her belongings are locked in storage.

292
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,477
Now, why should she wait
to get back into her home...

293
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:10,047
that was wrongfully taken from her
just because you want to turn a profit?

294
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:12,885
Things are not as they appear.

295
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,821
lt is a matter of necessity
for me and my family.

296
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,932
l'm sorry.
l do not have a choice in this matter.

297
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,706
This is a surprise.

298
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,800
Good one or a bad one?

299
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,873
lt's good.

300
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:41,711
What happened to your foot?

301
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:47,585
l stopped by my house, and they were
doing some construction on the roof.

302
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,282
l stepped on some nails.

303
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:52,223
Thanks for letting me ride along
today, Mr. Burdon.

304
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:58,397
So, how's the El Rancho?

305
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:00,057
l'm not there anymore.

306
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,599
l'm staying at the Bonneville now.

307
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,001
l don't know it.

308
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:07,069
You're looking at it.

309
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:24,317
l haven't had a drink in three years, Lester.

310
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:28,884
l'm sorry.
l should have asked, l didn't know.

311
00:43:28,963 --> 00:43:30,328
lt's okay.

312
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:37,667
The fog's coming in.

313
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:49,382
l'd like to ask you
a personal question if l could.

314
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:51,378
Okay.

315
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:54,517
Just get it over with.

316
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:57,655
Why is your husband no longer with you?

317
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:03,152
l wanted kids.

318
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:06,561
He didn't want kids.

319
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:12,198
But l guess if he really wanted me,
he would have wanted them, too.

320
00:44:18,912 --> 00:44:20,709
l think he's a fool.

321
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,016
Maybe we should find you a place to stay.

322
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:46,566
Do you remember
the beauty of the Caspian Sea, Esmail?

323
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,334
The water like glass,
the beach sand like gold.

324
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,849
lt is beautiful here.

325
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,250
Massoud, when must we move again?

326
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:04,450
Not too soon.

327
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:09,025
Perhaps once we get a buyer,
we will tell them to wait until autumn.

328
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:10,959
Would you prefer that?

329
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,860
l will do as you wish.

330
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,595
There was this little runt of a guy.

331
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:24,341
Kept beating up his wife.
Except she wouldn't press charges.

332
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:28,844
We'd show up and they'd be, at the door,
like Romeo and Juliet.

333
00:45:29,283 --> 00:45:30,773
Arm in arm.

334
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:33,653
She had welts and bruises all over her.

335
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:36,848
So, one night,
we get called out there again.

336
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:41,224
And l slip down their hallway,
and stuff two eight balls in his closet.

337
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:43,729
Turned out he was on parole.

338
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:46,727
He goes back to jail. She's safe.

339
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:49,801
And l slept like a baby.

340
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:55,664
Did l just lose you?

341
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:56,835
No.

342
00:45:58,178 --> 00:45:59,577
l'm sorry.

343
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:04,480
To tell you the truth,
l think the wine is distracting me.

344
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,678
-l'll send it back.
-No, it's fine.

345
00:46:06,854 --> 00:46:08,344
-You sure?
-Yeah.

346
00:46:08,922 --> 00:46:12,983
See, when l think of my sobriety,
l don't think about wine.

347
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:15,820
Alcohol was never a problem.

348
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:19,389
You're a grown woman.

349
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:37,877
Cheers.

350
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:01,201
-What are your kids' names?
-Nate and Bethany.

351
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,095
Nate is four. Bethany is nine.

352
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:07,873
Where is your house?

353
00:48:07,941 --> 00:48:10,671
Millbrae. ln a housing development...

354
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:13,646
called Palomino Meadows.

355
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:16,175
You have to drive through it
to get to the mall.

356
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,241
Yeah, l know where that is.

357
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:22,146
God, l've probably driven by it
a dozen times.

358
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,758
l've probably even seen your wife.

359
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:28,153
Carol.

360
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:31,157
Yeah, Carol.

361
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:37,495
What's your situation, Les?

362
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,473
l married my best friend.

363
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,770
And for seven of the last nine years...

364
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:46,870
l haven't wanted to give her
more than a hug or a peck on the cheek.

365
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:49,204
That's my situation.

366
00:48:49,283 --> 00:48:50,648
What about her?

367
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:53,180
lt's not the same for her.

368
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:07,191
Do you want to come inside?

369
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,314
We are blessed.

370
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,701
What time is it?

371
00:50:56,643 --> 00:50:59,077
-lt's 10:00.
-Oh, God.

372
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:02,745
l should have been home hours ago.

373
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,909
l'm sure Carol called the department.

374
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:08,512
And l'm sure they asked her
if l was feeling any better.

375
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:16,328
Things are finally in motion.

376
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:20,097
l'm finally going to get it over with.

377
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:22,357
lt?

378
00:51:23,837 --> 00:51:26,203
Telling her the truth about how l feel.

379
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:30,174
How do you feel?

380
00:51:38,852 --> 00:51:40,319
l feel found.

381
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:06,611
Well, Kathy, bad news.

382
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,677
The county's done their part...

383
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:10,875
but the new owner
won't go along with the deal.

384
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:13,579
He's asking
for four times what he bought it for.

385
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:16,349
We can sue the county,
but that'll take months.

386
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:22,926
Do you mean that
l can't legally get my house back?

387
00:52:23,063 --> 00:52:26,396
lt would have been a lot easier
if you'd just opened your mail.

388
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,696
You can't expect the law to work miracles.

389
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:33,364
l don't expect miracles.
l expect you to do your fucking job.

390
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:40,939
l don't know what l'm doing
sitting here talking to you.

391
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:44,581
And as you see, very excellent rooms.

392
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,216
lt is cool inside, even during the day.

393
00:52:48,288 --> 00:52:51,746
And from the widow's walk,
sunsets are quite beautiful.

394
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:53,759
There is very little fog in this area.

395
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:55,317
When would the house be available?

396
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:59,195
Not until autumn at the earliest. We would
need some time to find a new home.

397
00:52:59,266 --> 00:53:00,893
That might work for us.

398
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:08,601
Yes, she has come for a tool her boyfriend
carpenter may have left behind.

399
00:53:08,675 --> 00:53:11,610
l have been expecting her.
One moment, please.

400
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:14,746
l am happy you came.

401
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:16,873
Please, this way. l will show you.

402
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,783
My family knows nothing of this.
l'd like for it to remain so.

403
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:22,048
l think you have me confused
with someone else.

404
00:53:22,122 --> 00:53:24,590
No, l'm quite certain l know who you are.

405
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:27,186
l'm Kathy Nicolo.

406
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,888
l know my lawyer talked to you,
Mr. Bahroony...

407
00:53:30,964 --> 00:53:32,864
but l thought we could meet face to face.

408
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,800
My name is Behrani. Colonel Behrani.

409
00:53:36,136 --> 00:53:38,229
Colonel Behrani, l'm sorry.

410
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:42,301
Look, my father left us this house.
He left it to me and my brother and--

411
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:45,310
Tell these things to the bureaucrats
at the county tax office.

412
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:46,709
They made the mistake, not l.

413
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,807
They said they'd give your money back,
and l know you've put that deck on.

414
00:53:50,884 --> 00:53:52,784
l'm sure they'd repay you for that.

415
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:55,514
l'm sorry, miss, but l have
nothing more to say to anyone.

416
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:58,080
Why should l be penalized
for their incompetence?

417
00:53:58,158 --> 00:54:00,558
You should sue them
for enough money to buy 10 homes.

418
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:03,824
l'll sell you this house for the right price.
That's all l require.

419
00:54:03,897 --> 00:54:07,765
l do not know where he left his hammers.
There is nothing more to say of it.

420
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:09,165
Let go of me.

421
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:13,602
You can't expect to just move in here
and make money off of this.

422
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:15,300
This is my house.

423
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:19,744
l lived here, and you stole this house
from me, you son of a bitch.

424
00:54:30,423 --> 00:54:34,450
This is a stolen house!
He's trying to sell you a stolen house!

425
00:55:11,564 --> 00:55:13,555
What did you tell your kids?

426
00:55:14,834 --> 00:55:16,426
l told them the truth.

427
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:22,236
My old man walked out on us.
l swore l would never do that to my own.

428
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:42,191
What happened?

429
00:55:45,432 --> 00:55:50,096
My lawyer couldn't get the house back,
so l went to see the owner.

430
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,562
-And he put his hand on you?
-lt's okay.

431
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,570
-Don't worry about it.
-That's not right.

432
00:55:57,177 --> 00:55:59,338
He's got no right to do that.

433
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,415
Who is this guy?

434
00:56:06,186 --> 00:56:07,881
His name's Behrani. He's a Colonel.

435
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:10,514
Behrani? What country is he from?

436
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,648
l don't know.

437
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:14,057
But his wife hardly speaks any English.

438
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:20,764
Maybe they haven't been here that long.

439
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:23,831
Maybe they don't know their way around.

440
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,771
-What are you doing?
-l'm going to pay him a visit.

441
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:35,337
Officers tend to listen to other officers.
lt's worth a shot.

442
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,407
What if he doesn't listen?

443
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:40,718
Then l'll make him listen.

444
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,696
Little bird.

445
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:04,609
Welcome to our new home.

446
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:08,839
Does it go down the hill?

447
00:57:08,915 --> 00:57:10,906
lt is an investment property, Soraya.

448
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:13,817
You remember,
like our second home on the Caspian.

449
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:16,789
lt's an investment home.

450
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:25,227
Let us go to the roof porch for the view.

451
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:44,946
Jesus, look at them.

452
00:57:45,117 --> 00:57:48,052
What are they celebrating?
Stealing a woman's house?

453
00:57:51,123 --> 00:57:53,091
Fuck these people.

454
00:57:53,158 --> 00:57:55,388
You're a very wise man, Genab Sarhang...

455
00:57:55,461 --> 00:58:00,125
to live in such a place
that gives you a view of God's wonders.

456
00:59:23,115 --> 00:59:25,208
Did you post that sign, sir?

457
00:59:25,918 --> 00:59:28,614
Yes, is there a difficulty, Officer?

458
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:31,281
And that's your sign
at the bottom of the hill?

459
00:59:31,356 --> 00:59:32,448
Yes.

460
00:59:34,459 --> 00:59:36,518
Please come in, Officer.

461
00:59:48,073 --> 00:59:51,907
l am new to the area.
ls a permit required to post signs?

462
00:59:53,145 --> 00:59:56,842
Not on the house.
But the utility pole, that's city property.

463
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:57,973
l see.

464
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:02,514
Very well. l'll put the sign elsewhere.
Thank you for informing me.

465
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,648
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

466
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:08,192
This is my home. l am an American citizen.

467
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:11,355
-Were you a General?
-l was a Colonel.

468
01:00:13,665 --> 01:00:16,725
Tell me, Officer, what more can l do
for you this evening?

469
01:00:16,802 --> 01:00:18,394
What's your name?

470
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,328
Massoud Amir Behrani.

471
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,496
And the names of your family?

472
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:26,804
Why do you need the names of my family?
What is your name, Officer?

473
01:00:27,012 --> 01:00:30,914
Deputy Sheriff Joe Gonzalez.
Now let me ask you a question, Colonel.

474
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:32,814
Are you selling this house on your own?

475
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:35,114
l do not wish to offend, Officer...

476
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:37,815
but if you'd excuse me,
l have work to do this evening.

477
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:39,720
Civil Code 1 101 .

478
01:00:40,325 --> 01:00:42,020
Yes, you have informed me.

479
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:45,086
l suggest you come with me
to witness the removal of the sign.

480
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:48,360
No, l'm talking about
the disclosure law, Colonel.

481
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:52,769
You, the owner, have the obligation
to tell all prospective buyers...

482
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:55,997
anything about the property
they have a right to know.

483
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,865
l do not understand.

484
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:00,142
You sure about that?

485
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:02,237
Are you interrogating me, Mr. Gonzalez?

486
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:06,216
No, you tell me. l understand your friend,
the Shah, made a real habit of it.

487
01:01:06,284 --> 01:01:09,481
l don't know who you think
you're speaking to, but l've had enough.

488
01:01:09,554 --> 01:01:12,045
You've done your job. You may leave.

489
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:25,963
You're used to giving orders, aren't you?
Let me get right to the point here.

490
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:29,701
Pacific County has offered you money.
They don't want any trouble.

491
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:33,140
The only one that seems
to want trouble around here is you.

492
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,247
You don't want to do the right thing,
which is to sell this house back...

493
01:01:37,315 --> 01:01:41,581
at the price you paid for it,
so it can be returned to the real owner.

494
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:45,314
The real owner, Mr. Behrani.
Now that just won't wash.

495
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:03,997
l have more than one contact
at lmmigration.

496
01:02:04,643 --> 01:02:07,373
People get deported every single day.

497
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:10,679
There are a lot of things l can do.

498
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:14,408
l suggest you call the movers
so l won't have to.

499
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:40,067
What happened?

500
01:02:41,179 --> 01:02:43,977
Well, the guy's obviously
not right off the boat.

501
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:45,881
l think you're right.

502
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:49,216
He probably buys up seized property
just to make a killing.

503
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:53,052
l set him straight. l think he'll listen.

504
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:57,790
He will.

505
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:06,599
So what do we do now?

506
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:13,209
Look at us. We're both homeless.

507
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:33,891
My friend has a cabin a few miles south.
We can stay there.

508
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,895
Give to me answer, Behrani.
What did that man say of deporting?

509
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:43,372
-He said nothing, Nadi.
-Do not lie to me! l heard him !

510
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:46,069
Who was that man? Tell to me, Behrani.

511
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:48,078
Behman behgoo, what have you done?

512
01:03:48,146 --> 01:03:50,706
lt's none of your business
what l have done or not done.

513
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:52,340
Have you no faith in me? No respect?

514
01:03:52,417 --> 01:03:54,908
That man only said
l must remove the sign. That's all.

515
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:56,681
Coward! Liar!

516
01:03:57,289 --> 01:03:59,382
You kasifliar!

517
01:03:59,724 --> 01:04:02,989
lt is your fault
we were forced to flee from lran.

518
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:05,254
lt is your fault that we are here!

519
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,625
Yours and your Savak friends!

520
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,149
How long can we stay here?

521
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,258
Till we get things figured out.

522
01:06:26,972 --> 01:06:28,439
You hungry?

523
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:30,564
l could eat.

524
01:07:31,036 --> 01:07:32,901
Do you still love her?

525
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:39,805
Look, it's just....

526
01:07:41,413 --> 01:07:42,971
lt's not her.

527
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:46,745
She's a good person, a good mother.

528
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:55,050
Would this have happened anyway?
Even if you hadn't met me?

529
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:57,856
Yes.

530
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:11,399
l miss my dad.

531
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:21,210
He worked really hard for that house.

532
01:08:23,922 --> 01:08:25,412
lt took him...

533
01:08:29,027 --> 01:08:31,120
thirty years to pay it off.

534
01:08:32,497 --> 01:08:35,295
And it took me eight months to fuck it up.

535
01:08:46,077 --> 01:08:49,137
We're going to get your house back. Soon.

536
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:53,884
When this is all done, l promise...

537
01:08:55,286 --> 01:08:57,186
l'll move you back in myself.

538
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,236
My son...

539
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:54,536
do not follow the example of your father
one day when you are married.

540
01:09:54,612 --> 01:09:56,637
Do not do as l did last evening.

541
01:10:00,385 --> 01:10:02,853
Do not be disrespectful, son. Look at me.

542
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:13,921
-Were you a Savaki?
-No.

543
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:18,700
l only bought fighter planes for
Shah-ansha.

544
01:10:19,037 --> 01:10:20,971
Why did that man say
we will be deported?

545
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:22,472
l do not know.

546
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,607
But we are American citizens.
We own this house.

547
01:10:25,677 --> 01:10:27,611
They can do nothing to us now.

548
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,508
l feel bad for that lady, Baba jahn.

549
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:36,980
The woman's house was taken from her
because she did not pay her taxes.

550
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,547
That happens when one is not responsible.
Do you understand?

551
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:44,458
Do not feel bad. Americans,
they do not deserve what they have.

552
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:47,191
They have the eyes of children,
who are forever looking...

553
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:50,962
for the next source of distraction,
entertainment, sweet taste in the mouth.

554
01:10:51,035 --> 01:10:52,559
We are not like them.

555
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:58,371
We know rich opportunities when we see
it and don't throw away God's blessing.

556
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:04,981
You know l must raise money
for your university education.

557
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:06,983
l can get another paper route.

558
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:15,218
l know.

559
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:18,261
You are kind child.

560
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:21,964
Quickly becoming a man.

561
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,061
You have my respect for your heart.

562
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,544
Soon all this will be over.

563
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:44,818
Thank you.

564
01:12:46,017 --> 01:12:47,712
Have a good day at work.

565
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:59,658
You need to see
what you're doing to this family.

566
01:12:59,731 --> 01:13:02,598
Look at your children,
at the damage you're causing.

567
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:05,795
-This is not the time for this, Carol.
-When is the time?

568
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,134
When l'm not on my way to work.

569
01:13:10,842 --> 01:13:12,070
Stop it!

570
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:16,242
Do you want to get arrested?
ls that what you want?

571
01:13:16,314 --> 01:13:20,444
You want to arrest me? God, go ahead,
arrest me in front of our children.

572
01:13:21,486 --> 01:13:23,113
Daddy, please!

573
01:13:28,693 --> 01:13:30,718
God, l didn't mean to do this.

574
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:32,922
Don't go. Please don't go.

575
01:13:33,731 --> 01:13:36,700
We checked, and we have no Joe Gonzalez
on the force.

576
01:13:36,768 --> 01:13:38,702
Did he have anything else on him?

577
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,102
Any pins, anything that might
help us to lD him?

578
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,198
We have hundreds of deputies
in the department.

579
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,002
He wore a golden star.

580
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:50,880
A badge with two pistol barrels crossed.

581
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,950
And letters of gold spelling F-T-O.

582
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:13,866
There are only eight Field Training Officers
in the whole department.

583
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:15,963
Tell me if you see him here.

584
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:26,174
Yes.

585
01:14:27,518 --> 01:14:31,249
That is him.
That is the man who threatened me.

586
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:33,885
lt's Burdon.

587
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:37,689
You're completely confident
this is the officer?

588
01:14:43,634 --> 01:14:47,730
l'm sorry this happened to you, sir.
l can promise you it won't happen again.

589
01:15:09,627 --> 01:15:11,288
What do you think?

590
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:14,264
l cleaned the whole place.

591
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:18,496
What's wrong?

592
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:23,265
Kath, l need to go home for a while today.

593
01:15:24,308 --> 01:15:27,368
l need to go home and explain things
to Carol better...

594
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:29,910
to Nate and Bethany.

595
01:15:30,815 --> 01:15:33,909
l should be home
when they come back from school.

596
01:15:34,652 --> 01:15:36,415
You just said ''home'' three times.

597
01:15:36,487 --> 01:15:37,784
lt is my home.

598
01:15:40,258 --> 01:15:42,419
At least until we make another one.

599
01:15:45,062 --> 01:15:46,359
Are you coming back?

600
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,660
A couple of hours. Three at the most.

601
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:50,901
l'll understand if you don't.

602
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,535
l don't deserve you.

603
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:05,605
Of course you do.

604
01:17:24,362 --> 01:17:25,386
Fuck.

605
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:34,365
l told the kids
that this was just temporary...

606
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:38,500
that you were just taking some time off,
like a vacation.

607
01:17:39,477 --> 01:17:41,741
l didn't know what else to tell them.

608
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:45,572
Tell them the truth, Carol.

609
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:56,316
Hello.

610
01:17:56,594 --> 01:17:58,391
Deputy Lester Burdon?

611
01:18:07,038 --> 01:18:08,198
Hello?

612
01:18:08,572 --> 01:18:10,369
-Deputy Lester Burdon?
-Yes?

613
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:12,939
This is Lt. Alvarez with lnternal Affairs.

614
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:16,104
l'd like you to dispatch yourself
to my office immediately.

615
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,410
Can't it wait till l'm back on duty, sir?

616
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:21,781
No, Deputy, it cannot.
You be in my office in 45 minutes...

617
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:24,753
or you can come in tomorrow
and drop off your badge.

618
01:18:50,948 --> 01:18:52,381
Please wait.

619
01:18:53,818 --> 01:18:56,048
Excuse for me, please.

620
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:03,751
l am sorry for keeping you to waiting.
How is your foot?

621
01:19:04,628 --> 01:19:06,220
Better, thank you.

622
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:09,629
Can l come in?

623
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:12,227
-Please, come in.
-Thank you.

624
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:20,533
l grew up in this house.

625
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:25,111
lt's the house that my father left
to me and my brother when he died.

626
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:29,616
The county evicted me
from this house by mistake.

627
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:32,385
And your husband bought it...

628
01:19:32,456 --> 01:19:36,449
and now he won't sell it back
for less than four times what he paid.

629
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:40,327
Now, l don't want to argue with him.
You know, l really don't.

630
01:19:40,397 --> 01:19:44,697
lt's just that if this goes to court,
it could take months, and--

631
01:19:44,769 --> 01:19:46,498
They are to deport us?

632
01:19:47,538 --> 01:19:49,631
-l don't know.
-You must see.

633
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:54,439
They will kill us.
They will shoot my children.

634
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,950
You don't understand a word l'm saying,
do you?

635
01:20:09,093 --> 01:20:12,119
Please, you are a very nice girl.

636
01:20:12,863 --> 01:20:15,058
Please, you write for me everything.

637
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,333
l want for to understand...

638
01:20:18,035 --> 01:20:20,503
for discussing with my husband.

639
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:01,342
You think you can frighten me?

640
01:21:01,412 --> 01:21:05,314
You think you can frighten me with your
stupid deputy coming here, telling lies.

641
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:09,546
What do you think l am? Tell me that.
Am l stupid? Do you think l'm stupid?

642
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:13,556
ln my country, you'd not be worthy
to raise your eyes to me. You are nothing!

643
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:17,685
And you can tell your deputy friend
his superior officers know everything.

644
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:19,992
You tell him that. This is our home!

645
01:21:20,064 --> 01:21:21,463
-Please.
-Our home!

646
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:25,902
Please, stop!

647
01:21:43,254 --> 01:21:45,119
-K, is that you?
-Yeah.

648
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:50,256
Mom said you sounded strange
on the phone. What's going on?

649
01:21:50,928 --> 01:21:52,293
l need help.

650
01:21:53,097 --> 01:21:55,895
-l really need some help.
-What's wrong?

651
01:21:56,734 --> 01:22:00,135
Do you think you could just
come out here? Please?

652
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,798
K, l'm sorry. l just got a real shit storm
going on over here.

653
01:22:06,911 --> 01:22:09,675
We just got the new models in.
There's inventory.

654
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:12,648
l'll be right there. Just give me a second.

655
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:17,081
l just feel lost, Frankie, you know?

656
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:19,746
l just....

657
01:22:22,259 --> 01:22:23,851
l just feel lost.

658
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:27,762
Look, Ma and the aunts will be out there
on the 18th.

659
01:22:27,831 --> 01:22:31,460
They can help you, bring you back,
straighten you out, okay?

660
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:34,429
l'm sorry, K, but l got to go, okay?

661
01:22:38,809 --> 01:22:42,336
All right, chin up, baby sister.
l'll call you later.

662
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:47,173
Don't tell Mom, all right?

663
01:22:49,286 --> 01:22:51,186
Okay, bye. Fuck.

664
01:23:27,057 --> 01:23:28,354
Pack of Royals?

665
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:30,558
Wild night?

666
01:23:31,328 --> 01:23:33,728
Seems to be heading in that direction.

667
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,826
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.

668
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:49,411
This, and three on two.

669
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,145
You need a funnel with that?

670
01:23:55,219 --> 01:23:57,847
No. Just a book of matches.

671
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:58,732
l'm sorry.

672
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:26,252
l don't want the house anymore.

673
01:27:26,797 --> 01:27:28,287
l don't care.

674
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:49,180
Don't go.

675
01:28:05,936 --> 01:28:08,496
You must sleep now. You must rest.

676
01:29:06,196 --> 01:29:08,061
Please? Some tea.

677
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:39,521
Please, have bath to relax.

678
01:30:04,788 --> 01:30:06,983
That car in the driveway,
is it that woman's?

679
01:30:07,057 --> 01:30:11,016
The woman has come here and tried
to take her own life. We must help her.

680
01:30:11,128 --> 01:30:12,959
Pesaram, she is a bird.

681
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,627
A broken one.

682
01:30:15,232 --> 01:30:20,135
Your grandfather used to say that a bird
which flies into your house is an angel.

683
01:30:20,837 --> 01:30:23,271
You must look upon his presence
as a blessing.

684
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:27,003
We have a guest in the house.
You must be a gentleman, joon-am.

685
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:30,508
Very kind. Very polite.

686
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:33,039
Very quiet.

687
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:15,509
Hello?

688
01:32:18,755 --> 01:32:20,620
Do you need anything?

689
01:32:37,741 --> 01:32:41,302
Your mouth to open. Very good.
Your mouth.

690
01:32:42,746 --> 01:32:44,373
Very good. Yes.

691
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:54,483
Very good.

692
01:32:58,562 --> 01:33:00,325
l feel sorry for her.

693
01:33:02,098 --> 01:33:04,123
We should have moved.

694
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:15,236
Yes, perhaps you're right.
We should have moved.

695
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:37,422
Put her down!

696
01:34:39,963 --> 01:34:42,761
What did you do to her?
Step back. Shut up!

697
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,766
-Listen!
-No! Move!

698
01:34:45,935 --> 01:34:47,596
Les, don't.

699
01:34:47,904 --> 01:34:49,064
Move.

700
01:34:59,282 --> 01:35:00,510
What did you do to her?

701
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,642
She took an entire bottle
of my mother's pills.

702
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,380
Bring them to me.

703
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,584
How many? When?

704
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:14,462
English!

705
01:35:16,599 --> 01:35:20,899
My wife says 20 tablets,
perhaps half an hour ago.

706
01:35:21,071 --> 01:35:24,199
My wife made her lose her stomach.
She has vomited the pills.

707
01:35:24,274 --> 01:35:27,038
She also attempted
to shoot herself with that pistol.

708
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:31,069
l discovered her with it in her automobile.
She was quite upset.

709
01:35:31,448 --> 01:35:33,939
She'd been drinking great deal.

710
01:35:36,986 --> 01:35:38,647
That's bullshit.

711
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,190
Come here.

712
01:35:43,793 --> 01:35:46,660
Pick her up. Carry her into that room.

713
01:35:53,303 --> 01:35:54,634
Carefully!

714
01:36:05,081 --> 01:36:06,446
Step away.

715
01:36:19,028 --> 01:36:20,689
She'll be okay.

716
01:36:22,899 --> 01:36:24,662
All right, come on.

717
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:33,265
l don't want to see this door move.

718
01:36:49,993 --> 01:36:51,517
Get some rest in there...

719
01:36:51,594 --> 01:36:55,462
'cause tomorrow you're selling this place
back to the county.

720
01:37:35,305 --> 01:37:36,636
Fuck.

721
01:38:12,108 --> 01:38:13,234
Yes?

722
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:16,377
-l have to go.
-Use the toilet.

723
01:38:18,414 --> 01:38:20,473
Your mother will not look.

724
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:41,036
Today l want you to pretend
to be frightened of this man.

725
01:38:41,104 --> 01:38:44,073
-You must do everything he says.
-Why?

726
01:38:44,207 --> 01:38:47,301
He is a weak man,
he is nothing without his gun.

727
01:38:49,512 --> 01:38:52,777
He's very scared,
and a scared man is dangerous.

728
01:38:54,284 --> 01:38:56,445
We will remain...

729
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,480
lions in our hearts, pesaram.

730
01:39:21,778 --> 01:39:24,269
-You're here.
-l'm here.

731
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:31,653
Sir? Please let us out
so my family can eat.

732
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:38,124
-What's going on?
-l locked them in the bathroom.

733
01:39:39,462 --> 01:39:42,124
Why? That's crazy, Les.

734
01:39:42,398 --> 01:39:45,424
No, what's crazy is trying to kill yourself.

735
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,468
Kathy, why?

736
01:39:50,506 --> 01:39:53,100
l didn't think you were coming back.

737
01:39:54,777 --> 01:39:56,369
Well, l'm back.

738
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:59,639
Do you really want to die?

739
01:40:01,985 --> 01:40:04,351
l just wanted things to change.

740
01:40:06,622 --> 01:40:09,921
You will get out
when you call the goddamn county!

741
01:40:10,326 --> 01:40:12,726
Sir, may l speak with you?

742
01:40:20,336 --> 01:40:21,325
What?

743
01:40:21,404 --> 01:40:24,965
Please open the door.
l wish to speak with you directly.

744
01:40:33,783 --> 01:40:36,411
l think l have a possible resolution.

745
01:40:36,919 --> 01:40:39,046
You and l will go
to the government office...

746
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:42,819
and l will sign the necessary papers
for returning the house to them.

747
01:40:42,892 --> 01:40:45,759
They to me will write a check for $45,000.

748
01:40:46,329 --> 01:40:49,059
This check l will give to you
and the woman...

749
01:40:49,165 --> 01:40:52,134
in exchange
for putting the house in my name.

750
01:40:55,004 --> 01:40:57,598
-You would do that?
-l would do that.

751
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,604
Wait.

752
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,884
We can't do this, Les.

753
01:41:10,019 --> 01:41:13,785
l think that this can all work out.
He signs the house to the county.

754
01:41:13,923 --> 01:41:17,791
When he gets the check, he gives it to us.
Then you sign the house back to him.

755
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:20,852
lt's wrong.
lt's just wrong to do it this way.

756
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:22,695
This has got to work.

757
01:41:22,765 --> 01:41:26,223
This way, at least you get some money.
He gets what he wants, the house.

758
01:41:26,302 --> 01:41:29,237
lt's a win-win situation. No one gets hurt.

759
01:41:29,338 --> 01:41:30,862
Let's just go.

760
01:41:32,075 --> 01:41:33,667
Please, let's just go.

761
01:41:34,944 --> 01:41:36,969
Kathy, we could use that money.

762
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,276
To start new. lt's our only choice now.

763
01:41:40,783 --> 01:41:42,614
He'll never let it happen.

764
01:41:48,091 --> 01:41:51,583
All right. Leave the keys
and go do what you promised.

765
01:41:52,395 --> 01:41:54,556
But your son stays here with me.

766
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:57,289
You're not back soon...

767
01:41:57,366 --> 01:41:59,596
lshmael and l will be gone.

768
01:41:59,769 --> 01:42:02,135
But we have made an agreement.

769
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:09,742
No, l will for you do nothing
without my son.

770
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:12,208
Nothing.

771
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,584
Shit.

772
01:42:24,393 --> 01:42:26,384
Fine. Let's just do this.

773
01:42:43,913 --> 01:42:46,848
Move it, Colonel. Come on.
You too, lshmael.

774
01:42:49,085 --> 01:42:50,780
Excuse me, Mr. Burdon?

775
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:53,921
-All right. Slow down.
-Deputy Sheriff Burdon.

776
01:42:54,257 --> 01:42:55,417
Sir?

777
01:42:56,092 --> 01:42:57,389
l know you're busy.

778
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:01,157
l just wanted to say
l appreciate everything you taught me.

779
01:43:02,165 --> 01:43:03,996
l just wanted to say thanks.

780
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:07,432
l appreciate that.
And good luck to you, Brian.

781
01:43:21,517 --> 01:43:22,814
All right.

782
01:43:23,486 --> 01:43:26,512
You listen to me. When we get in there,
you and lshmael here...

783
01:43:26,556 --> 01:43:27,386
You listen to me. When we get in there,
you and lshmael here...

784
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:31,617
you'll have to hear me a whole lot better.
You're gonna do exactly as l tell.

785
01:43:31,694 --> 01:43:32,888
Help!

786
01:43:32,995 --> 01:43:36,396
Somebody help us!
Somebody call the police, fast!

787
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:39,031
My name is Esmail...

788
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:41,159
not lshmael.

789
01:43:44,574 --> 01:43:46,667
Help, somebody call the police!

790
01:43:46,742 --> 01:43:48,175
Esmail, please!

791
01:43:48,511 --> 01:43:50,240
Drop it, now!

792
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:51,776
l said drop it!

793
01:43:52,448 --> 01:43:53,506
