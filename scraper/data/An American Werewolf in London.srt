1
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,101
That's East Proctor, and all about 'ere
are t'moors. I go this way.

2
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,539
Thanks for the ride, sir.
You have lovely sheep.

3
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,760
Boys, keep off the moors. Stick to
the roads, and the best of luck.

4
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:59,692
Thanks again. I'm gonna miss you.

5
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:01,730
Bye, girls.

6
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,905
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

7
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:10,426
Good.

8
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,769
- Jack!
- David.

9
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,345
- You're not havin' a good time, are ya?
- Oh, I don't know. I mean, look around.

10
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,897
Isn't this a fun place?

11
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:22,517
- Well, I like it here.
- Right.

12
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,745
- Northern England first. Italy later.
- Right.

13
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,679
- I mean, we've got three months.
- Right.

14
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,689
Those sheep shit on my pack.

15
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:40,129
You think she'll meet me in Rome?

16
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,747
I think Debbie Klein's a mediocre person
with a good body.

17
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,097
There's nothin' mediocre
about Debbie Klein's body.

18
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,913
She's a jerk.

19
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,065
You're talkin' about the woman I love.

20
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,235
I'm talkin' about a girl you
wanna fuck. So gimme a break?

21
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,926
Well... I have to make love to her.

22
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:02,037
It's really very simple.
She has no choice.

23
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:07,206
It just fascinates me how much energy
you spend on somebody so dull.

24
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,259
There's nothin' dull about that body.

25
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,945
We've known Debbie, what?
Since the eighth grade?

26
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,495
How many years of foreplay is that?

27
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:20,739
She says she likes me too much.

28
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,491
What are you worried about
Debbie Klein for, anyway?

29
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,768
There are gonna be plenty
of girls on this trip.

30
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,217
Yeah, we're off to a great start.

31
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,838
- Say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.

32
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,865
- Who's there?
- Who?

33
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,867
- Don't you get it?
- What?

34
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,909
You don't get that joke?
All right, I'll try another.

35
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,195
- Say "knock, knock".
- What?

36
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,248
- Say "knock, knock".
- Who's there?

37
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:48,451
- No, no, no. You say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.

38
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,148
- Who's there?
- Who?

39
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,054
- No...
- (laughter)

40
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,342
You're right, it is a pub.

41
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:26,973
Whaddaya say we go in
for a little food? Drink? Rest?

42
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,171
"The Slaughtered Lamb"?

43
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,397
That's kinda strange.

44
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,226
- Where's the lamb?
- Probably inside getting cold. Come on.

45
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,107
No, really. What kinda ad
is that for a pub?

46
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:43,381
I don't know.
Would you rather the Hilton?

47
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:48,036
All right. But, whatever happens,
it's your fault.

48
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,623
(laughter)

49
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:53,763
(laughter stops)

50
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,808
Hello.

51
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,986
Hi.

52
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,915
Nice to see you.

53
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:06,399
It's very cold outside.
May we come in?

54
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:27,774
- Do you have any hot soup?
- No.

55
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,454
- Do you have any coffee, then?
- No.

56
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,484
Do you have any, uh, hot chocolate?

57
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,605
We've spirits and beers. If it's
something hot you want, have tea.

58
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,655
- Then you have tea.
- No.

59
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,937
- Oh.
- I can make some for you, if you like.

60
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,994
Oh, yes, please.

61
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,931
- Nice-lookin' group.
- At least it's warm in here.

62
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:00,461
Look at that.

63
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,352
- What about it?
- It's a five-pointed star.

64
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,451
Maybe the owners are from Texas.

65
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,651
- Remember the Alamo.
- I beg your pardon?

66
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,811
- Oh, he was just joking.
- Joking?

67
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:18,899
I remember The Alamo. I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.

68
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:24,596
She means in the cinema...
that film with John Wayne.

69
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,345
(David) Oh, yeah, of course.

70
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,414
Checkmate.

71
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,056
Right. With Laurence Harvey.
Everybody dies in it. Very bloody.

72
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,809
Bloody awful if you ask me.

73
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,155
'Ere, Gladys, Tom.
Did you hear the one about that...?

74
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,419
(everyone groans)

75
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,869
Let me speak!

76
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,052
- Ask him what the candles are for.
- You ask him.

77
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:51,140
All right, then, I shan't tell it.
No, no, you've had your chance.

78
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:58,347
It's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.
It's used in witchcraft.

79
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:02,128
Lon Chaney Jr at Universal Studios
said that's the mark of the Wolf Man.

80
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,482
And you want me to ask them if they're
burning candles to ward off monsters.

81
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
- Right.
- Wrong.

82
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:12,534
All right, then!
There was this aeroplane...

83
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,425
..over the Atlantic
on its way to New York,...

84
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,587
..and it was full of men
from the United Nations.

85
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,962
- Go on, ask him.
- You ask him.

86
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:28,094
So halfway over the ocean
the engines run low on petrol.

87
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,825
So they have to lighten the plane.

88
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:34,015
So they heave out all the baggage,
but it's still too heavy.

89
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:38,065
So they chuck out all the seats,
but it's still too heavy.

90
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:43,524
Finally, this Frog, he steps up, shouts
"Vive la France", and leaps out.

91
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:49,778
Then an Englishman, he steps up, shouts
"God save the Queen", and he leaps out.

92
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,608
But the plane is still too heavy.

93
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:57,550
So the Yank delegate,
from Texas, he steps up, shouts:

94
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:01,598
"Remember the Alamo",
and chucks out the Mexican!

95
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,245
Remember the Alamo.

96
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:19,872
Excuse me.
What's that star on the wall for?

97
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,638
You... made me miss.

98
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,801
Sorry.

99
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,518
I've never missed that board before.

100
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:49,085
- Jack, we'd better go.
- Are you kidding? I'm starved.

101
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,262
There's no food 'ere.

102
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:54,147
(thunder)

103
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,988
- Shall we go, Jack?
- Apparently so.

104
00:10:57,225 --> 00:11:00,624
- You can't let them go.
- How much do we owe you?

105
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,015
Nothing, lads.

106
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,549
Go. God be with you.

107
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,063
Thank you.

108
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,153
Wait! You just can't let them go.

109
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,404
Go. Stay on the road.

110
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,866
Keep clear of the moors.

111
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,581
Thank you.

112
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,859
Beware the moon, lads.

113
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,611
Yeah.

114
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,865
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

115
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,854
Let's go up the road and see if
there's an inn or somethin'.

116
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,577
- "Beware the moon"?
- Yeah, Jack, but come on. I'm freezing.

117
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,491
- Where the hell are we going?
- Away from The Slaughtered Lamb.

118
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,052
Where to now, Kessler?
The Duck's Breath?

119
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,993
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sure
we'll find something else.

120
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,315
Weird fuckin' place.

121
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:54,247
It was, man.
But, boy, they could play darts.

122
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,866
You can't let them go.

123
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,599
Should the world know our business?

124
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,628
- It's murder, then!
- Then murder it is.

125
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:07,687
It's in God's hands now.

126
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:10,283
(thunder)

127
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:20,258
- What do you think was wrong?
- I have no idea.

128
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:23,915
Maybe that pentangle
was for something supernatural.

129
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:26,147
Oh, I see.

130
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:30,314
And they were too embarrassed to talk
about it because they just felt so silly.

131
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,288
- They were ashamed.
- Yeah.

132
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,862
Please, don't rain!

133
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,505
Of course.

134
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,781
Oh, David...

135
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:45,191
Yes, I'm well aware of how pleasant the
weather is in Rome at the present time.

136
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,700
# Santa Lucia

137
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:54,364
(both) # Santa Lucia

138
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,594
# Santa Lucia

139
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,773
# Santa Lucia

140
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,461
(David) It's-a cold and-a wet out here!

141
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,820
Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain.

142
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:15,575
No one brought them 'ere.
No one wanted them 'ere.

143
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,019
- (barmaid) You could've told them.
- Are you daft?

144
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,403
And what do you think they'd say?

145
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,417
They'd think us mad.

146
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,973
(distant howl)

147
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,446
Listen.

148
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,713
Do you hear it?

149
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,553
We must go to them.

150
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,866
I heard nothing.

151
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,898
(distant howl)

152
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,373
Nor I.

153
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,599
(howling)

154
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,618
Did you hear that?

155
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,341
- I heard that.
- What was it?

156
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,038
Could be a lot of things.

157
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,043
Yeah?

158
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,045
- A coyote.
- There aren't any coyotes in England.

159
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,533
- The hound of the Baskervilles?
- Pecos Bill?

160
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,553
- Heathcliff.
- Heathcliff didn't howl.

161
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,875
No, but he was on the moors.

162
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,893
It's a full moon.

163
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,934
- (both) Beware the moon.
- And stick to the road.

164
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,423
Oops.

165
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,958
(howling)

166
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,544
I vote we go back
to The Slaughtered Lamb.

167
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,574
Yeah.

168
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,895
Hey, wait a minute. We're lost.

169
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,039
- (howling)
- Ah, shit, David. What is that?

170
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,410
- I don't know. Come on.
- Come on where?

171
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:54,225
Anywhere. I think we should
just keep moving.

172
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,971
(growling)

173
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:12,254
It's moving.

174
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,521
It's circling us.

175
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,531
Ah, fuck.

176
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,744
- What's the plan?
- Plan?

177
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,786
Let's just keep walkin'.

178
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,724
That's right.
A lovely stroll on the moors.

179
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,590
# Tra-la-la-la-la

180
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:28,985
Isn't this fun?

181
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,002
(growling)

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
It's in front of us.

183
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,551
Do you think it's a dog?

184
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:42,015
Oh, shit. What is it?

185
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,737
It's a sheepdog or somethin'.
Come on. Turn slowly. Let's walk away.

186
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,732
Nice doggie. Good boy.

187
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,373
Come on, Jack. Walk away.

188
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,637
Walking away. Yes.
Here we are, walking away.

189
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,472
- Can you see anything?
- No.

190
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,493
(growling)

191
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,812
- Sounds far away.
- Not far enough. Come on.

192
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,671
But, Jack, where are we going?

193
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,664
- I'll tell you when we get there.
- OK, cos... Arghhh!

194
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,879
You really scared me, you shithead.

195
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,160
You gonna help me up or what?

196
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,854
(ferocious growl)

197
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,890
Jesus! Jesus! Fuck!

198
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,568
Jesus! Fuck! Oh, God! Help! Help!

199
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:28,634
(snarling/screaming)

200
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,543
Jack...

201
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,234
Jack...

202
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,962
(ferocious growl)

203
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,103
Jack?

204
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:34,604
Mr Kessler?

205
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,054
Mr Kessler?

206
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,888
I'm going to look into your eyes.

207
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:45,381
(door opens)

208
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,710
- Is he all right?
- Yes, I should think.

209
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,437
He called out just now.

210
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:55,919
He's American. Dr Hirsch is gonna fetch
one of them embassy fellas to see him.

211
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:59,306
- His chart says he's from New York.
- I think he's a Jew.

212
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:02,322
- What makes you say that?
- I've had a look.

213
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:05,245
Really, Susan,
that wasn't very proper.

214
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,285
Besides, it's common practice now.

215
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,848
Nurse Gallagher,
Nurse Price is quite right.

216
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:13,915
Dr Hirsch,
Mr Kessler called out just now.

217
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,761
Nurse Gallagher, surely you perform
some function here at the hospital?

218
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:21,163
- Yes, Doctor.
- Then get on with it.

219
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,496
Yes, Doctor.

220
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,889
Can I be of service, Nurse Price?

221
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,020
- Dr Hirsch?
- Go about your duties.

222
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,070
Yes, Doctor.

223
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,633
- Oh, Nurse Price.
- Yes, Doctor?

224
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,937
- What exactly did he call out?
- He said "Jack".

225
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:50,956
That would be Jack Goodman,
the boy who was killed.

226
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,025
What happened to them?

227
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:56,321
The police report said they were
attacked by an escaped lunatic.

228
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,778
Must've been a very powerful man.

229
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:04,330
Although I don't see that it's
any concern of yours, Nurse Price.

230
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:06,946
No, sir. Of course, sir.

231
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,066
Good day, Doctor.

232
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,500
(footfalls/leaves rustling)

233
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,160
(Dr Hirsch) Hello, David.

234
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:42,075
I'm Dr Hirsch. This is a countryman
of yours - Mr Collins.

235
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,317
- Where am I?
- You're in hospital in London.

236
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,223
London?

237
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,547
Where's Jack?

238
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,442
David, I'd like you to prepare yourself.

239
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,592
Your friend is dead.

240
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:03,105
What?

241
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,951
Ow. Shit.

242
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,336
Jack is dead?

243
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,903
Hi. I'm Mr Collins of the American
Embassy here in Grosvenor Square.

244
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:18,107
Mr Goodman's parents and your parents
have been notified of your injuries,...

245
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,688
..and everything's in order.

246
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,963
Who are you people?

247
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,366
What's goin' on here? Where's Jack?
Get your hands off me.

248
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:30,278
- Let go of me. I wanna see Jack!
- Nurse!

249
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,136
- I wanna see Jack.
- Mr Kessler!

250
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:38,343
I appreciate how upsetting this must
be for you. Please, Mr Kessler!

251
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,800
Twenty milligrams... IV, please.

252
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:44,857
I appreciate how upset you are,
but this is no reason for hysterics.

253
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:49,561
Mr Kessler? Mr Kessler,
try not to excite yourself.

254
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:53,723
I shall check on your progress and
send a report to your parents.

255
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,546
The police have requested
to interview you.

256
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,943
I have given them
permission to do so.

257
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,680
Thank you very much,
Mr Collins. He'll rest now.

258
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,752
I'm sure everything
will be fine once he's adjusted.

259
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,159
He's had quite a shock.

260
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:10,294
These dumb-ass kids. They never
appreciate anything you do for 'em.

261
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,698
How long have I been here?

262
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:18,002
You've been unconscious since
you were brought in three weeks ago.

263
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,860
- Three weeks?
- You've suffered some cuts and bruises.

264
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:25,257
Lost a little blood. Nothing serious.
Black and blue for a while.

265
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,521
You'll have some duelling scars
to boast of.

266
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,092
That lunatic must've been a fierce fellow.

267
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,556
They say a madman has
the strength of ten.

268
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,297
Lunatic?

269
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,767
We've given you
a strong sedative. Rest now.

270
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:41,149
Nurse Price will see to
all your needs. You rest.

271
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:45,607
- It wasn't a lunatic.
- I beg your pardon?

272
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:48,244
- It was an animal.
- What?

273
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:51,939
A wolf.

274
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,108
Did he say a wolf?

275
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:57,418
Yes... I believe he did.

276
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,400
Oh, I'm sure I shall.

277
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:05,916
If I survived Rommel, I can survive
an excruciating evening with Matheson.

278
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,529
Be a good girl. Bye, now.

279
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,924
(intercom)

280
00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:17,074
Yes?

281
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,718
Inspector Villiers and Sergeant
McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

282
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,793
Send them in.

283
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:26,787
- Dr Hirsch.
- Come in. Come in. Please sit down.

284
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:30,298
- Some tea?
- No, thank you.

285
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,820
I'd like some tea, please.

286
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,524
Uh, maybe not. No, thanks. Maybe later.

287
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:39,266
- No problem.
- No, thank you, Doctor.

288
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:42,205
Well, then, what can I do
for Scotland Yard?

289
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:47,088
We understand the Kessler boy
has regained consciousness.

290
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:50,359
Uh, sorry. Sorry.

291
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,802
Has Mr Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?

292
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,226
- (intercom)
- Excuse me. Yes?

293
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:59,324
- Roger Matheson, Doctor.
- I'm not here.

294
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:00,612
He's on the telephone.

295
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:03,742
Tell him I'm out. Tell him I've
passed away - an old war wound.

296
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,234
(clattering)

297
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,538
Just tell him I'm dead!
And no more calls.

298
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,144
(clattering)

299
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,090
I'm sorry if I conflict
with your report, Inspector,...

300
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:37,435
..but Jack and I were not
attacked by a man!

301
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,250
- Hmm. So you've said.
- He may have a point, sir.

302
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:44,896
Two strong boys would be able to defend
themselves against one man.

303
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:46,401
Sergeant McManus,...

304
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:49,896
..are you suggesting that David and Jack
were attacked by some animal,...

305
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:54,524
..and that the officialdom of East Proctor
has conspired to keep it a secret?

306
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:58,476
We've an autopsy report on the murderer,
shot in the act by the local police.

307
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:00,796
We have two witnesses to the crime.

308
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:04,843
You'll forgive me, Mr Kessler,
if I consider your testimony...

309
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,935
..as coming from someone who
has gone through a terrible shock.

310
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,343
Inspector, the boy seems
all right to me, and...

311
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,479
And what, Sergeant?

312
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:17,848
- And I don't rightly know, sir.
- That is precisely my point.

313
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,959
David, as far as we're concerned,
the matter is now closed.

314
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,236
We will trouble you no further.
Good day. Doctor.

315
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,560
- There were witnesses?
- So they said.

316
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,037
How could there have been witnesses?
It was so dark.

317
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:37,892
We were running, and I fell.

318
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:40,888
Jack went to help me,
and this thing came from nowhere.

319
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:43,731
I don't know what they're talkin' about.

320
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:46,660
In time I'm sure
it'll all come back to you.

321
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:51,735
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity
I'm beginning to worry about.

322
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,892
- Hello, Benjamin.
- No.

323
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,908
- No what?
- No.

324
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,828
Well, all right, then, be like that.
Here. Swallow this.

325
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,666
Want some water?

326
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,407
- Feeling better?
- No!

327
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,032
What a lot of lovely comics
you've got.

328
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,455
- Do you like them?
- No.

329
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,474
Right.

330
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,082
How's the patient in 21?

331
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:17,829
- Yes, yes, yes.
- How did he look?

332
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,301
What do you mean?

333
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,561
Does he seem depressed?
Will he eat his food?

334
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:25,373
I am an orderly, not a bleeding
psychiatrist. I push things around.

335
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,972
- What happens then I don't know.
- Thank you.

336
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:45,537
- Mr Kessler.
- Yes?

337
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:51,726
- You haven't eaten your lunch.
- Well, I'm not very hungry, thank you.

338
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,350
- I'm afraid you have to eat something.
- What?

339
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,558
You have to eat something.

340
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:01,930
No, really. Thanks. I'm not hungry.

341
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,707
You put me in an awkward position,
Mr Kessler.

342
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:09,906
How'd I do that?

343
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:11,873
You're to take these after you've eaten.

344
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:15,955
What sort of nurse would I be if I failed
in so simple a task as handing out pills?

345
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,836
- Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
- Sorry.

346
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:27,734
- Aw, come on, Nurse Price.
- You can call me Alex.

347
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:30,044
Come on, Alex.

348
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:34,006
Shall I be forced
to feed you, Mr Kessler?

349
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,200
You can call me David.

350
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:40,074
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

351
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:44,959
This is absurd. I'm not hungry.
I don't want any food.

352
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:47,577
Right.

353
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,937
Let's try a little harder, shall we?

354
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,129
Would you gimme a break?

355
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:25,691
Will I have to take such drastic
action again, David?

356
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,682
You've never had bad dreams before?

357
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:01,848
Sure, as a kid, but never so real.
Never so weird.

358
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,843
Did you get a good look
at the man who attacked you?

359
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:07,702
Doctor, I told you. It wasn't a man.

360
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,781
It was an animal.
A big wolf or something.

361
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:14,877
- A rabid dog.
- Let's have a look, shall we?

362
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:19,525
Dr Hirsch, I know I was traumatised,
but Jack was torn apart.

363
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:24,027
I saw him. A man can't do that
to someone with his bare hands.

364
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,250
You'd be surprised what horrors
a man is capable of.

365
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,901
- Did you see Jack?
- No.

366
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:32,930
In fact, your wounds had been dressed
before you arrived here.

367
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,379
Did you talk to the police
in East Proctor?

368
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:37,794
Did the cops go to
The Slaughtered Lamb?

369
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,331
I really don't know.

370
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,032
Then why the hell are you
so quick to disbelieve me?

371
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:46,889
- You think I'm crazy.
- David, please. The police are satisfied.

372
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:52,268
And if there were a monster roaming
around, we'd have seen it on the telly.

373
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:58,835
You'll be leaving this hospital in three
or four days. Please, remain sane.

374
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,140
At least until you're
no longer our responsibility.

375
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,532
Dr Hirsch.

376
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,169
I'd rather not be by myself.

377
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:12,211
I'll send someone in
to keep you company.

378
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:39,593
You're a very beautiful girl.

379
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,543
I thought you were asleep.

380
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,252
I was.

381
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,222
Shall I read to you?

382
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,393
Yeah, OK.

383
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,298
A Connecticut Yankee
at King Arthur's Court.

384
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:58,706
By Samuel L Clemens.

385
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,367
This is after the preface
but before chapter one:

386
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:04,294
"A Word of Explanation."

387
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,275
"It was in Warwick Castle that I came
across the curious stranger...

388
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:10,039
..who I'm going to talk about."

389
00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:13,510
"He attracted me by three things:
his candid simplicity,...

390
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,934
..his marvellous familiarity
with ancient armour,...

391
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,671
..and the restfulness of his company,
for he did all the talking."

392
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,788
"We fell together,
as modest people will,...

393
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,350
..in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through,...

394
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:28,417
..and he at once began to say things
which interested me."

395
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:30,888
Puppetry is an art form, Piggy.

396
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:34,523
- You call that violence "art"?
- Well, violence belongs with puppetry.

397
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:35,756
He is hitting her.

398
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:37,760
That's Punch andJudy.
They've always been violent.

399
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,446
- Punch andJudy?
- It's a good, aggressive behaviour.

400
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,077
Better than my act?

401
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,302
(knocking at door)

402
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:46,673
(Punch) I was going to bite you
very badly.

403
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,730
- Get the door!
- (knocking)

404
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:54,151
I'll get it.

405
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:55,757
(knocking)

406
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:57,701
All right, all right.
Hold your horses.

407
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,300
- (knocking)
- All right, already.

408
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,298
Stop!

409
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:12,612
Ladies and gentlemen...

410
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,693
(screaming)

411
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:41,465
Hello. Have you been up long?

412
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,550
I've just had a nightmare.

413
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:47,462
Not to worry. I've just the thing.

414
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,058
Alex!

415
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:01,371
Holy shit.

416
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:12,273
Ah, you're up? Good morning,
and a good day to you.

417
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
We have quite a meal here
for you: bacon and eggs,...

418
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:18,093
..porridge, orange juice,
and toast and jam.

419
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:22,796
Good stuff there. You eat it up, and I'll
be back for the dishes when you finish.

420
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,137
Good morning.

421
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,499
Can I have a piece of toast?

422
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:47,028
Get the fuck outta here, Jack.

423
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:49,221
Thanks a lot.

424
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,537
No. I can't take this.

425
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:56,171
Am I asleep now, or awake or what?

426
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:58,755
I realise I don't look so hot, David,...

427
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,460
..but I thought you'd be glad to see me.

428
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:06,851
David! You're hurting my feelings.

429
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:09,274
Hurting your feelings?

430
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:11,851
Has it occurred to you
that it might be unsettling...

431
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:14,438
..to see you rise from the grave
to visit me?

432
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:18,436
Sorry to be upsetting you,
David, but I had to come.

433
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:21,886
Aren't you supposed to be
buried someplace in New York?

434
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,530
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral.

435
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,602
I was surprised at how many came.

436
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:30,882
Why should you be surprised?
You were a well-liked person.

437
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:33,459
- Yeah. I was, wasn't I?
- Well, I liked you.

438
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,269
Debbie Klein cried a lot.

439
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:38,437
Am I asleep now or what?

440
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,767
So you know what she does?

441
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:45,582
She's so grief-stricken she runs to find
solace in Mark Levine's bed.

442
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,319
Mark Levine?

443
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:52,051
An asshole.
Life mocks me even in death.

444
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:55,611
I'm going completely crazy.

445
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,480
David!

446
00:34:58,665 --> 00:34:59,587
What?

447
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,859
I'm really sorry to be upsetting you,
but I have to warn you.

448
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:08,145
- Warn me?
- We were attacked by a werewolf.

449
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:10,464
- I'm not listening to this.
- On the moors.

450
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:14,918
We were attacked by a lycanthrope.
A werewolf.

451
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:18,184
I was murdered.
An unnatural death.

452
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:22,555
And now I walk the earth in limbo
until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

453
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:27,258
- Shut up.
- The wolf's bloodline must be severed.

454
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:31,490
The last remaining werewolf
must be destroyed.

455
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,484
It's you, David.

456
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:38,706
What?

457
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:42,113
Please believe me. You'll kill people.

458
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:44,657
- Nurse!
- Listen to me!

459
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,319
Nurse!

460
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:50,825
The supernatural, the power
of darkness... it's all true.

461
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,107
The undead surround me.

462
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,928
Have you ever talked to a corpse?

463
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,781
It's boring.

464
00:35:57,976 --> 00:35:59,936
I'm lonely.

465
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,293
Take your life, David.

466
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:05,522
Kill yourself,...

467
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,532
..before you kill others.

468
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,365
Please don't cry.

469
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,974
(David crying)

470
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,847
Beware the moon, David.

471
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,763
David... David!

472
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,432
David, what's wrong?

473
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,499
I'm a werewolf.

474
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,944
A werewolf?

475
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,087
Are you all right now?

476
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:52,369
I don't know. I'll let you know
the next full moon.

477
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:56,902
David, you're going to be discharged
tomorrow. Will you be all right?

478
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:59,002
My friend Jack was just here.

479
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:03,394
- Your dead friend Jack?
- Yes.

480
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:08,421
He told me that... I will become
a monster in two days.

481
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:11,806
What do you think?

482
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:13,808
What do I think?

483
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,010
About the possibility of you becoming
a monster in two days, or...

484
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:18,944
..about visits from dead friends?

485
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,276
I was dreaming again?

486
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,607
Yes, I would think so.

487
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,280
I think so too.

488
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:40,665
Do you have somewhere
to stay in London?

489
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:45,461
Remember, I'm just a working girl,
so don't expect too much.

490
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:49,068
- Do you live by yourself?
- Yes.

491
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,059
Good.

492
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:56,926
There's a shop on the corner.
We'll get some food.

493
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,168
This stuff's expensive.

494
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,517
It's outrageous. My pay can't possibly
keep up with inflation.

495
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:14,657
How do you live?

496
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,022
Carefully.

497
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:19,383
This is the, uh... living room.

498
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:23,840
- You mind if I get rid of this?
- Oh, please.

499
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:38,267
- The kitchen.
- Very nice.

500
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:43,618
Closet.

501
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,583
Charming.

502
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,717
The bathroom.

503
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,477
Lovely.

504
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:00,052
The bedroom.

505
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:03,310
There's only one bed.

506
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,417
I'll be perfectly honest
with you, David.

507
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:12,083
I'm not in the habit of bringing home
stray, young American men.

508
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:14,925
I should hope not.

509
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:18,676
I find you very attractive,...

510
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:21,023
..and a little bit sad.

511
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:22,918
Go on.

512
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:29,535
I've had seven lovers in my life,
three of which were one-night stands.

513
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:32,687
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

514
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:39,454
Perhaps you'd like to watch telly
whilst I take a shower.

515

(# "Moondance" by Van Morrison)

516
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:51,424
# Well, it's a marvellous night
for a Moondance

517
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:55,247
# With the stars up above
in your eyes

518
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,284
# A fantabulous night
to make romance

519
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:02,246
# 'Neath the cover
of October skies

520
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,571
# And all the leaves
on the trees are falling

521
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:09,266
# To the sound
of the breezes that blow

522
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:12,339
# And I'm trying to please
to the calling

523
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:16,423
# Ofyour heartstrings
that play soft and low

524
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:23,471
# And all the night's magic
seems to whisper and hush

525
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:28,806
# And all the soft moonlight
seems to shine

526
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:30,941
# In your blush

527
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:35,823

one more Moondance with you

528
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:37,947
# My love

529
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:42,988
# Can Ijust make
some more romance with you

530
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,680

(piano solo)

532
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:55,399
(saxophone)

533
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:18,783
Arghh!

534
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:23,125
You're not real.

535
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:25,619
Don't be a putz, David.

536
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:27,640
Come here.

537
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:34,480
A nurse, huh?

538
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:37,543
Shh.

539
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:39,325
Come on.

540
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,044
What are you doing here?

541
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:07,133
I wanted to see you.

542
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:09,903
- (high-pitched) Hi, David.
- Put that down.

543
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:15,661
OK, you've seen me. Now go away.

544
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:21,117
I'm sorry I'm upsetting you, David, but
you don't understand what's goin' on.

545
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:23,288
I understand all right.

546
00:44:23,482 --> 00:44:26,241
You're one of the "undead",
and I'm a werewolf.

547
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,110
Yes. That's right.

548
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,360
Get outta here, Jack.

549
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:35,849
Tomorrow night's the full moon.

550
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:38,517
You're gonna change. You'll become...

551
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:42,466
I know. I know. A monster.

552
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:48,296
You've gotta kill yourself,
David, before it's too late.

553
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:56,604
Are you really dead, Jack?

554
00:44:57,682 --> 00:45:01,482
- What do you think?
- I think I've lost my mind.

555
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,931
I think you're not real. I think you're just
another part of a bad dream.

556
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,670
You've gotta believe me, David.

557
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:12,901
Believe what? That tomorrow night
beneath the full moon...

558
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:15,515
..I'll sprout hair and fangs
and eat people?

559
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:19,982
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn it, David, please believe me.

560
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,770
You'll kill and make others like me.

561
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,839
I'm not havin' a nice time here.

562
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:29,681
You've gotta take your own life.

563
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:35,152
I will not accept this. Go away.

564
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,309
David?

565
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:42,441
This is not pretend, David.

566
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:45,444
I will not be threatened
by a walking meat loaf!

567
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,721
David...

568
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:53,744
What's wrong? I heard voices.

569
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:56,828
It was just me, Alex.
Just me being crazy.

570
00:45:57,826 --> 00:45:59,865
Are you all right?

571
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,037
No, I don't think so.

572
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,196
Come back to bed now.

573
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:11,733
Do I seem crazy to you?

574
00:46:11,964 --> 00:46:14,125
David, what is the matter?

575
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:17,292
I just saw Jack again.

576
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,552
Where? Here?

577
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,778
Yeah.

578
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,979
What did he say?

579
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:30,796
He said that tomorrow
I'll turn into a monster.

580
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,901
Do you believe him?

581
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:37,371
Do you believe me?

582
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:41,608
I believe that you're very upset.

583
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,750
I believe that you loved him very much
and you blame yourself for his death.

584
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:52,077
Did you ever see The Wolf Man?

585
00:46:52,296 --> 00:46:54,978
- Is that the one with Oliver Reed?
- No, the old one.

586
00:46:55,217 --> 00:46:56,416
I don't think so.

587
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:01,650
Bela Lugosi bites Lon Chaney Jr
and he turns into a werewolf.

588
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:05,172
- Why are you telling me this?
- No, listen.

589
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:09,675
Claude Rains is Lon Chaney's father,
and he ends up killing him.

590
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,781
So?

591
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:17,930
Well, I think that a werewolf can only be
killed by someone who loves them.

592
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,199
What are you talking about?

593
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,509
I don't know what I'm talkin' about.

594
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:31,452
I'm torn between feeling
very sorry for you...

595
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:34,312
..and finding you terribly attractive.

596
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:40,546
(thunder)

597
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,092
A drink for a very cold man.

598
00:48:57,296 --> 00:49:00,258
- Good afternoon. What can I get you?
- Uh...

599
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:03,269
- A Campari soda would do very nice.
- Sorry, love.

600
00:49:09,184 --> 00:49:13,224
Oh, well then, uh,
a small Guinness will suffice.

601
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:21,258
Nasty business with those two young
American boys, wasn't it?

602
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:25,593
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm right.

603
00:49:25,868 --> 00:49:28,467
A few weeks back.
Last full moon, wasn't it?

604
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,680
I mean, the escaped lunatic,
the one who killed the boy.

605
00:49:32,957 --> 00:49:35,277
A thousand thanks, madam.

606
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:39,210
Well, that was round here, wasn't it?

607
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:41,383
Where are you from, sir?

608
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,979
London.

609
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:45,857
Excuse me.

610
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,691
Knight takes pawn, hm?

611
00:49:52,351 --> 00:49:54,033
What?

612
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:56,097
Oh. Yeah.

613
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:01,843
Cheers.

614
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:10,935
What's that?

615
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,040
Oh, that's, uh...
been there for 200 years, sir.

616
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:19,614
We were going to paint it out,
but it's traditional, so we left it.

617
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:21,967
I see.

618
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,909
So, you've heard nothing of this incident?

619
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:30,052
- Incident?
- The murder.

620
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:32,224
(thunder)

621
00:50:33,894 --> 00:50:36,735
- You a police officer?
- Oh, good Lord, no.

622
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:41,989
I'm a doctor. I work in the hospital
where they brought the Kessler boy.

623
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,159
He was talking about werewolves.
Monsters.

624
00:50:47,032 --> 00:50:48,832
I was in the area, so I thought...

625
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:51,714
You thought what?

626
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:54,315
I thought I'd look
into the boy's story.

627
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,000
Story about werewolves?

628
00:50:58,044 --> 00:51:00,404
Really, sir.

629
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:09,537
Like a game?

630
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:12,662
- Well?
- I think not.

631
00:51:13,223 --> 00:51:17,865
- Surely I'm not that impressive.
- No. No, sir, you're not.

632
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:20,748
I don't feel like a game.

633
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:26,590
- You off now?
- Aye. I'll not be long.

634
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:30,880
- I just wanna check on the dogs.
- Dogs are fine.

635
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:35,665
I'll just check.

(thunder)

638
00:51:47,468 --> 00:51:50,666
Quite a long drive to London.
Do you have anything to eat?

639
00:51:50,928 --> 00:51:52,809
No. There's no food here.

640
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:55,712
There's nothing for you 'ere, sir.

641
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,696
Well,...

642
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,031
..I'll be on my way, then.

643
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:12,742

644
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:36,148
Hello.

645
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:40,957
Listen. That boy's in danger.

646
00:52:42,314 --> 00:52:44,515
I mean,...

647
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:47,813
..it were a mistake...
to let him leave 'ere.

648
00:52:50,446 --> 00:52:52,688
There's something wrong
with this place.

649
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:54,749
That much I understand.

650
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,688
It's the one who lives.

651
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:01,072
He's the one who's in danger,
and not just him.

652
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,481
Others will be, too.

653
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:09,601
It's almost full moon.

654
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,401
He'll change, and he'll...

655
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:14,197
That's enough!

656
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,898
That's enough.

657
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:23,845
(thunder)

658
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,181
If you get too anxious,
call me at the hospital, OK?

659
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:40,372
OK.

660
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:43,339
- I've left those pills for you.
- A doper werewolf.

661
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:45,302
I'm off.

662
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,346
See ya later.

663
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:54,265

(laughter continues)

666
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:11,695
Thanks a lot, dog.

667
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:24,976
Hello?

00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,180

..lost 28 pounds in less than a fortnight.

673

Rab Smith... neat, dapper little character.

674
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,201
There's a lot said about big,
gross darts players, but Rab...

675
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:52,792
Crazy girl asked me to meet
her guy before she married him,...

676
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:55,007
..and he totally blew my mind.

Nina Carter reveals her amazing life as
pop star, beauty queen and top model.

Read about her nude pictures.

00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:02,719
The only ones I regret
were among the first.

680
00:56:02,931 --> 00:56:03,971
The men in her life.

681
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,221
There may have been a lot,
but I don't regret one of them.

682
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:08,395
Nina tells the News of the World
how she had fun...

683
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:11,403
..and found trouble earning too much
money, getting in too much mischief.

684
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:13,446
In the end it nearly destroyed me.

685
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:15,529
Don't miss the naked truth
about naughty Nina,...

686
00:56:15,735 --> 00:56:18,056
..starting in the News
of the World tomorrow.

I was in East Proctor today.

- I'm concerned about David.
- Yes, sir.

There's a full moon.
Where is he?

769
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:29,033
- He's at my flat.
- What's the number?

770
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:31,172
- I'm off at midnight...
- Your number.

771
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:48,271
Is that you, Harry?

772
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:00,640
(ringing)

773
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:10,766
- No, he's not there.
- He's not?

774
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:15,205
Alex,...

775
01:04:15,426 --> 01:04:18,903
..has David persisted
in his werewolf fantasies?

776
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:22,448
Dr Hirsch, what's wrong?
Is this more serious than I know?

777
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:26,649
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records.

778
01:04:26,935 --> 01:04:31,495
Case was closed.
Now they've "misplaced" the file.

779
01:04:31,815 --> 01:04:34,737
David's lacerations were dressed
before he arrived here.

780
01:04:34,986 --> 01:04:38,305
Yet, supposedly, no other doctor
examined him before I did.

781
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:40,973
The Goodman boy's in the ground.
He's no use to us.

782
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,440
So, I went to the pub
in East Proctor today,...

783
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,820
..where I was convinced of two things:

784
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:50,997
They were lying. There were no
witnesses, no escaped lunatic.

785
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:54,175
The whole community is hiding
the truth of what actually happened.

786
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:56,509
Surely you don't mean...

787
01:04:58,008 --> 01:05:00,529
David has suffered a severe trauma.

788
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:05,240
I myself witnessed some form of
mass neurosis in East Proctor.

789
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:08,878
If the villagers believe Jack Goodman
was killed by a werewolf,...

790
01:05:09,144 --> 01:05:10,386
..why shouldn't David?

791
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:14,282
And if he survived
an attack by a werewolf,...

792
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:18,006
..wouldn't he himself become a werewolf
at the next full moon?

793
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:22,678
Oh, I don't mean running about on
all fours and howling at the moon,...

794
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:26,471
..but in such a deranged state he might
harm himself. Perhaps other people.

795
01:05:27,038 --> 01:05:30,638
- What shall we do?
- I think we should call the police.

796
01:05:33,545 --> 01:05:36,063
(distant horn)

797
01:05:36,296 --> 01:05:38,096
(chuckling)

798
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:51,430
(dog whimpers)

799
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:56,258
Here. Old Winston smells something.

800
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,818
Let him go!

801
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:08,059
Brave dog, that.

802
01:06:08,245 --> 01:06:10,565
Here! Who's there?

803
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,310
(distant howl)

804
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:16,141
That's not Winston.

805
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:20,784
Look! There!

806
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:25,852
Mary, mother of God!

807
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,360
(distant growl)

808
01:07:16,772 --> 01:07:18,733
(distant growl)

809
01:07:18,942 --> 01:07:21,340
Hello?

810
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:23,448
Is there someone there?

811
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:29,821
(growl)

812
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:32,634
I can assure you this is
not the least bit amusing.

813
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:37,431
I shall report this.

814
01:08:11,077 --> 01:08:13,077
(snarling)

815
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,958
Good Lord.

816
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:22,510
(snarling)

817
01:09:15,726 --> 01:09:16,724
(roaring)

818
01:09:18,851 --> 01:09:19,972
(trumpeting)

819
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,964
(growling)

820
01:10:06,358 --> 01:10:09,558
Uh, hello, wolves. Uh, nice wolves.

821
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,740
Um, I'm gonna, uh...
I'll be right back, OK?

822
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:15,830
Just, uh, take any calls.

823
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:18,037
Uh... Oh, boy.

824
01:10:29,089 --> 01:10:32,449
No, Dr Hirsch.
He hasn't come back yet.

825
01:10:32,718 --> 01:10:34,518
Yes, I will.

826
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,119
But I feel so helpless just
sitting around here doing nothing.

827
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:42,315
Yes, thank you.

828
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,560
Bye-bye.

829
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,280
Excuse me.

830
01:11:19,849 --> 01:11:20,929
Hey, kid!

831
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,581
Little boy with the balloons!

832
01:11:27,147 --> 01:11:28,227
Come over here!

833
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:32,579
If you come over here,
I'll give you a pound.

834
01:11:33,946 --> 01:11:35,027
Two pounds.

835
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:44,886
I don't know who you are.

836
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:47,930
I'm, uh, the famous balloon thief.

837
01:11:48,168 --> 01:11:51,368
Why would a thief want to
give me two pounds?

838
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:52,949
I'll explain it to you.

839
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,448
Thank you.

840
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:10,408
Yes, love?

841
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:13,328
A naked American man stole my balloons.

842
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:14,569
What?

843
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:26,443
Twenty pence, please, sir.

844
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,465
Sorry.

845
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,210
(whistling)

846
01:13:00,657 --> 01:13:03,177
Lot of weather we've been having lately.

847
01:13:26,265 --> 01:13:28,387
Good morning!

848
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:33,161
- I'm freezing.
- David!

849
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:37,192
Where on earth have you been?

850
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:40,245
Alex, you won't believe this.

851
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:45,694
I've lost my mind.
I woke up in the zoo.

852
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:48,938
- The zoo.
- What did I do last night?

853
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:50,811
You don't remember?

854
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:53,520
Well, I remember seeing you
to the door, and then, uh,...

855
01:13:53,753 --> 01:13:56,273
..saying goodbye,
getting locked out of the flat...

856
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:59,345
Then I came in through the front window.
I started to read,...

857
01:13:59,591 --> 01:14:01,390
..then I woke up naked at the zoo.

858
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:05,194
I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

859
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:08,987
Where did you get that coat?

860
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:12,539
(phone rings)

861
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,289
I'll get it.

862
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:18,059
- Hello?
- Alex. Have you heard anything?

863
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:22,382
- He's here.
- Is he all right? Where was he?

864
01:14:22,822 --> 01:14:24,863
He doesn't remember.
He woke up at the zoo.

865
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:27,168
The zoo? Is he rational?

866
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:30,499
Yes, he is.
He's very excited and confused.

867
01:14:30,749 --> 01:14:33,427
But he's not crazy,
if that's what you mean.

868
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:37,603
Have you read the papers today?
Listened to the radio or television?

869
01:14:37,881 --> 01:14:40,240
- No. Why?
- Is David behaving strangely?

870
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:46,816
Uh... no, he's... Not really.

871
01:14:47,097 --> 01:14:49,898
He's rather enthusiastic.

872
01:14:51,226 --> 01:14:54,587
- Can you get here without any trouble?
- Yes, I should think so.

873
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:58,225
Bring David here straight away.
I want him in my care.

874
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:01,964
I'll notify the police, but it's imperative
you bring him to the hospital.

875
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:04,078
- You understand?
- Yes, Doctor.

876
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:09,362
- You're certain he's lucid?
- He's fine. We'll come right over.

877
01:15:09,704 --> 01:15:13,304
- Shall I send a car?
- A taxi will be faster.

878
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,424
I expect you shortly.

879
01:15:18,922 --> 01:15:22,281
- We should be able to get a taxi here.
- I should be committed.

880
01:15:22,549 --> 01:15:24,991
Dr Hirsch will know what to do.

881
01:15:25,636 --> 01:15:28,435
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

882
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,160
My body feels great.
I feel like an athlete.

883
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,832
- Let's go back for a quickie, huh?
- Later.

884
01:15:35,646 --> 01:15:37,165
Good morning!

885
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:39,695
- Get in.
- No, I just...

886
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:46,725
- St Martin's Hospital.
- Right.

887
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:53,528
Puts you in mind of the days of the old
demon barber of Fleet Street, don't it?

888
01:15:53,832 --> 01:15:55,832
- Sorry?
- The murders.

889
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:58,442
- What murders?
- Haven't you heard?

890
01:15:59,504 --> 01:16:01,303
Last night,...

891
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,820
..six of 'em.

892
01:16:04,008 --> 01:16:07,327
All in different parts
of the city, all mutilated.

893
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:10,569
He must be a real right maniac,
this fella.

894
01:16:11,098 --> 01:16:13,019
- Pull over.
- David, we're...

895
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:14,747
Pull over!

896
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:18,862
Pay the man.

897
01:16:19,064 --> 01:16:20,585
Wait!

898
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,580
David!

899
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:28,181
- David, stop!
- I'm goin' to the police!

900
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:30,526
- Jack was right!
- Jack is dead!

901
01:16:30,743 --> 01:16:32,663
Jack is dead.
And six people are dead.

902
01:16:32,869 --> 01:16:35,192
There's a full moon tonight.
I'm goin' to the cops.

903
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:38,213
David, please be rational.
Let's go to Dr Hirsch.

904
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:42,258
Be rational, sure. I'm a fuckin' werewolf,
for Christ's sake!

905
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:44,626
- David!
- Officer!

906
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,615
Officer, I killed those people last night.

907
01:16:48,845 --> 01:16:50,963
- You did, did you?
- He's playing a silly joke...

908
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,180
- You be quiet.
- We had an argument...

909
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:55,393
- I don't know this girl.
- All right, move along.

910
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:58,692
- Come on, David...
- I want you to arrest me, you asshole!

911
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,819
There's no call for that kind of language.

912
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:04,527
Queen Elizabeth is a man!

913
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:07,226
Prince Charles is a faggot!

914
01:17:07,446 --> 01:17:10,366
- Winston Churchill was full of shit!
- That's enough.

915
01:17:10,617 --> 01:17:12,417
- No! Let go of me!
- David, please!

916
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:15,419
Shakespeare's French!
Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Shit!

917
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,382
- Come on, that's enough.
- David, please!

918
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,301
- Who is this person?
- If you don't stop, I shall arrest you.

919
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:22,582
That's what I want you to do, ya moron!

920
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:24,835
- He's upset. His friend was killed.
- Shut up!

921
01:17:25,047 --> 01:17:28,167
That's enough.
About your business, both of you.

922
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:30,786
You're not gonna arrest me?

923
01:17:31,261 --> 01:17:33,782
- Don't you think he should arrest me?
- I don't know.

924
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:36,015
- Perhaps he thinks it's a prank.
- A prank?

925
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:38,505
- David...
- I've had enough of this foolishness.

926
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:40,048
All right, come on...

927
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:43,070
- It's hopeless. It's hopeless.
- Let's go.

928
01:17:43,315 --> 01:17:46,195
Leave me alone!
You people are crazy!

929
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:49,845
- I gotta get outta here!
- David, don't lose control!

930
01:17:50,116 --> 01:17:51,714
What control?

931
01:17:51,907 --> 01:17:54,387
Jack was real.
He tried to warn me...

932
01:17:54,617 --> 01:17:56,178
- David...
- I love you.

933
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:58,681
What?

934
01:17:58,873 --> 01:17:59,953
I love you.

935
01:18:00,124 --> 01:18:02,565
But I think I did some
terrible things last night...

936
01:18:02,876 --> 01:18:05,197
- Let's go and see Dr Hirsch.
- You gotta stay away from me.

937
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,541
I can help you.

938
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:09,795
No, I'm not safe to be with.
You gotta stay away from me.

939
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,171
I love you, Alex.

940
01:18:15,305 --> 01:18:17,505
(tyres screech/horn honks)

941
01:18:18,017 --> 01:18:19,738
David!

942
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:25,392
The forensic lab seemed to feel some
sort of animal was involved, that's true.

943
01:18:25,693 --> 01:18:26,811
I hardly think...

944
01:18:26,984 --> 01:18:31,266
Regardless of what you think, Inspector,
David is missing, and we must find him.

945
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,614
- Before nightfall.
- Gentlemen, please.

946
01:18:34,867 --> 01:18:37,547
We shall find Mr Kessler
as quickly as we're able.

947
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:41,947
- He tried to get himself arrested.
- Getting arrested isn't that difficult.

948
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,769
He wants help. He really...

949
01:18:43,959 --> 01:18:46,041
- How can we assist you?
- Stay here.

950
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,894
If we need you, we'll know
where to reach you.

951
01:18:50,717 --> 01:18:54,195
I cannot accept a connection between
David Kessler and last night's murders.

952
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,151
We will find him, however.
I can assure you of that.

953
01:18:58,432 --> 01:19:00,394
We'll find him. Not to worry.

954
01:19:01,392 --> 01:19:02,554
I promise.

955
01:19:15,823 --> 01:19:20,185
Yes, operator, I'd like to call the United
States and reverse the charges.

956
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,537
David Kessler, for anyone.

957
01:19:24,209 --> 01:19:26,329
Thank you. I'll wait.

958
01:19:28,213 --> 01:19:31,533
Hello? It's area code 516,...

959
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,078
..472 3402.

960
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:38,307
402.

961
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:40,475
Thank you.

962
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:46,597
Hello, Rachel? Just say yes,
you'll accept the charges.

963
01:19:46,899 --> 01:19:49,338
Say yes, Rachel.

964
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:54,511
Hi. Is Mom or Dad at home?

965
01:19:56,782 --> 01:19:59,023
Well, where are they?

966
01:19:59,243 --> 01:20:01,283
Well, where's Max?

967
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,050
You're all alone?

968
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:08,651
Mom and Dad would never leave me
alone when I was ten.

969
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,318
No, not ten and a half, either.

970
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:16,845
I'm still in London.
Yes, I'm all better now.

971
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:21,218
Listen, Rachel,...

972
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:26,207
..tell Mom and Dad
that I love them, OK?

973
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:30,239
Just do it for me, will ya, please?

974
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:33,166
And, uh,...

975
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:35,962
..don't fight with Max.

976
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:38,397
Well, try.

977
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:42,176
And please don't forget what
I told ya about Mom and Dad.

978
01:20:42,454 --> 01:20:45,014
That I love them.

979
01:20:46,456 --> 01:20:48,976
And I love Max,
and I love you too.

980
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:50,770
I do.

981
01:20:50,961 --> 01:20:53,922
No, I'm not being silly,
ya little creep.

982
01:20:54,174 --> 01:20:56,494
You promise?

983
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,718
OK.

984
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:03,828
- You be a good girl, then.
- (siren approaching)

985
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,539
Yeah, I love you.

986
01:21:07,855 --> 01:21:09,573
Goodbye.

987
01:22:02,826 --> 01:22:05,666
- How much is it?
- 2.80, sir.

(# porn-film music)

989
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:14,044
(heavy breathing)

990
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:37,880
Hi, Jack.

991
01:22:38,945 --> 01:22:40,946
Hi, David.

992
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:55,734
What are you doing 'ere? You promised
never to do this kind of thing again!

993
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:59,164
- I never promised you any such thing.
- Not you, you twit. Her.

994
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:02,359
I've never seen you before in my life.

995
01:23:02,595 --> 01:23:03,554
Oh, sorry.

996
01:23:09,933 --> 01:23:11,814
Good movie.

997
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:13,099
Mm-hmm.

998
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:15,881
What can I say, Jack?

999
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:20,691
Ya don't have to say anything, David.

1000
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:25,666
- Aren't ya gonna say "I told ya so"?
- If I were still alive, I probably would.

1001
01:23:26,326 --> 01:23:29,243
But I did tell you so, you schmuck.

1002
01:23:31,664 --> 01:23:33,744
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

1003
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:38,893
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1004
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:43,654
I don't even know if it was me that killed
those people. I don't remember doing it.

1005
01:23:45,427 --> 01:23:48,147
What about the zoo?

1006
01:23:48,389 --> 01:23:51,111
Well, even if I'm not the Wolf Man,...

1007
01:23:51,351 --> 01:23:54,070
..I'm crazy enough to do
somethin' like that.

1008
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:57,312
Look at me - in a porno theatre
in Piccadilly Circus,...

1009
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,727
..talking to a corpse.

1010
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,042
I'm actually glad to see ya, Jack.

1011
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:08,032
I want ya to meet some people.

1012
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:12,522
David Kessler,
this is Gerald Bringsley.

1013
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:17,181
Gerald's the man
you murdered on the subway.

1014
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:21,699
We thought it best for you not to see
him. He's a fresh kill and pretty messy.

1015
01:24:23,217 --> 01:24:26,256
Yes. I do look most unpleasant.

1016
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,190
Why are you doing this to me?

1017
01:24:28,387 --> 01:24:32,067
This isn't Mr Goodman's idea.
He's your good friend.

1018
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:37,110
Whereas I am a victim of your
carnivorous lunar activities.

1019
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,239
Mr Bringsley,...

1020
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:42,521
..I'm sorry.

1021
01:24:42,736 --> 01:24:45,375
I have absolutely no idea
what to say to you.

1022
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:49,613
You've left my wife a widow
and my children fatherless.

1023
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:54,148
And, I understand, I am to walk the earth
in limbo - one of the living dead -

1024
01:24:54,621 --> 01:24:58,942
..until the wolf's bloodline is
severed and the curse lifted.

1025
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:05,960
You must die, David Kessler.

1026
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:09,097
David?

1027
01:25:09,596 --> 01:25:13,556
This is Harry Berman and his fiance,
Judith Browns.

1028
01:25:14,183 --> 01:25:16,144
- Hello.
- Hello.

1029
01:25:16,352 --> 01:25:20,512
And these gentlemen are Alf,
Ted and Joseph.

1030
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,335
Can't say we're pleased
to meet you, Mr Kessler.

1031
01:25:24,277 --> 01:25:26,516
What shall I do?

1032
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:29,630
- Suicide.
- You must take your own life.

1033
01:25:29,866 --> 01:25:32,227
That's easy for you to say.
You're already dead.

1034
01:25:32,453 --> 01:25:37,171
No, David. Harry and I and everyone
you murder are not dead. Undead.

1035
01:25:37,624 --> 01:25:39,824
Why are you doing this to me?

1036
01:25:40,043 --> 01:25:43,603
Because this must be stopped.

1037
01:25:45,132 --> 01:25:46,211
How shall I do it?

1038
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:49,221
- Sleeping pills?
- Not sure enough.

1039
01:25:49,802 --> 01:25:52,242
- I could hang myself.
- No.

1040
01:25:52,472 --> 01:25:56,552
No, if you did it wrong it could be
painful. You'd choke to death.

1041
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:58,416
So what? Let him choke!

1042
01:25:58,604 --> 01:26:00,484
Do you mind?
The man's a friend of mine!

1043
01:26:00,686 --> 01:26:04,527
- Well, he ain't no friend to me.
- Gentlemen, please.

1044
01:26:04,817 --> 01:26:07,456
- A gun!
- I know where you can get a gun.

1045
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:11,540
- Don't I need a silver bullet?
- Oh, be serious, would you?

1046
01:26:11,827 --> 01:26:13,945
- Madness.
- No, a gun would be good.

1047
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,280
Put the gun to your head
and pull the trigger.

1048
01:26:16,496 --> 01:26:19,217
If you put it in your mouth
you'd be sure not to miss.

1049
01:26:19,624 --> 01:26:22,264
Thank you. You're all so thoughtful.

1050
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,719
A knife!

1051
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,958
- An electric shock!
- A car crash!

1052
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:28,812
- Throw yourself in front of a tube.
- Drowning.

1053
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,159
(David moaning in agony)

1054
01:26:57,036 --> 01:26:59,996
(woman in film moaning with pleasure)

1055
01:27:14,387 --> 01:27:16,067
Go away.

1056
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:18,584
Please, go away.

1057
01:27:23,228 --> 01:27:26,509
Please... run!

1058
01:27:29,737 --> 01:27:31,256
(growling)

1059
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:37,132
- (shriek)
- What was that?

1060
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:39,728
- I don't know!
- I'll check on the house.

1061
01:27:41,664 --> 01:27:43,706
(phone ringing in film)

1062
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:44,878
Hello?

1063
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:47,552
No, I'm sorry.

1064
01:27:47,754 --> 01:27:50,594
No, nobody of that name.
OK. Thank you. Bye.

1065
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:51,681
(growling)

1066
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:58,169
Help! Help!

1067
01:27:58,388 --> 01:27:59,907
- Help!
- What's the matter?

1068
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:02,059
- There's a mad thing in there!
- Where?

1069
01:28:02,268 --> 01:28:04,588
- A mad dog is tearing...
- Calm down!

1070
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,293
Oh, do something!

1071
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:07,321
(screams)

1072
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:10,977
(woman in film panting)

1073
01:28:12,236 --> 01:28:14,876
Oh, right there. Yeah, right there.

1074
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:18,714
Oh, yeah, harder. Oh, yeah.

1075
01:28:25,499 --> 01:28:27,300
Jesus Christ!

1076
01:28:41,558 --> 01:28:43,038
(roars)

1077
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:45,713
(growls)

1078
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:53,939
For Christ's sake, John, there's a monster
in there! Call for assistance!

1079
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:56,515
Better bring rifles!

1080
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,780
(growling)

1081
01:28:58,991 --> 01:29:01,791
Will you people get out of the way!

1082
01:29:09,252 --> 01:29:11,972
(sirens)

1083
01:29:28,355 --> 01:29:29,955
(growling)

1084
01:29:31,484 --> 01:29:34,243
- What the hell's going on here?
- Some kind of animal, sir.

1085
01:29:36,196 --> 01:29:38,876
(growling/screaming)

1086
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:44,592

(snarling)

1090
01:30:25,203 --> 01:30:29,644
Sister Hobbs said there's a disturbance in
Piccadilly Circus - some sort of mad dog.

1091
01:30:29,959 --> 01:30:31,517
David!

1092
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:37,055
(growling/snarling)

1093

(howling)

1095
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:48,747
It's a dead end down there!

1096
01:30:49,019 --> 01:30:51,579
(howling continues)

1097
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,222
Clear this street!

1098
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,454
(siren)

1099
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,118
(tyres screech)

1100

(car horn)

1101
01:31:27,474 --> 01:31:29,273
David. It's David.

1102
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:32,264
Alex! Alex!

1103
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:45,158
(howling)

1104
01:32:02,134 --> 01:32:04,453
- Let me through!
- Stand aside, miss!

1105
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:06,678
You must let me through!

1106
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:10,040
Come back!

1107

Alex!

1108
01:32:24,782 --> 01:32:27,341
David? Is it you?

1109
01:32:38,878 --> 01:32:40,679
David.

1110
01:32:42,715 --> 01:32:44,516
They're going to kill you.

01:32:44,718 --> 01:32:46,558
(growling)

1112
01:32:49,138 --> 01:32:51,097
David...

1113
01:32:52,642 --> 01:32:54,602
Please...

1114
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:57,404
Please let me help you.

1115
01:32:57,605 --> 01:32:59,367
(growls)

1116
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:05,091
I love you, David.
