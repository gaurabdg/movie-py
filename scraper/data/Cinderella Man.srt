'Cause of who you're fighting.

it is you're fighting.

How much?
$250.

671

You're on at the big show
at the Garden, tomorrow night.

And it ain't no favor,
either.

677
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,864
Griffin's opponent got cut,
and he couldn't fight.

678
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,562
So they had to find somebody they
could throw in at a day's notice.

679

Nobody legit would...

Nobody would take a fight
with Griffin without training.

681

Griffin's gonna knock out a guy...

The purse was $250.

941
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,682
My end of that was a little less
than half. It was, like, $123.

942
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,809
We owed $118.

I wouldn't have hit Sara.
I know, Mike.

I couldn't live with myself

with all this shit.

win, you could've told me.

Yeah, I saw.
You did?

reverse their ruling.

965

He thinks he can get me
another fight.

966

He wants me to stop working
and get back in shape.

just the one fight.

You know what that is
right there?

start getting serious around here.

01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:57,398
Hey, why don't you boys go and
get ready for bed, all right?

1548
01:41:57,502 --> 01:41:58,491
[Crying]

1549
01:42:20,758 --> 01:42:22,385
I used to pray...

1550
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:26,095
for you to get hurt
just enough...

1551
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:29,491
so you couldn't fight anymore.

1552
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:33,929
And when they took your license
away, even scared as I was...

1553
01:42:34,205 --> 01:42:37,504
I went to the church
and I thanked God for it.

1554
01:42:38,309 --> 01:42:39,936
'Cause I always knew...

1555
01:42:40,044 --> 01:42:43,502
a day might come
when it could kill you.

1556
01:42:44,082 --> 01:42:46,812
I just knew it, Jimmy.
And now it's here.

1557
01:42:46,885 --> 01:42:48,580
You just got the jitters,
that's all.

1558
01:42:48,653 --> 01:42:51,451
He's killed two men, Jimmy!
What's worth it?

1559
01:42:53,191 --> 01:42:57,059
I have to believe I got some
kind of say over our lives. Okay?

1560
01:42:57,729 --> 01:43:00,254
You know, that if things are
bad, that we can change them...

1561
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:02,299
we can make things better
for our family.

1562
01:43:02,367 --> 01:43:05,803
But I need you to be safe...

1563
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:07,337
Nothing's safe anymore, Mae.
... so much.

1564
01:43:07,405 --> 01:43:08,394
And without that...

1565
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:10,703
I need you to be safe!
... nothing's safe at all.

1566
01:43:10,775 --> 01:43:11,969
All right.

1567
01:43:12,043 --> 01:43:14,910
I have stood by for all of it.

1568
01:43:16,014 --> 01:43:17,345
Until now.

1569
01:43:19,017 --> 01:43:22,111
Not for this, Jimmy.
I just can't.

1570
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:25,251
So you train all you want.

1571
01:43:25,323 --> 01:43:28,258
Make a show of it
for yourself, for the papers.

1572
01:43:28,726 --> 01:43:31,092
But you find a way
out of that fight.

1573
01:43:31,229 --> 01:43:33,754
Break your hand again
if you have to.

1574

[Coughing]

1575
01:43:49,447 --> 01:43:50,436
(man)
Is he all right?

1576
01:43:57,555 --> 01:43:59,113
So, how's he doing?

1577
01:43:59,757 --> 01:44:01,952
He's old. He's arthritic.

1578
01:44:02,227 --> 01:44:04,787
And his ribs haven't been
right since the Lasky fight.

1579
01:44:05,496 --> 01:44:07,487
What's the bad news,

1580

Jesus.

1582

Right. Get rid of that

You're the belle of the ball!

about no goddamn ribs.

Hey, look. It's him.

Look, it's him!
It's Jimmy, look, right there!

We're with you, Jimmy! You're
gonna beat him, Bulldog!

here. Hi, Aunt Alice.

Yeah, sure.
All right. Be back soon.

1598
01:47:27,131 --> 01:47:30,328
Hello, Mae.
I came to pray for Jim.

1599
01:47:32,837 --> 01:47:34,498
So did they.

1600
01:47:35,673 --> 01:47:36,765
Yeah.

1601
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:48,851

that Jim's fighting for them.

Yeah?

1606
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,978
Who beat that
John Henry Lewis?

1607
01:48:59,257 --> 01:49:01,487
That Braddock guy.
Correct.

1608
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:05,020
Who whupped that
Art Lasky punk?

1609
01:49:05,429 --> 01:49:07,693
James J. Braddock.
Correct again.

1610
01:49:08,332 --> 01:49:09,959
Now, refresh me
on this one.

1611
01:49:10,034 --> 01:49:13,299
Who was it took that Corn Griffin
and turned him inside out...

1612
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:16,169
with no questions asked?
Who was that?

1613
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:18,197
I used to think it was me...

1614
01:49:18,276 --> 01:49:19,709
but now I'm kinda thinking
it was you.

1615
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:22,211
No, don't you
sell yourself short.

1616
01:49:23,047 --> 01:49:26,414
At some stage, you think maybe
you're gonna do some taping here?

1617
01:49:27,518 --> 01:49:29,076
Why not?

1618
01:49:34,992 --> 01:49:37,859
All right, let's see.
How's that?

1619

Excuse me, ma'am.

1622
01:50:10,494 --> 01:50:13,019
You can't win
without me behind you.

1623
01:50:16,267 --> 01:50:18,667
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1624
01:50:28,212 --> 01:50:30,237
Maybe I understand some.

1625
01:50:31,382 --> 01:50:33,247
About having to fight.

1626
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:37,549
So you just remember
who you are.

1627
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:41,180
You're the
Bulldog of Bergen...

and the pride of New Jersey.

1629

You're everybody's hope.

you better get home.

You know, boxers hang around
places like this...

1635
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:16,059
and you don't want to get tangled
up with that kind of crowd.
