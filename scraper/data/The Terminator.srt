All this...

498
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:07,626
This whole place.

499
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:09,895
Everything.

500
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:11,229
It's gone.

501
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:14,667
Just gone.

502
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,336
There
were survivors.

503
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:18,454
Here.

504
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:19,855
There.

505
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:24,460
Nobody even knew
who started it.

506
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:29,030
It was
the machines, Sarah.

00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:46,965
They say
it got smart--

514
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:49,567
a new order
of intelligence.

515
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:52,371
<i>Then it saw all
people as a threat,</i>

516
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:55,591
not just the ones
on the other side.

517
00:45:55,658 --> 00:45:58,761
Decided our fate
in a microsecond--

518
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:01,797
extermination.

519
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,612
Did you see this war?

520
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,930
[Tires screech]

521
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:31,958
No.

522
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:33,777
I grew up
after it...

523
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:35,779
In the ruins.

524
00:46:35,846 --> 00:46:37,281
Starving...

525
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:39,183
Hiding from hks.

526
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,100
Hks?

527
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:41,952
Hunter-killers.

528
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,821
Patrol machines built
in automated factories.

529
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:47,725
Most of us
were rounded up,

530
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:52,112
put in camps
for orderly disposal.

531
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,031
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

532
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,255
Some of us
were kept alive...

533
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:03,841
To work...

Loading bodies.

535
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:09,162
The disposal units
ran night and day.

536
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,600
We were that close
to going out forever.

537
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:18,939
There was one man
who taught us to fight,

538
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:21,342
to storm the wire
of the camps,

539
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:25,312
to smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

540
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,047
He turned it around.

541
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:29,483
He brought us
back from the brink.

542
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:31,434
His name is Connor.

543
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:34,154
John Connor.

544
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,522
Your son, Sarah.

No, Reese! No! No!

No! They'll kill you.

Are you sure it's them?

563
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:57,624
Maybe I should look
at the bodies.

564
00:50:57,692 --> 00:50:59,425
No. They've
been identified,

565
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:00,727
and there's
no doubt.

Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.

Hi, Sarah.

572

I want you to tell him
everything

573
00:51:16,928 --> 00:51:18,295
that Reese told you.

574
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:19,696
Do you feel up to that?

575
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:21,932
Yeah. I guess so.

576

So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

583
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:04,984
With the 132nd,
under Perry.

584
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,720
From 21 to 27.

585
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,606
That's the year 2027?

586
00:53:10,673 --> 00:53:12,641
That's right.
And I was assigned...

Who was the enemy again?

00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,832

[beep beep beep]

Oh, damn. Sorry.

Built for sac-NORAD
by cyberdine systems.

00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:27,423
I see.

595
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:31,093
And this, uh, computer
thinks it can win

596
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:34,163
by killing the mother
of its enemy,

597
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:35,681
killing him, in effect,

598
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:37,383
before
he's even conceived,

599
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,752
a sort of
retroactive abortion?

600
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,354
That guy Silberman
cracks me up.

601
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:44,824
Last week, he had this guy
in here that burned his Afghan.

602
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,659
He screwed it first,
then he set it on fire.

603
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:47,760
Hey, shut up.

604
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:49,945
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

605
00:53:50,013 --> 00:53:52,515
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

606
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:54,350
It had no choice.

607
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,136
Their defense grid
was smashed.

608
00:53:57,203 --> 00:53:58,554
We'd won.

609
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:01,457
Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

610
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:04,810
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

611
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,762
Is that when you
captured the lab complex

612
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,564
and found that--
uh, what is it called?

613
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:11,934
The time displacement
equipment?

614
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:16,305
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

615
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:19,275
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

616
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:21,277
How are you
supposed get back?

617
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:23,329
I can't.

618
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,833
Nobody goes home.

619
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:31,437
Nobody else comes through.

620
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:35,374

It's just him...And me.

00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,402
Why didn't you
bring any weapons,

624
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,404
something
more advanced?

625
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:33,108
Don't you have

626
00:56:33,176 --> 00:56:34,242
Ray guns.

627

Show me a piece of

Something about the field
generated by a living organism.

Why?

632
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:46,121
I didn't build
the fucking thing!

Ok, ok.
But this...

00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:53,378
Oh. Right,
right--

637
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:54,712
this is great stuff.

638
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,681
I could make a career
out of this guy.

639
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,383
You see how clever
this part is?

640
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,650
How it doesn't require
a shred of proof?

641
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:01,453
Most paranoid delusions
are intricate,

642
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,488
but this is brilliant.

643
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,924
Why were the other
2 women killed?

644
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:09,544
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

645
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:12,130
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

646
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:16,251
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

647
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,519
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

648
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:20,421
Uh-huh. Well,
let's go back to--

649
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:23,308
look, you have heard enough!
I have answered your questions!

650
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,643
Now I have to see
Sarah Connor!

651
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:27,462
I'm afraid
that's not up to me.

652
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,097
Then why am I
talking to you?

653
00:57:29,165 --> 00:57:30,298
Because
I can help you.

654
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:31,766
Who is in
authority here? Reese--

655

You still don't
get it, do you?

657
00:57:35,905 --> 00:57:37,338
He'll find her.

658
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:38,940
That's what he does!

659
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:42,110
That's all he does!

660
00:57:42,178 --> 00:57:44,045
You can't stop him!

661
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:45,764
He'll wade through you,
reach down her throat,

662
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:47,749
and pull
her fucking heart out!

Where was I?

1028
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:28,000
What's most difficult for me
is trying to decide

1029
01:40:28,068 --> 01:40:30,169
what to tell you
and what not to.

1030
01:40:30,237 --> 01:40:31,855
But I guess
I have a while yet

1031
01:40:31,922 --> 01:40:34,891
before you're old enough
to even understand these tapes.

They're more for me
at this point,

Should I tell you
about your father?

Boy, that's a tough one.

1040
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:30,163
Will it affect your decision
to send him here,

1041
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:33,099
knowing that he is
your father?

I will tell you.

Maybe it'll help if...

What did he just say?

He says you're very
beautiful, señora,

1057
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:22,098
and he's ashamed
to ask you

for 5 American dollars
for his picture,
