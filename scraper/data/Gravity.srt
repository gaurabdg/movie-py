1
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,985
<i>Please verify that the P1 ATA removal...</i>

2
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:09,946
<i>...on replacement cap part 1 and 2
are complete.</i>

3
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,576
DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.

4
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,328
<i>Okay. Copy that, Explorer.</i>

5
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,748
<i>Dr. Stone, Houston.</i>

6
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:22,792
<i>Medical is concerned
about your ECG readings.</i>

7
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,711
I'm fine, Houston.

8
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,798
<i>Well, Medical doesn't agree,
doc. Are you feeling nauseous?</i>

9
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,677
<i>Not any more than usual, Houston.
Diagnostics are green.</i>

10
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,264
<i>Link to communications card
ready for data reception.</i>

11
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:41,060
<i>If this works, when we touch down tomorrow,
I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.</i>

12
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,604
<i>That's a date, doctor.</i>

13
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,483
<i>Just remember,
Houston's partial to margaritas.</i>

14
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,903
<i>Booting comms card now.</i>

15
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,780
<i>Please confirm link.</i>

16
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,533
<i>That's a negative, we're not seeing any data.</i>

17
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,536
<i>Stand by, Houston,
I'm gonna reboot the comms card.</i>

18
00:01:58,787 --> 00:01:59,746
<i>Standing by.</i>

19
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,832
<i>Houston, I have a
bad feeling about this mission.</i>

20
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,584
<i>Please expand.</i>

21
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,628
<i>Okay, let me tell you a story.</i>

22
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,215
<i>It was '96. I'd been up here for 42 days.</i>

23
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,051
<i>Every time I passed over Texas,
I looked down...</i>

24
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,305
<i>...knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up, thinking of me.</i>

25
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,225
<i>Six weeks I'm blowing kisses at that woman.</i>

26
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:23,937
<i>Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she's run off with this lawyer.</i>

27
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,064
<i>So I packed my car, and I headed to--</i>

28
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalski.</i>

29
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:33,112
<i>As Houston recalls,
she, uh, took off in your '74 GTO.</i>

30
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,699
<i>Engineering requests fuel status
on the jetpack prototype.</i>

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,495
<i>Five hours off the reservation
and I show 30 percent drain.</i>

32
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,372
<i>Give my compliments to Engineering.</i>

33
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,208
<i>Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis...</i>

34
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,252
<i>...this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.</i>

35
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,630
<i>Engineering says thank you.</i>

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,216
Tell them I still prefer
my '67 Corvette, though.

37
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,511
<i>- Speaking of which, did I ever tell you--
- We know the Corvette story.</i>

38
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,096
Even Engineering?

39
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,223
<i>Especially Engineering.</i>

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,934
<i>We're going to miss you, Matt.</i>

41
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,562
<i>Comms card reboot in progress.</i>

42
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:06,896
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

43
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,107
<i>Shariff, what's your status?</i>

44
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:13,361
<i>Nearly there.
Replacing battery module A 1 and C.</i>

45
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,781
<i>Could you be a little more specific?</i>

46
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,409
<i>Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.</i>

47
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,328
<i>No, no, no, Houston. Don't be anxious.</i>

48
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,747
<i>Anxiety's not good for the heart.</i>

49
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,250
<i>System is ready to reactivate.</i>

50
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,628
<i>Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional.</i>

51
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:34,215
<i>That applause you hear is for you, Shariff.</i>

52
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,051
<i>Congratulations.
Kick back, take the rest of the day off.</i>

53
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,850
<i>Matt, do you have a visual...</i>

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,270
<i>...on just what Mission Specialist Shariff
is doing up there?</i>

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,523
He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.

56
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,319
But that would be just a best-guess scenario
on my part.

57
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,195
<i>Dr. Stone, Houston.</i>

58
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,115
<i>Medical now have you
with a temperature drop to 35. 9...</i>

59
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,784
<i>...and a heart-rate rise to 70.</i>

60
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:04,329
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

61
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,914
<i>Houston, I'm fine.</i>

62
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,959
<i>It's just keeping your lunch down in zero-G
is harder than it looks.</i>

63
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:14,172
<i>Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.</i>

64
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,842
Negative. We've been here a week,
Houston. Let's just finish this. Ahem.

65
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,510
Card is up.

66
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,596
<i>No, that's a negative.</i>

67
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,891
<i>I'm afraid we're getting nothing
on this end, doctor.</i>

68
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,393
Try again.

69
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:29,562
<i>No, still nothing.</i>

70
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,608
Houston, can you please
turn that music off?

71
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,318
<i>Kowalski.</i>

72
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,028
<i>Not a problem.</i>

73
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,780
Thank you, Kowalski.

74
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,409
Now, Houston?

75
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,578
<i>That's a negative.</i>

76
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,414
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?

77
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>Well, we're not receiving any data.</i>

78
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,755
<i>Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.</i>

79
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,716
Let me see what's going on.

80
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,386
What have we got?

81
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,646
Visual examination doesn't reveal
any damaged components.

82
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,649
The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.

83
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,026
<i>Yeah, that seems to be the case.</i>

84
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,697
<i>Engineering admits that you warned us
that this could happen.</i>

85
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,825
<i>That's as close to an apology
as you're going to get from them.</i>

86
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,868
<i>We should have listened to you, doc.</i>

87
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,413
<i>Well, looks like
we're going to have to improvise.</i>

88
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,831
I'm on it.

89
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,417
<i>How long do you think it'll take you?</i>

90
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,419
One hour. Ahem.

91
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,837
<i>Outstanding.</i>

92
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,298
<i>Installing your system in the Hubble
is the purpose of this mission...</i>

93
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,718
<i>...and so we appreciate
your patience, doctor.</i>

94
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,804
<i>Kowalski, we know you don't care
about things like this...</i>

95
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:48,474
<i>...but, uh, for your information,
this delay is not going to be long enough...</i>

96
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,436
<i>...for you to break Anatoly Solovyev's
spacewalking record.</i>

97
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,772
<i>- It seems like you're gonna be left--
- Seventy-five minutes shy?</i>

98
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,816
<i>Never crossed my mind.</i>

99
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,526
Matt...

100
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,862
<i>...it's been a privilege.</i>

101
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,031
<i>Right back at you, Houston.</i>

102
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,366
<i>Enjoy your last walk.</i>

103
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:09,120
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone
in removing the panel?

104
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,748
<i>- Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.</i>

105
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,042
Thank you, Houston. Agh.

106
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,543
Mind if I join the fun?

107
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,544
Certainly.

108
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,296
How you feeling?

109
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,341
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble-dried.

110
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,928
Well, it's been a rough week.
If it makes you feel any better...

111
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:30,183
...I coughed up everything
but my kidneys on my first ride.

112
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,101
Shit.

113
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,270
Ah. Ah. Unh.

114
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,317
- Ha, ha.
- Sorry.

115
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,197
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital
where things fall to the floor.

116
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,907
Thank you.

117
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,201
Well, you're the genius up here.

118
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,911
I only drive the bus.

119
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,788
Yeah, well, call me a genius...

120
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,624
...if I can get this board initialized
in the next hour.

121
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,501
<i>Explorer, this is Houston.</i>

122
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,211
Go ahead, Houston.

123
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:02,090
<i>NORAD reports a Russian
satellite has incurred a missile strike.</i>

124
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,051
<i>The impact has created a cloud of debris...</i>

125
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,512
<i>...orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour.</i>

126
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,057
<i>Current debris orbit does not overlap
with your trajectory.</i>

127
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,351
<i>We'll keep you posted on any developments.</i>

128
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,561
<i>Copy that, Houston.</i>

129
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,480
Should we be worried?

130
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,817
No, let's let the boys down there
worry for us.

131
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,862
Explorer, engage arm and pivot
to cargo bay.

132
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,572
<i>Stand by for arm maneuver.</i>

133
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,824
Aah.

134
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,244
So, doc, now that you work for NASA,
how do you like us?

135
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,704
<i>Kind of like winning the lottery, huh?</i>

136
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,958
I was just happy that they didn't cut
the funding to my research.

137
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,252
- How long was your training?
- Oh, six months.

138
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,170
<i>- Including holidays?
- Uh-huh.</i>

139
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,215
So, what is this scanning system?

140
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,466
<i>Oh, nothing, Matt.</i>

141
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,261
<i>It's just a new set of eyes
to scan the edge of the universe.</i>

142
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:52,056
It's designed for hospital use,
but this one's a prototype.

143
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,516
<i>Stand by for locking.</i>

144
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,019
- Unh.
- Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.

145
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,814
Even for your pretty blue eyes.

146
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,192
Well, my eyes are brown.

147
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,155
Right now, your eyes are bloodshot.

148
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:11,242
<i>Kowalski! Is this great or what?</i>

149
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,541
And to think he went to Harvard.

150
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,879
You gotta admit one thing:

151
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,756
Can't beat the view.

152
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,054
So, what do you like about being up here?

153
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,641
The silence.

154
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,187
I could get used to it.

155
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,000
Terrific.

156
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,462
Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

157
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,173
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

158
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,800
<i>You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.</i>

159
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,595
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.

160
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,263
<i>Please elaborate.</i>

161
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,142
It's the same feeling I had
about Mardi Gras in 1987.

162
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,228
<i>That is affirmative.</i>

163
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,606
<i>Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story.</i>

164
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,233
<i>Please proceed.</i>

165
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,486
Well, it's day one, and I'm bumping
my way down Bourbon Street...

166
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,113
...looking for a sister of a friend of mine.

167
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:35,117
Streets are full of people, I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

168
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,535
Proceeding to override.

169
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:40,539
Then all of a sudden, I look up
and there she is. I'm about to yell out.

170
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,751
I see she's holding hands
with some hairy guy in board shorts...

171
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,544
...and a Margaritaville shirt.

172
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,756
And then I realize that this guy is not a guy.

173
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,841
That my girl is holding hands with--

174
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,927
<i>ISS, this is Houston.</i>

175
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,554
<i>- Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.</i>

176
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,641
<i>Mission abort. Repeat, mission abort.</i>

177
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,186
<i>Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble.
Begin reentry procedure.</i>

178
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,522
<i>ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.</i>

179
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,315
<i>Copy all, Houston, and in work.</i>

180
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>Matt, immediate return to Explorer.
Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.</i>

181
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,363
Copy. Explorer, prep airlock.

182
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,283
<i>Airlock engaged, ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.</i>

183
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,369
<i>Debris from the missile strike
has caused a chain reaction...</i>

184
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,997
<i>...hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.</i>

185
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:25,251
<i>Traveling faster than a high-speed bullet
up towards your altitude. All copy.</i>

186
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,502
Copy all.

187
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,170
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.

188
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:31,841
I can't. The board is still initializing.

189
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,510
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- One second.

190
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,888
Not one second. Now. Shut it down.

191
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,765
That's an order.

192
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,518
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm done.
I'm done.

193
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,354
<i>Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.</i>

194
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,982
<i>- All right, Sharif f, let's do this.
- Roger, Matt.</i>

195
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,233
Houston, update.

196
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,319
<i>Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.</i>

197
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,447
<i>It's been confirmed
that it's the unintentional side effect...</i>

198
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,866
<i>...of the Russians striking
one of their own satellites.</i>

199
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,618
<i>They shot down their own satellite?
- Right of disposal.</i>

200
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,788
Most likely a spy sat gone bad.
Now it's shrapnel.

201
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,623
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

202
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:08,586
<i>Locks releasing in three, two, one.</i>

203
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,380
<i>Explorer, new data coming through.</i>

204
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,132
What's the blowback, Houston?

205
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,135
<i>It's not good. Most of our systems are gone.</i>

206
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,764
<i>Debris chain reaction is out of control
and rapidly expanding.</i>

207
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>Multiple satellites are down
and they keep on falling.</i>

208
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,352
Define "multiple satellites."

209
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,895
<i>Most of them are gone.</i>

210
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,980
<i>Telecommunication systems are dead.</i>

211
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,316
<i>Expect a communication blackout
at any moment.</i>

212
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,610
<i>Kowalski, visual of debris at 9 o'clock.</i>

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,112
Half of North America
just lost their Facebook.

214
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,739
Explorer, repeat...

215
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,658
<i>...expect a communication blackout
at any moment.</i>

216
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,452
<i>Copy that, Houston.</i>

217
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,039
Explorer, this is Kowalski,
confirming visual contact with debris.

218
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,457
Debris is from a BSE sat.

219
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,542
- Heads up!
- To repeat, I have--

220
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,713
<i>Dr. Stone requesting faster transport.
- We have to go. We have to go, go, go!</i>

221
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,966
<i>Kennedy reports
meteorological conditions no-go...</i>

222
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,843
Houston, Explorer. Copy.

223
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:01,389
<i>Explorer, Dr. Stone requesting
faster transport to bay area.</i>

224
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,640
<i>Explorer, do you copy?</i>

225
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,310
- Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
- You're a go, Kowalski.

226
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,105
<i>Houston, this is Explorer, copy.</i>

227
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,190
<i>- All right.
- We've lost Houston.</i>

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,067
<i>- Unh!
- We've lost Houston.</i>

229
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,820
Unstrap. Look, we need to
get the hell out of here.

230
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,447
<i>Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us.</i>

231
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,865
- Unh!
-It's stuck!

232
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,618
Man down! Man down!

233
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,663
<i>Houston, this is Explorer, copy.
Aah!</i>

234
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,123
<i>Kowalski, repor--</i>

235
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,043
<i>Explorer's been hit. Explorer, do you read?</i>

236
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,169
Aah!

237
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,547
Explorer, over. Explorer.

238
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,302
<i>Astronaut is off structure.
Dr. Stone is off structure.</i>

239
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,264
<i>- Dr. Stone, detach! You must detach!
- No!</i>

240
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,142
<i>If you don't detach,
that arm's gonna carry you too far!</i>

241
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,686
<i>- Listen to my voice! You need to focus!
- I can't!</i>

242
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,273
<i>I'm losing visual of you.
In a few seconds I won't be able to track you.</i>

243
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,482
<i>You need to detach!</i>

244
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,319
<i>- I can't see you anymore. Do it now!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!</i>

245
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,407
<i>Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.</i>

<i>Dr. Stone, do you copy?</i>

248
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,381
<i>Repeat, do you copy?</i>

249
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,718
<i>- Yes, yes, yes, I copy! I'm detached!

<i>Report your position.</i>

GPS is down. I can't-- It's down, I can't--

253
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,437
<i>- Give me a visual.

254
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,564
<i>- Do you have a visual of Explorer?
- No.</i>

255

<i>- Do you have a visual of ISS?

256

<i>You need to focus. Anything, use

Kowals-- I have a vis--
Kowalski, I have a visual.

I have a visual of Explorer.

00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,644
With north at 12 o'clock...

263

...and the shuttle is at the center of the dial.

264
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,194
I can see the Chinese station.

265
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,698
No, it's the International Space Station.

266
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,908

Houston, do you copy?

271

Houston, this is

<i>- Repeat, do you copy?

<i>Flash your light.</i>

<i>- My light?

283
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,221
Okay.

284
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,143
Okay, okay. Here, here! I'm here!

<i>There you are. Hang on tight.</i>

<i>Your status. Give me your readings.</i>

289
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,862
Three... Three...

290
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,156
Three-point-six PSI.

291
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,534
<i>Your O2, give me your O2.</i>

292
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,788
Oxygen is going down. It's going
down fast. It's going down fast. Nine--

293
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,707
No, 8 percent.

Okay, sorry. Yes, copy.

298
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,092

299
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,220
<i>You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.</i>

300
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,848
Sorry. Sorry.

301
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,145
- Aah!
- Gotcha.

302
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,523
All right, now I'm gonna tether you to me.

303
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,820
I know, you never realized
how devastatingly good-looking I am.

304
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,782
But I need you to stop staring
and help me with the tether.

305
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:54,992
Okay?

306
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,994
Okay. Okay.

307
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,246
Uh, I got it.

308
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,915
All right, here we go.

309
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,335
Now, to clear you from the jets,
I'm gonna give you a little push.

310
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,254
- No, no, no.
- Not a push.

311
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,630
A nudge.

312
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,216
No, no, no! Damn it, no!

313
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,727
See? Where you go, I go.

314
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,567
Better.

315
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,153
Let's get out of here.

316
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,116
- Goddamn it! Agh.
- I know what you mean.

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,868
Damn it.

318
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,953
You're burning oxygen.

319
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,874
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

320
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,083
Fuck!

321
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,877
Right. Copy that.

322
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,129
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

323
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,757
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

324
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,385
Can you get the Explorer to prepare
the airlock for arrival? Copy?

325
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,306
Houston, this is Kowalski.
How do you copy?

326
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,100
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

327
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,435
They can't hear us.

328
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,938
We don't know that.
That's why we keep talking.

329
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,316
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

330
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,610
Set your watch for 90 minutes.

331
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,571
- Why 90?
- Houston clocked that debris...

332
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,782
...at 50,000 miles an hour.

333
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,742
If you factor in our current orbit...

334
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,621
...then I figure we got about 90 minutes
before we get our asses kicked again.

335
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,706
O2 down to 6 percent.

336
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,169
Okay. Pretty scary shit
being untethered up here, isn't it?

337
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,756
Yeah, pretty scary shit.

338
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,008
Well, you did all right.

339
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,430
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

340
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,436
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

341
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,064
Our current location is approximately...

342
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,025
<i>...900 meters out from the Explorer.</i>

343
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,028
Dr. Stone and I would like to
retrieve the body...

344
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,030
...of Mission Specialist Sharif f...

345
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,157
...and return it to the shuttle.

346
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,368
Am I a go to retrieve?

347
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,205
Roger that.

348
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,416
Where is he? Where is he?

349
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,608
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,862
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

351
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,492
Grab him!

352
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,997
Grab him! Agh!

353
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
I'm trying, I'm trying!

354
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,504
You're pulling me away.

355
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,756
I got him!

356
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,300
- Clutch him like he's your valentine.
- I got him.

357
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,553
I can't engage my thrust
with you two yo-yoing around.

358
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,377
Jesus Christ.

359
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,880
<i>Here's hoping you have a hell
of an insurance policy, Houston.</i>

360
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,383
The damages to Explorer...

361
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,635
<i>...are catastrophic.</i>

362
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,637
<i>Will commence search for survivors.</i>

363
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,931
<i>O2 down to 5 percent.</i>

364
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,850
All right, here we go. Careful of the edges!

365
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,361
Here. Here!

366
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,040
Houston, in the blind. To confirm:

367
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,044
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

368
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:01,006
...are the sole survivors of the STS-157.

369
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,551
I apologize for not complying.

370
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,596
I should've stopped working
as soon as you instructed me to.

371
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,306
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

372
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,725
There was nothing you could do
to change that.

373
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,855
Hey-

374
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,356
Yes?

375
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:19,775
All right...

376
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,819
...we have to make our way
to the space station.

377
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,322
Over there.

378
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,949
It's a bit of a hike...

379
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,204
...but we need to use their escape pod,
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

380
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,705
Agreed?

381
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,708
Dr. Stone...

382
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,710
...agreed?

383
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,171
Agreed.

384
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,924
All right. After you.

385
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,219
Oh, God.

386
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,564
<i>Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.</i>

387
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,235
<i>Dr. Stone and I have determined
to proceed to ISS...</i>

388
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,571
<i>...and use one of their Soyuz for reentry.</i>

389
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,366
<i>ISS, if you hear us...</i>

390
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,369
<i>...we could sure use a rescue mission.</i>

391
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,468
<i>O2 down to 2 percent.</i>

392
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,053
<i>We're getting there.</i>

393
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,348
<i>Beautiful, don't you think?</i>

394
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,059
<i>What?</i>

395
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,853
The sunrise.

396
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,439
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

397
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,239
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

398
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,369
Ryan, where's home?

399
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,747
- Home?
- Mm-hm.

400
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,084
Down there. Mother Earth.

401
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,295
Where do you pitch your tent?

402
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,842
Lake Zurich.

403
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,677
Where the hell is that?

404
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,890
Illinois.

405
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,143
Illinois. Central time zone.

406
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,229
That would make it roughly...

407
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,273
...8 p.m.

408
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,902
What are the good people of Lake Zurich
doing at 8:00?

409
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,696
I don't know.

410
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,616
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm slowing you down.

411
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,409
What would you be doing?

412
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,747
Come on, Ryan.

413
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,999
It's 8200.

414
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:44,669
You've just left the hospital
after an 18-hour shift.

415
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,546
Driving home.

416
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,635
The radio.

417
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,472
I listen to the radio.

418
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,266
There we go. Let me guess.

419
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,809
NPR?

420
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,394
Classical?

421
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,188
Ton 40?

422
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:10,153
Anything. I don't care,
as long as they don't talk. I just drive.

423
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,574
And where are you driving to?

424
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,495
I just drive.

425
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,331
What do you miss down there?

426
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,793
Is there a Mr. Stone?

427
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,212
No.

428
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,297
Nobody special?

429
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,636
Somebody down there looking up...

430
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,554
...thinking about you?

431
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:39,975
Ryan?

432
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,692
I had a daughter.

433
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,121
She was 4.

434
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,125
She was at school playing tag.

435
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,420
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

436
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,632
Stupidest thing.

437
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,558
I was driving when I got the call, so...

438
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,270
Ever since then, that's what I do.

439
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,731
I wake up...

440
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,525
...I go to work...

441
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,610
...and I just drive.

442
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,973
O2 down to 1 percent.

443
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,237
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

444
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,990
The good news is, we're about 5 minutes
from the ISS...

445
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,576
...and I know where the Russians
stash their vodka.

446
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:25,038
And that is good,
because I'm running on fumes here.

447
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,164
The bad news is...

448
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,376
...I'm gonna be about 10 minutes short
of breaking Anatoly's record, and--

449
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,504
- Agh!
- What?

450
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,256
I'm redlining. My O2 tank pressure is low.

451
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,385
Your tank is out of oxygen,
but you still have it in your suit.

452
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,302
Got it.

453
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,054
So you have to sip, not gulp.

454
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,973
Wine, not beer.

455
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,767
Sip, Ryan.

456
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,396
Houston, in the blind,
we have a visual of the ISS.

457
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,565
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz...

458
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,735
...is missing. The second Soyuz
exhibits surface damage...

459
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,779
...and its chute has been deployed.

460
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,616
Any use as an escape pod for reentry
is impossible.

461
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,202
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

462
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,996
Not yet.
I wasn't kidding about those fumes.

463
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,666
This can has one or two good thrusts left...

464
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,251
...if we're lucky.

465
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,140
Steady.

466
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,109
Aim.

467
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,236
Fire.

468
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,078
- Brake! Brake. You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's...

469
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,123
...empty. We're gonna hit hard.
Grab ahold of anything you can!

470
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,511
What do I do?

471
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,097
What do I do?

472
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:15,899
Ryan!

473
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:24,782
The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!

474
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,284
Grab ahold!

475
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,621
Grab anything!

476
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,305
Ryan!

477
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,559
- Give me five.
- I've got you.

478
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,895
I've got you. Right here.

479
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,441
Shit!

480
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,027
No,no,no!

481
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,488
Got you.

482
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,082
Got you.

483
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,879
You just hold on,
and I'm gonna start pulling you in.

484
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:20,797
Hey, doc.

485
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,632
Just hold on. Hang on.

486
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,093
- I am gonna pull you in.
- Ryan, listen.

487
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,427
You have to let me go.

488
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,012
- No.
- The ropes are too loose.

489
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,264
I'm pulling you with me.

490
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,267
- Let me go or we both die.
- I'm not letting you go!

491
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:33,810
We're fine! Unh.

492
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,144
- Agh!
- No.

493
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,651
Ryan, let go.

494
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,653
No. No.

495
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,072
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

496
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,866
-It's not up to you.
- No, no, no.

497
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,119
Please don't do this.

498
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,454
Please, please, please. Please don't do this.

499
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,457
Please don't do this. No, no, no.
Please don't, Matt.

500
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,334
Please don't do this.

501
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,714
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

502
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,300
No!

503
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,991
I had you. I had you. I had you.

504
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,342
<i>Ryan, do you hear me?</i>

505
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,554
<i>Do you copy?</i>

506
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,391
My CO2 alarm went off.
My CO2 alarm went off.

507
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,685
<i>Look, you need to board the station.</i>

508
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,854
<i>Do you see the airlock?</i>

509
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,615
<i>Hey, Ryan.</i>

510
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,909
<i>You COPY?</i>

511
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,245
<i>Look for the airlock.</i>

512
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,834
<i>It's above you, next to the Zarya module.</i>

513
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,631
<i>You see it?</i>

514
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:30,176
Yes. Yes, I see it. I see it.

515
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,221
<i>All right, good. That's where you wanna go.</i>

516
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,807
<i>Now you're getting light-headed, right?</i>

517
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,684
Yeah. Yes.

518
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,269
<i>That's because you're breathing CO2.</i>

519
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,271
<i>You're losing consciousness.</i>

520
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,065
<i>You need to board the station.</i>

521
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,400
Okay.

522
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,903
<i>That second Soyuz
is too damaged for reentry...</i>

523
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,948
<i>...but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.</i>

524
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,574
Sunday drive?

525
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,576
<i>Look to the west.</i>

526
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,122
<i>You see that dot in the distance?</i>

527
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,790
<i>That's a Chinese station.</i>

528
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,791
Yes.

529
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:05,086
<i>You're gonna take the Soyuz,
and you're gonna cruise over there.</i>

530
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,881
<i>Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.</i>

531
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,842
I've never flown a Shenzhou.

532
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,135
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

533
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:15,680
<i>Its reentry protocol is identical to the Soyuz.</i>

534
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,932
Okay.

535
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,103
<i>You never flown the Soyuz either?</i>

536
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,063
Only a simulator.

537
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,190
<i>Well, then you know.</i>

538
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,069
But I crashed it.

539
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,197
<i>It's a simulator, that's what it's designed for.</i>

540
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,243
Every time.

541
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,412
I crashed it every time.

542
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,915
<i>You point the damn thing
at Earth. It's not rocket science.</i>

543
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,795
<i>And by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be
back in Lake Zurich with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

544
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,131
<i>You COPY?</i>

545
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,301
<i>Ryan, you copy?</i>

546
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:56,262
- I'm gonna take the Soyuz and come get you.
- No, you're not.

547
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,182
<i>- I'm coming to get you.
- I've got too much of a head start.</i>

548
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,852
<i>- I'm coming to get you.
- I'm afraid that ship already sailed.</i>

549
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>Ryan, you're gonna have to learn to let go.</i>

550
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,566
<i>- But I--
- I wanna hear you say...</i>

551
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:09,817
<i>...you're gonna make it.</i>

552
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,529
<i>Come on, Ryan, say it.</i>

553
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,824
I'm gonna make it.

554
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,951
<i>All right. Keep going.</i>

555
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,206
<i>What kind of a name is Ryan for a girl?</i>

556
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,375
Dad wanted a boy.

557
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,920
<i>Are you close to the airlock?</i>

558
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:30,922
Not yet.

559
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,507
<i>Keep going.</i>

560
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,718
<i>So now that we have some distance
between us...</i>

561
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,678
<i>...you're attracted to me, right?</i>

562
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:38,638
What?

563
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,433
<i>Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.</i>

564
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,147
You have beautiful--

565
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,525
You have beautiful blue eyes.

566
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,235
<i>I have brown eyes.</i>

567
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,532
<i>Hey, you wanna know the good news?</i>

568
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:58,491
What?

569
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,493
<i>I'm gonna break Anatoly's record...</i>

570
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,912
<i>...and I think mine's
gonna stand for a long, long time.</i>

571
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,957
Oh, no. I'm coming to get you.

572
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,294
Oh, my God.

573
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,129
What? What?

574
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,798
<i>Wow.</i>

575
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,425
<i>Hey, Ryan?</i>

576
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,927
Yeah?

577
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,096
<i>You should see the sun on the Ganges.</i>

578
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,517
<i>It's amazing.</i>

579
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,452
Where are you? Where are you?
Comms. Comms.

580
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,412
There you are. Okay.

581
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:08,175
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

582
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,722
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

583
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:20,646
Matt, I made it, I'm here,
I'm on the station. Do you copy?

584
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,571
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

585
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,490
Tell me where you are,
give me your position.

586
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:36,078
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

587
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,752
Oh, come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral.

588
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,921
Now you decide to shut up? Talk to me.

589
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,133
Just say something, say anything.
I don't care.

590
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:56,682
Hey-

591
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,853
Tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy.

592
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,938
Huh? Tell me what happened.

593
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,566
What happened to the, uh, hairy guy?

594
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,365
Please talk to me.

595
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,246
Please.

596
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,722
Houston, in the blind...

597
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,103
...this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the ISS.

598
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,858
All communications with
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

599
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,568
...have been lost.

600
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,949
Radio transmission absent.

601
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,911
Visuals nonexistent.

602
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,998
To confirm...

603
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,752
...l, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor...

604
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,546
...of STS-157.

605
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,186
What now?

606
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:53,841
Agh.

607
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,950
Okay.

608
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,039
Okay. Where is it, where is it?

609
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,333
Where is the power? Here you are.

610
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,962
Okay, great, just like training.

611
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,840
Undocking, undocking.

612
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:18,425
Undocking.

613
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,636
Red.

614
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,101
Okay.

615
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:30,979
Okay, where is it?

616
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,939
Where is it?

617
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,274
Come on.

618
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:36,360
Okay.

619
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,366
Okay. Okay, I remember this.
I remember this.

620
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,341
Oh, you don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.

621
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,177
Come on.

622
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:03,762
Okay.

623
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:07,433
Okay. Activate- Activate undock.

624
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,546
Seven minutes to get out of here.

625
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,472
All right, okay.

626
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,113
What? What, what?

627
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:14,833
No, no, no!

628
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,396
Unh! Agh.

629
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,281
Stop, stop, Stop!

630
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:05,342
That's right, that's right.
Come on, come on.

631
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,470
That's right, that's right, that's right.

632
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,013
Ahh.

633
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:11,473
Come on.

634
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:48,885
Great.

635
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,935
Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris.

636
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:55,721
Okay, we detach this and we go home.
Piece of cake.

637
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,706
Okay.

638
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,712
Okay, what do we have?

639
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,881
Okay, all right.

640
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,684
Shit.

641
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,235
Okay, come on.

642
00:51:52,486 --> 00:51:53,820
Come on, come on.

643
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,155
All right.

644
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:27,873
I hate space.

645
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,102
Shut up.

646
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:54,941
Okay.

647
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:04,367
All right.

648
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,081
That's good.

649
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:12,834
Okay.

650
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:16,338
Let's stabilize you.

651
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:32,729
Okay.

652
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:36,816
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

653
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,235
Houston, in the blind...

654
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:43,114
Tiangong is approximately
100 kilometers...

655
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,283
...to the west...

656
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,828
...and I am off its course by about...

657
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:50,622
...13 degrees.

658
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:53,166
I will correct trajectory.

659
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,189
Okay.

660
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,274
Okay.

661
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,151
Okay.

662
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:23,154
I will engage S-Ka-Dae...

663
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:26,282
...in five, four, three...

664
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:27,784
...two, one.

665
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,260
What's happening, what's happening?
Come on, come on.

666
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:48,680
One.

667
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,571
Come on, come OH, come on.

668
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,536
You gotta be kidding me.

669
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,747
You gotta be kidding me!

670
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,836
No! Don't you fu--

671
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:31,973
<i>Houston, in the blind.</i>

672
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,060
<i>Houston, in the blind,
this is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

673
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,314
<i>I'm calling from the Soyuz TMA-14M.</i>

674
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:43,068
<i>I'm currently out of fuel and adrift,
do you copy?</i>

675
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:49,407
<i>Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

676
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,493
<i>Do you copy?</i>

677
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:59,042
<i>Houston. This is Ryan Stone.</i>

678
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:00,502
<i>Do you copy?</i>

679
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,716
Houston, this is Mission--
Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.

680
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:07,967
Do you copy?

681
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:13,306
Houston. Houston, please confirm identity.

682
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,226
Houston, you're coming in
over an AM frequency. Copy.

683
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:19,896
Do you copy?

684
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,566
Is this the Chinese station?
Is this Tiangong? Copy.

685
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,070
Mayday, can you copy?

686
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,656
Mayday, mayday. Mayday.

687
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:33,201
- Mayday.
- Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.

688
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,995
- Mayday.
- Mayday, mayday.

689
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:39,082
<i>Aningaaq.</i>

690
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,295
- Aningaaq, is that your name?
- Aningaaq.

691
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:47,882
- Aningaaq is your name? Is that your name?
- Mayday. Aningaaq.

692
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,385
<i>Aningaaq. mayday-</i>

693
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,637
No, no, no. No, my name is not mayday.

694
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,140
I'm Stone. Dr. Ryan Stone.

695
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,891
I need help. I am--

696
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,522
Those are dogs.

697
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,108
They're calling from Earth.

698
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,489
- They're calling from Earth.
- Ha-ha-ha!

699
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:24,794
Aningaaq...

700
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:28,506
...make your dogs bark again for me,
would you, please?

701
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:33,094
Your dogs. Dogs, you know.

702
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,597
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Woof, woof. Dogs.

703
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,945
Woof, woof.

704
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:21,809
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

705
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:27,357
I know, we're all gonna die.
Everybody knows that.

706
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:30,360
But I'm gonna die today.

707
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,072
Funny, that.

708
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:36,282
You know, to know...

709
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,372
But the thing is, it's that I'm still scared.

710
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,791
I'm really scared.

711
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,089
Nobody will mourn for me,
no one will pray for my soul.

712
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:56,010
Will you mourn for me?

713
00:59:57,512 --> 00:59:59,514
Will you say a prayer for me?

714
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:01,849
Or is it too late?

715
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:10,024
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life, so...

716
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,444
Nobody ever taught me how.

717
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,784
Nobody ever taught me how.

718
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,547
A baby.

719
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,812
There's a baby with you, huh?

720
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:52,358
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

721
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:56,821
That's so sweet.

722
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,659
I used to sing to my baby.

723
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:07,498
I hope I see her soon.

724
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:21,155
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.

725
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:25,326
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

726
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:30,748
Keep singing. And sing and sing.

727
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,572
No, no, no, don't!

728
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:48,242
Check your watch.
Thirteen hours and 11 minutes.

729
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:51,120
Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.

730
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,706
-It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
- How did you--?

731
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,751
- Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did you--?

732
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,546
That's better.

733
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:04,926
I found a little extra--
A little extra battery power.

734
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,678
It helps that I didn't have you around
to distract me.

735
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:10,181
I have to say, I'm glad to see you.

736
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,266
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

737
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:13,935
Did you find the vodka?

738
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,648
- You never told me where it was, so...
- Oh, well...

739
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,441
Ah, ah!

740
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:25,780
To Anatoly.

741
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:35,289
Huh? No? All right.

742
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:37,792
Let's get out of here.

743
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,504
The Chinese station's about 100 miles.

744
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:44,215
Just a little Sunday drive.

745
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,925
- We can't.
- Sure we can.

746
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:49,887
- There's no fuel, I tried everything.
- Well, there's always something we can do.

747
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,264
I tried everything.

748
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,140
Did you try the soft landing jets?

749
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:54,642
They're for landing, so...

750
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:57,728
Landing is launching. It's the same.
Didn't you learn that in training?

751
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:01,274
- I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
- But you know about it.

752
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:04,986
- And I crashed it every time.
- Do you wanna go back or stay here?

753
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,324
I get it, it's nice up here.

754
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:17,331
You can just shut down all the systems...

755
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,126
...turn out all the lights...

756
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:24,046
...and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

757
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,424
There's nobody up here that can hurt you.

758
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,509
It's safe.

759
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,849
I mean, what's the point of going on?
What's the point of living?

760
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:43,107
Your kid died.
Doesn't get any rougher than that.

761
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,154
But still, it's a matter of what you do now.

762
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:53,200
If you decide to go,
then you gotta just get on with it.

763
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,287
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

764
01:05:56,871 --> 01:06:00,291
You gotta plant both your feet
on the ground and start living life.

765
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,001
How did you get here?

766
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,462
I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

767
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:06,213
Hey, Ryan?

768
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:07,590
What?

769
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,675
It's time to go home.

770
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,679
Landing...

771
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,101
Landing... Landing is launching.

772
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:02,937
I said...

773
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:18,327
Okay, landing, landing.

774
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,371
Landing is green.

775
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,289
Agh.

776
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,133
Okay.

777
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,721
Okay, landing. All right.

778
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:40,349
Okay. Soft landing jets
trigger automatically...

779
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,810
...at 3 meters before landing, so...

780
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh, you're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

781
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,819
I need to... I need to get rid of the Bay-O...

782
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,363
...and the engine module.

783
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:56,615
Right. Okay.

784
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,284
Okay.

785
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,996
Okay.

786
01:08:04,874 --> 01:08:06,500
Tri-module separation.

787
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:08,252
Go.

788
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,769
Okay.

789
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:27,897
Houston, here's the tricky part.

790
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:30,232
Soyuz has to think...

791
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:33,819
...we are 3 meters off the Earth.

792
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,698
All right. Okay.

793
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,200
Hey, Matt?

794
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,744
Since I had to listen to endless hours...

795
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,955
...of your storytelling this week,
I need you to do me a favor.

796
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,919
You are gonna see
a little girl with brown hair...

797
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,838
...very messy, lots of knots.

798
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,882
She doesn't like to brush it.

799
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,759
That's okay.

800
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,094
Her name is Sarah.

801
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,223
Can you please tell her...

802
01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:04,975
...that Mama found her red shoe?

803
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:08,270
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.

804
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,397
But it was just right under the bed.

805
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:15,528
Give her...

806
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:19,281
...a big hug and a big kiss for me
and tell her that Mama misses her.

807
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:22,409
You tell her that she is my angel.

808
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,121
And she makes me so proud. So, so proud.

809
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:33,671
And you tell her that I'm not quitting.

810
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,972
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

811
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:46,392
You tell her that I love her so much.

812
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,479
Can you do that for me?

813
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,733
Roger that.

814
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:58,320
Here we go.

815
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,526
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

816
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:43,616
You keep dropping
and you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.

817
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,077
But not without me
because you're my last ride.

818
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,249
Wait.

819
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:00,841
Five.

820
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,260
<i>Four.</i>

821
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,679
Three...

822
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,432
No more just driving.

823
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,477
Let's go home.

824
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,360
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

825
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,779
Steady, steady.

826
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,782
Come on. Come on. Agh!

827
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,747
Where are you? Where are you?
Forty-five, 90, 180.

828
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,123
One-eighty.

829
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:34,667
Agh!

830
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:41,799
Come on.

831
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:52,685
Okay.

832
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,954
Damn it. Agh!

833
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:52,995
Agh!

834
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,085
Shit!

835
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,387
<i>Shenzhou, come on.</i>

836
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,306
<i>Shenzhou.Shenzhou.</i>

837
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:55,808
Fuck!

838
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,059
Okay, this way.

839
01:14:57,703 --> 01:14:59,913
In the Soyuz, the power button is...

840
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,415
...here.

841
01:15:04,168 --> 01:15:07,087
Okay, uh, undocking, undocking. Um--

842
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,131
Uh, eenie, meenie--

843
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,092
Okay, that doesn't sound good.

844
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,594
Minie...

845
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:14,761
...mo.

846
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:21,059
Minie...

847
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,436
...mo.

848
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:25,314
Okay. Okay, good.

849
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,491
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

850
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:40,412
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the Shenzhou.

851
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,332
I'm about to undock from Tiangong.

852
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:45,626
Uh...

853
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:50,714
And I have a bad feeling
about this mission. Ha, ha.

854
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,093
Reminds me of a story, Houston. Aah!

855
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:01,183
Never-- Never mind the story, Houston.
Never mind the story.

856
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:06,688
It's getting hot in here. Okay. All right.

857
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,690
Okay.

858
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,443
All right, the way I see it...

859
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,695
...there's only two possible outcomes.

860
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,989
Either I make it down there in one piece...

861
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,659
...and I have one hell of a story to tell...

862
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,953
...or I burn up in the next 10 minutes.

863
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:22,704
Aah.

864
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,249
Either way, whichever way...

865
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,377
...no harm, no foul! Aah!

866
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,635
Because either way...

867
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:41,223
...it'll be one hell of a ride.

868
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,893
I'm ready.

869
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,854
