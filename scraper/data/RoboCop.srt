1
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,868
And we're on in four, three,

2
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:56,870
two, one.

3
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,793
What if I told you that even 
the worst neighborhood in America

4
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,962
could be made completely safe.

5
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,048
And what if I told you that
this could be accomplished

6
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:09,341
without risking the life

7
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:12,302
of one single law enforcement officer.

8
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,887
How do I know this?

9
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,181
Because it's happening right now

10
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:18,559
in every country in the world

11
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:20,436
but this one.

12
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,481
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to The Novak Element.

13
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,738
In tonight's State of the Union segment

14
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,865
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe

15
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,159
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

16
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,662
General Monroe, welcome back.

17
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:39,913
Good to see you, Pat.

18
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:44,334
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

19
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:48,130
Could you walk us through
what we're seeing here?

20
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:50,507
Well, this is a routine operation.

21
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,760
We found that random patrols

22
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:56,221
helped the local population 
to feel safer and to trust us.

23
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:57,306
It's amazing.

24
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,725
And what are these colored dots

25
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,310
that we're seeing here, General?

26
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,396
These are our assets
on the ground.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,065
In green,
we got the ED-209s.

28
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,860
They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.

29
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:12,196
Purple are
the smaller EM-208s.

30
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,822
They sweep and mop up.

31
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,867
And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.

32
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,079
It is great to see
American machines

33
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:24,458
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

34
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,293
All right, you guys, this is
a standard op, all right?

35
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:27,753
There's no opposition expected.

36
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:30,005
I'm gonna set your markers
to code red.

37
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,886
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

38
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,096
No red assets
have ever been lost.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,306
Okay.
Okay?

40
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,724
Does that make you feel better?

41
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,726
But, listen,

42
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,561
keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.

43
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:45,729
Okay?

44
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,064
Good. Enjoy the show.

45
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,322
All right. Let's go.

46
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,412
May peace be upon you.

47
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,250
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

48
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,836
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,921
No one will be harmed.

50
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,517
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,270
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,522
No one will be harmed.

53
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:32,734
Scott, get me a shot of this.

54
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,487
Your cooperation is appreciated.

55
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,490
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

56
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,286
May peace be upon you.

57
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,461
Incredible.

58
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,881
Incredible!

59
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:58,302
Not long ago, that would have been 
American men and women

60
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:01,555
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

61
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,850
General, you care
to comment on this?

62
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,394
Well, Pat,
we had Vietnam,

63
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:10,272
we had Iraq,
we had Afghanistan.

64
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:12,024
Never again.

65
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:15,569
From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.

66
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,446
We can accomplish
our objectives

67
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,573
without any loss
to American lives

68
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,993
and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.

69
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,912
And why wouldn't they?

70
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,331
For the first time
in their lives

71
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,750
they get to watch
their children grow up

72
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,712
in an environment
of safety and security.

73
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:35,756
Navid!

74
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,174
Get away from the window!

75
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,343
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

76
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,179
Come here! Come here right now!

77
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,347
Arash!

78
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,391
Navid! You stay with your mom 
and sisters!

79
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,784
- But he's just a kid.
- Sayeh!

80
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,686
Stay here with your mom 
and the kids!

81
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,897
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

82
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,524
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

83
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,779
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

84
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:00,989
Navid!

85
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,532
Shut the door!

86
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,535
We're not here to kill any of them.

87
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,037
Got it?

88
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:10,248
The goal is to die on television.

89
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,349
Let's go!

90
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,543
Kelly!

91
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,295
Can you hear me out there?

92
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:18,298
Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran

93
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:22,636
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

94
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,680
As you can see behind me,
they're working

95
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:26,556
in collaboration with the robots

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,144
and obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

97
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,580
Don't make a move before I say...

98
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,791
I wanna make sure they're recording.

99
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:53,950
Yes!

100
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:54,626
Yes! Yes!

101
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:55,836
We're ready.

102
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,509
You'll notice children

103
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,636
in the streets as well.
This is everyday life

104
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,805
happening in perfect harmony.

105
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,353
Oh, great.
Here, come here.

106
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,563
Stay put,
stay put, stay put.

107
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,306
It's fine. Don't worry.
My guy's got it.

108
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,538
Navid! It's dangerous here!

109
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:32,372
Come away! Come...

110
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:33,874
Navid, where are you going?

111
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,835
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

112
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,295
What are you looking for? Navid!

113
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,881
Navid! Navid! What are you...

114
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,340
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

115
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,108
Oh, my God!

116
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:08,325
Drop your weapon.

117
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,664
Kelly?

118
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,750
Kelly! Are you all right? 
Kelly!

119
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,001
We're okay, Pat.

120
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:20,504
Our robots have just repelled
some suicide bombers.

121
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,297
I'm sorry, Kelly,

122
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,176
but for security reasons the Pentagon's
going to cut our feed to Tehran.

123
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,552
But, please, be careful.

124
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,429
Yeah. I'll continue
to stand by.

125
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,436
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

126
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,313
So then tell me.

127
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,818
Why can't we use these
machines here at home?

128
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:47,948
Why is America so 
robophobic?

129
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,868
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars.

130
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:55,956
An entrepreneur
and true American

131
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,209
whose product just saved
my colleague's life.

132
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,586
And on the other.

133
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,089
Hubert Dreyfus.

134
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:08,218
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

135
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:12,681
whose bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

136
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:15,892
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

137
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:19,521
because they haven't
experienced this technology

138
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:22,732
and they fear
what they don't understand.

139
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,736
We at The Novak Element
support Mr. Sellars' efforts

140
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,157
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

141
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,242
After all,

142
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:36,371
what's more important than 
the safety of the American people?

143
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:05,233
- Hey, Murphy.
- Hey.

144
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:08,862
How's Jack?

145
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,739
We don't know yet.

146
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,949
- Murphy.
- Hey.

147
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,951
- How's it going?
- Good.

148
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,000
What the hell
are they doing here?

149
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,003
Six in the morgue.
Lewis in the hospital.

150
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,005
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

151
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,049
We got a lead on Antoine Vallon, 
we took it.

152
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:30,133
What lead?

153
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,385
Not in front of them.

154
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,804
This is bullshit. Yeah?

155
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,556
Yeah, you got something to say, 
Murphy?

156
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,724
Vallon's our case.

157
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:41,645
Yeah, two years without no arrest, 
no nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

158
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:45,065
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

159
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:47,150
No, it's nothing personal.

160
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,402
Although, I don't
like you as a person.

161
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,488
Okay, you two, out.

162
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,073
No problem.

163
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:55,909
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

164
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,535
your partner would
still be standing.

165
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,454
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

166
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:03,833
Okay, Alex.

167
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,421
It's just you and me now.

168
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,508
So me and Jack, we've been
doin' some street buys.

169
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,176
We get a line on some guns.

170
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,846
We meet up with this
low-level G called Jerry

171
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,474
who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.

172
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,534
Where the hell you get a gun 
like that, Jerry?

173
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,436
I can get you 
two whole crates full, man.

174
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:24,604
Two crates?

175
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:25,772
No disrespect, J,

176
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,691
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

177
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,025
What's it matter
where it comes from?

178
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,778
Why it matters, we don't
want no dirty guns, Jerry.

179
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,697
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

180
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:35,031
Yo, look,
they're clean, all right?

181
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:36,574
You gonna buy
this shit or not?

182
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,118
Why you acting
so nervous, man?

183
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,036
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

184
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,204
What'd you say?

185
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,290
You think he fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.

186
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:44,791
Yo, what the hell
are they talkin' about, man?

187
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,209
Hey, let me see your phone.

188
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,711
Let me see your phone.

189
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,004
I'm not showing you
my phone, man!

190
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,338
You recordin' this?

191
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,090
I think you're
a goddamn cop!

192
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,174
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

193
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,551
I'm not showing you
my phone!

194
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:55,719
Hey! Put your gun down!

195
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,012
Put your phones
on the table.

196
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,014
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

197
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,223
What?

198
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,183
Shut up! Shut up!
What'd you say?

199
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,352
Ends up he works
for Vallon.

200
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,314
Before the meet, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

201
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,649
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

202
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,402
Not out on the street.

203
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:14,654
Intake papers blank.
No signatures.

204
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,073
- What do you got?
- Nothin'.

205
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,743
How do you think
that happened?

206
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,663
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

207
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,750
These guys'll shoot you just
to see if they gun work.

208
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,209
We need backup.

209
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,670
If we call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station.

210
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:32,088
He's gonna disappear.

211
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,923
It's gonna be all right.

212
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:37,010
So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,

213
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:38,345
and he bought it.

214
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:42,432
What do you two need with that
much product? You plotting a coup?

215
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,769
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

216
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:47,854
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

217
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:50,982
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

218
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,942
Hey, boss.

219
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,945
What do you got for me?

220
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:58,740
Really?

221
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:01,618
We were just about to close the deal 
but someone tipped him off.

222
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,204
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

223
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:05,789
Two minutes.

224
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,297
Make sure
you kill 'em both!

225
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:26,059
I got two handguns,
one automatic.

226
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,990
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

227
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:42,450
You sure about this?

228
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:05,807
You ready?

229
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,100
Move.

230
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,808
Lewis!

231
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,852
Lewis!

232
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,400
Officer down!
Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

233
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,027
This is Detective Alex Murphy

234
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,029
in need of immediate
medical assistance.

235
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:03,198
331 Hamilton Road.

236
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,241
Jack.

237
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:09,204
Jack, come on.
Jack. Can you hear me?

238
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,706
Jack. Stay with me.

239
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:13,750
Jack.

240
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:17,587
Alex, you don't do 
something like this

241
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:19,422
unless you bring it
to me first.

242
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:20,924
Vallon's connected.

243
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,886
I'm warning you, don't make any
more moves until I vet this.

244
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:26,763
If officers are
supplying him with guns...

245
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,932
That's up to IAD.

246
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,892
I'll handle it.

247
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:41,236
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

248
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:45,949
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

249
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,493
It can't understand
the value of human life.

250
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:50,078
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

251
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:54,666
To legislate
over life and death,

252
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:58,545
we need people who
understand right from wrong.

253
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,964
What do your machines feel?

254
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,592
Well, they feel no anger.
They feel no prejudice.

255
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,305
They feel no fatigue, which makes
them ideal for law enforcement.

256
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:13,476
Putting these machines
on the streets

257
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,646
will save countless
American lives.

258
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,648
- You're evading the question.
- No, I'm not.

259
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:19,857
Yes, you're evading the question.

260
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:23,403
I asked what do
these machines feel?

261
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,406
If one of them
killed a child,

262
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,950
what would it feel?

263
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,455
Nothing.
And that's the problem.

264
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:39,919
That's why 72% of Americans will not
stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

265
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,888
America is the world's most
valuable market, and we can't touch it.

266
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,477
With a domestic expansion, 
we'd clear $600 billion per annum.

267
00:15:56,644 --> 00:16:01,524
In other words, every second that law is
in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.

268
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:02,792
What do you want me to do?

269
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:06,195
We've thrown cash at senators at both
sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.

270
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:08,381
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

271
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:11,492
So unless we sway public opinion, 
the battle's lost.

272
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,620
Now, to that effect,

273
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:18,041
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

274
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,710
Wow factor off-the-charts.

275
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:23,713
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

276
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,715
A figure
they can rally behind.

277
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,885
Sir, I have dissected this bill.
There are no loopholes.

278
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,720
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

279
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,013
Forget machines.

280
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,556
You saw the polls.

281
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,225
Americans don't want 
a machine.

282
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,062
They want

283
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,898
a product
with a conscience.

284
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,484
They want

285
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,445
something that knows

286
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,990
what it feels like

287
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,533
to be human.

288
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,417
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

289
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:09,050
You're not you because
of your legs, your arms, your hands.

290
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,802
You're you because
of your brain.

291
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:15,306
It's your brain's capacity to process
information that makes you who you are.

292
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:20,937
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

293
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:26,567
I've never played
with these.

294
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:31,072
The music doesn't come from your fingers,
Michael, it comes from your mind.

295
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,199
All you have to do
is let it out.

296
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,284
Please.

297
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,608
Oh, my God.

298
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,531
No, it's okay. Easy.

299
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:18,286
His emotions are peaking. 
The readings are getting clouded.

300
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,620
It's okay.

301
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,623
Relax. If you get
too emotional,

302
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:24,584
it'll change the chemistry
in your brain.

303
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,502
It'll throw the system out.

304
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:32,091
You're doing great.
Come on.

305
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:48,691
I need emotion to play.

306
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:51,652
<i>Concierto de Aranjuez, </i>
second movement.

307
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,530
Beautiful piece.

308
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,408
Bennett, when you have a moment. 
Thank you.

309
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:00,661
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

310
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:04,457
I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

311
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:07,794
My work here is driven
by its own questions.

312
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:11,422
And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

313
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:14,258
Look, I think I found a way

314
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:18,095
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

315
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:21,849
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

316
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,072
You're not keeping up your end,

317
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,490
leaving me exposed
like that.

318
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:39,450
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

319
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:40,701
So put him on the payroll.

320
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:41,786
Why are we talkin'
about this?

321
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,496
It won't work. And now that
his partner got hit,

322
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,498
he's never gonna let it go.

323
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:47,542
- What is that?
- Lewis' hospital.

324
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,001
Alex is dropping by
this afternoon,

325
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:51,170
in case you want
to send flowers.

326
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,592
Yeah.

327
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,135
I kill a cop,

328
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,887
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

329
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,305
That's not good for business.

330
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:04,392
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

331
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,900
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

332
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,613
I'm gonna have 'em in bracelets
within a month, man.

333
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,075
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

334
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,661
Cameras off?

335
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,038
Clear.

336
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:30,918
You were right.
We should've had backup.

337
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,461
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:37,900
You're not really sleeping,
are ya?

339
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:41,554
Asshole.

340
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:48,728
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

341
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:53,190
He has let himself go a little 
since the accident.

342
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:54,483
Pass.

343
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,110
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

344
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,113
Officer Alfred Miller,
Denver.

345
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:02,825
"Severe Cerebellar..."

346
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,493
Cerebellar ataxia.

347
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,245
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

348
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:10,499
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

349
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,368
Let's keep this one in mind. 
I like this guy.

350
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,129
Very good, sir.
I saved the best for last.

351
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,760
I give you Sergeant Jack Freeman, 
masculinity incarnate.

352
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:23,220
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

353
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,389
now confined
to a wheelchair.

354
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,936
I think I can see the appeal.

355
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,020
No.

356
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,980
What? Why?

357
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:36,067
Well, check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

358
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,027
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

359
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,696
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

360
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:44,116
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

361
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,327
We have to be scientific.

362
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,205
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

363
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,083
He's right. Okay.
Keep looking.

364
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:56,921
- David, what did I say?
- Not until you're finished.

365
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:59,090
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Dad.

366
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:02,051
- Hey.
- Hey, little monkey.

367
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,515
How's the game, buddy?

368
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:10,559
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

369
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:13,562
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

370
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,189
Hey, D, why don't
you head upstairs

371
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:16,941
and start getting ready
for bed.

372
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,776
But he just got home.

373
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:20,861
I'll be up in a second.

374
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,406
Tuck you in, okay?
All right?

375
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:29,161
- Now give your mom a kiss.
- Good night, baby.

376
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:30,538
Too slow, boy.

377
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,125
You're just too slow.

378
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,217
How's Jack holding up?

379
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:45,845
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

380
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:47,680
It's my fault.

381
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:49,140
We shouldn't even
have been there.

382
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:52,810
Here.

383
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,918
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

384
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,377
It'll stop.

385
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,427
It's gonna wake up David.

386
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,684
He suffered 4th degree
burns over 80% of his body.

387
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:59,687
Lower spine
has been severed.

388
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:02,565
If he survives,

389
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:07,236
he'll be paralyzed from the waist down 
and confined to a wheelchair.

390
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,699
Mrs. Murphy,

391
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,786
we don't have to do this.

392
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:20,166
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

393
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,920
Please continue.

394
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:28,048
Vestibulocochlear,

395
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:31,218
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

396
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:34,388
He'll be blind in one eye.

397
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:36,473
Most likely deaf.

398
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,685
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

399
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:41,270
are the leaders
in this field.

400
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:45,024
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

401
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,568
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

402
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:51,655
I'm sorry, Doctor.

403
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,658
I need time to think.

404
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:58,746
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

405
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,628
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

406
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,841
What kind of life
will he have?

407
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:30,194
- Thanks.
- Thanks, buddy.

408
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,154
You know she's gonna
make me dance again.

409
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,989
Now that I've gotta see.

410
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,157
You don't want to see that.

411
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,909
Here she comes now.

412
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,202
Hold on to that.

413
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:39,536
Get out there, partner.

414
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,831
Every time.

415
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:47,753
Get her, boy.

416
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,190
Subject is still dreaming.

417
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,110
He's retrieving memories,

418
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:14,613
trying to make sense of sensorial
stimulation package 37.

419
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,157
Perfect, Kim.

420
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,661
Let's reconnect the spine.

421
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,163
Time to wake him up.

422
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,191
Excuse me?

423
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,402
What are you doing here?

424
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:55,154
Baby, where you going?

425
00:27:58,615 --> 00:27:59,742
Lewis.

426
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,630
Subject regaining
cognitive functions.

427
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,800
What's happening?

428
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,220
Where am I?

429
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:24,892
You were in an explosion, Alex.
You're in a hospital.

430
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:29,813
Where's Clara? My wife.
Where's my wife?

431
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,316
I want you to calm down, Alex. 
Listen to me.

432
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:36,070
You're okay. And your family's fine.
Both your wife and your son.

433
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,364
Who the hell are you?

434
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:41,533
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.

435
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:43,285
Heart rate rising.

436
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,414
I can't move.

437
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,586
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?

438
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:53,879
Visual input unstable.

439
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,464
I want you to relax, Alex.

440
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:56,924
Subject's dumping
too much epinephrine.

441
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,384
- Should we purge it?
- Not yet.

442
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:01,011
Unlock vertebrae.

443
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,351
Go ahead, Kim.

444
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:10,938
Unlock upper,
lower extremities.

445
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:25,702
What kind of suit is this?

446
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,373
It's not a suit, Alex.

447
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,751
It's you.

448
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,338
This was the only option.

449
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:40,008
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

450
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:41,969
Full body unlock.

451
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,430
I want you
to walk now, Alex.

452
00:29:44,513 --> 00:29:46,098
You can do that.

453
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,623
This seems so real.

454
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:16,420
Alex, it's very important

455
00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:18,088
you understand
what is happening.

456
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:19,548
This is real.

457
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:22,801
It's not a dream, it's not
drugs or anesthetics.

458
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,804
I know I'm dreaming 'cause
I can feel all of this.

459
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:28,932
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

460
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,309
It's called
phantom limb sensation.

461
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:31,643
What do you mean "amputees"?

462
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,979
- What the hell did you do to me?
- You need to relax.

463
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,439
Take this off me now.

464
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:38,066
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

465
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:40,194
What have you done to me?

466
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,696
Alex? Hey!

467
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:45,073
Shut him down.

468
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,784
No! Let him run!
Let him run!

469
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,640
Where am I?

470
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:35,707
Alex, please.

471
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:38,544
Stop.

472
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,296
Alex, you have to stop.

473
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:43,966
Please.

474
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:46,218
Alex.

475
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:49,221
Please stop.

476
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,223
Stay where you are

477
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,142
and we'll come
and pick you up.

478
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:29,136
Okay, Kim.

479
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,763
Shut him down.

480
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,207
Alex,

481
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,752
you can't run from this.

482
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:07,924
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

483
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:12,763
Show me.

484
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:16,141
Kim.

485
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,367
Oh!

486
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:36,828
No.

487
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,584
Holy Christ.

488
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,961
Holy Christ.

489
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,424
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

490
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:59,226
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

491
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:07,401
That's not even my brain.

492
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,696
We had to repair
the damaged areas.

493
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,990
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

494
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:16,618
Do you understand me, Alex?

495
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:20,080
You're in control.

496
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:23,333
- I'm in control?
- Yes.

497
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:27,379
Okay.

498
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:32,884
If I'm in control,

499
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:36,012
then I wanna die.

500
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:42,769
Just unplug whatever it is keepin' me 
alive and end this nightmare.

501
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,147
Now, say I did that.

502
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,858
Which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

503
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:49,943
but say I did.

504
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,072
What do I say
to your wife?

505
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,283
What does she say
to your son?

506
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,119
That it didn't work.
That you tried.

507
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,830
Somethin' went wrong.

508
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:05,709
You did everything
you could,

509
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,005
but I died.

510
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,007
So after all
they've been through,

511
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,427
all the pain,
all their hope restored,

512
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,721
we would just
rip that away?

513
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:21,308
Your wife loves you, Alex.

514
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:23,560
She signed
the consent forms herself.

515
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:26,980
Otherwise, you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

516
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:41,787
She loves you and 
she gave you a second chance.

517
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,583
I need you to take it.

518
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:53,548
I don't wanna see myself
like this again.

519
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,176
Even

520
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:58,512
And the same goes
for my family.

521
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,979
Just put me back in.

522
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:13,610
Zoom in.

523
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:17,197
Stop.

524
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:21,284
Zoom in.

525
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,996
Stop.

526
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:31,795
Accept the connection.

527
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,344
It's so good
to finally see you.

528
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,847
I was gonna say
the same thing.

529
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,474
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,811
I know how I must
look to you.

531
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,313
I think you look beautiful.

532
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:56,111
Are they treating you okay,
baby?

533
00:36:56,278 --> 00:37:00,699
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

534
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,202
Does David know
you're calling?

535
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,249
He misses you.

536
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,127
- I can go get him.
- No.

537
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,672
I don't want him
to see me like this.

538
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:18,925
Not yet.

539
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,302
Sure.

540
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,685
We're gonna
get through this, baby.

541
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,773
We're gonna make it
like it was.

542
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,821
When are you comin' home?

543
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:42,324
Well, they've still
got some tests.

544
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,535
But they're sayin'
it's goin' really well.

545
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:48,955
The minute they let me.

546
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:52,918
I gotta go.

547
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,337
I love you.

548
00:37:55,503 --> 00:37:57,130
End the connection.

549
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,357
Okay,
blood cleansing initiated.

550
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,737
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

551
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:26,409
Releasing proteins, fats,

552
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:29,371
minerals and carbs.

553
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:36,586
Energy inflow
is at 1320 kilocalories.

554
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:42,342
Now starting anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones

555
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,428
and antibiotic protocols.

556
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:48,056
Standard daily intake.

557
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,602
Release antidepressants.

558
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,106
Let's give him a nice dream.

559
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,943
All right, here's
what you're dealin' with.

560
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,538
Modified M2 battle rifle.

561
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:14,082
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

562
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:16,001
Three-shot bursts
or full auto.

563
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:18,378
Heavy-duty.

564
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:22,841
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven
taser pistol.

565
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:27,345
Each projectile releases up to
200,000 volts. It can stun, it can kill

566
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:28,888
and it's nasty shit.

567
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,306
Your armor,

568
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,725
state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

569
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,436
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and kill.

570
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:38,314
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

571
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,627
If you sense you need a
weapon or are threatened

572
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,657
the visor goes down and the system
makes the weapons available.

573
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:50,702
But you gotta remember, 
it's not the weapons that count.

574
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:51,828
It's who's handling them.

575
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,122
Or, in your case, what.

576
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,042
- You think you can do this?
- Oh, just stick to your job.

577
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,003
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

578
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,257
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.

579
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:06,468
You ask me, stickin'
organics into the system

580
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,636
is a huge step backwards.

581
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:11,014
I don't care how well you
designed this thing.

582
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:13,475
Without my sign-off, it better
start learnin' Chinese,

583
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,018
'cause it ain't
never goin' home.

584
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,444
It's nice to meet you, too.

585
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,447
Let's do this,

586
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:29,074
Tin Man.

587
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:39,417
Quality control,
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

588
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:42,504
Rendering scenario one now.

589
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:44,964
Hey, Doc,
hope you don't mind.

590
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,174
I like a little music
while I'm workin'.

591
00:40:50,386 --> 00:40:55,350
All right. All right, let's let the
games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.

592
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:58,520
Commence scenario.

593
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:34,347
Laggin' on the comers.

594
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,932
No, there,
d'you see that?

595
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,892
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

596
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:41,437
New product's afraid.

597
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:45,650
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

598
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:48,528
Don't shoot! He has a gun!

599
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:49,654
Drop your gun!

600
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:53,116
Drop your gun!

601
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:55,577
Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!

602
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,913
Oh, well, it's worried that
the kid's gonna get hurt.

603
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,582
- Let the kid go!
- Too bad.

604
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:06,087
Well, there you have it. 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

605
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:08,131
I wouldn't buy that
for a dollar.

606
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:16,014
- Let's do it again.
- Your funeral.

607
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:20,894
Detective Alex Murphy.

608
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,270
<i>Search results.</i>

609
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,397
<i>"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."</i>

610
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:26,691
<i>"Alex Murphy.
Man or Machine?"</i>

611
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:30,236
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>

612
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,864
Antoine Vallon.

613
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:34,032
<i>Search results.</i>

614
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:38,244
"DPD says Antoine Vallon no longer
suspect due to lack of evidence."

615
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:43,666
Detroit Free Press.

616
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,920
Unfortunately, Murphy's investigation 
into Antoine Vallon

617
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:48,421
wasn't authorized
in the first place.

618
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:52,217
Look, Detective Murphy was
simply overzealous, okay?

619
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,428
We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.

620
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:57,805
All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.

621
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:01,392
And I won't rest until the men who tried
to kill him are brought to justice.

622
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:06,272
What's wrong with him?

623
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:07,440
No, nothing, nothing.

624
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:12,028
Watch the procedural bars
on the 208.

625
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:16,407
The machine assesses
the threat and acts.

626
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:18,409
That's it.

627
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,287
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

628
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,417
The software assesses the threat, 
just like the robot.

629
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,461
And it sends the information
to the brain.

630
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:31,381
Alex's brain receives the information
and decides what to do with it

631
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:36,094
based on his emotional cognitive
abilities like any man would.

632
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:39,430
Then the brain relates this
to the Al module and...

633
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:42,308
Yeah, like, you know,
a year later.

634
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:43,701
And our computers
finish the job.

635
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:47,438
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

636
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:49,107
And that's what you've got.

637
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,317
But the human element
will always be present.

638
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:53,987
Fear, instinct,
bias, compassion,

639
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,321
they will always interfere
with the system!

640
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:56,948
Okay, but, Dennett,

641
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,451
I've gotta give the American people
something they can root for.

642
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:02,287
Something aspirational, right?

643
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,788
They have to believe 
in this thing.

644
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,375
"Pretty good"? I don't know 
how to sell "okay."

645
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,085
We, you and I,
have got a release date,

646
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:10,586
and we've gotta make it, okay?

647
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,256
So I don't care how you do it. 
I'm askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

648
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:16,801
Just get him to do that.
Get him to do that.

649
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:18,303
That is a machine.

650
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:19,846
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

651
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:22,807
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

652
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:23,975
And his life depends on it.

653
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:25,435
And the future of Omnicorp
depends on it

654
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:28,354
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

655
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:30,606
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

656
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,167
It tastes like
peanut butter.

657
00:44:53,129 --> 00:44:55,298
I can't get it
out of my mouth.

658
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,759
And you don't like peanut butter?

659
00:44:57,925 --> 00:44:59,135
No.

660
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:01,471
You like peanut butter, Kim?

661
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:03,056
I love it.

662
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,184
Okay.

663
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:08,811
I'm gonna put you
to sleep now, Alex.

664
00:45:08,895 --> 00:45:09,979
Okay.

665
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,232
Now, put him under, Kim.

666
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,323
What are you planning to do?

667
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:25,203
Consciousness
is nothing more

668
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,081
than the processing
of information.

669
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,459
I'm gonna fix him.

670
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,962
And he won't know the difference.

671
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:47,892
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

672
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:51,437
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

673
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:55,400
We call this Combat Mode.

674
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:58,277
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

675
00:45:58,444 --> 00:45:59,570
Yeah, that's okay.

676
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,489
And get a load of this.

677
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,077
What's that? He transforms.
Kids love it.

678
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:08,746
Really? Focus group
numbers through the roof.

679
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:10,248
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

680
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,375
Well, that's really
embarrassing.

681
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,502
What is this?
You know what?

682
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:16,504
People really don't know
what they want

683
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:18,798
until you show it to 'em
most of the time.

684
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:21,884
Make him more, uh,

685
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:22,969
tactical.

686
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:24,595
Make him look, uh...

687
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:28,516
Let's go with black.

688
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,018
Yeah.

689
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:07,180
Alex.

690
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:09,432
He looks like a billion dollars.

691
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,559
2.6 billion.

692
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:13,728
Raymond Sellars.

693
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:15,938
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

694
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:18,107
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

695
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:20,401
Well, we funded this program

696
00:47:20,485 --> 00:47:22,695
to give men like you
a second chance.

697
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,323
You just do
your best today.

698
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:26,949
- Shall we?
- Let's.

699
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:32,538
- Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.
- Okay, great.

700
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:34,165
Chief Technician Shuman.

701
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:35,708
Mornin', folks.

702
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,047
Okay, so this is how it's gonna be.

703
00:47:41,214 --> 00:47:43,508
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

704
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:46,219
I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.

705
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:48,804
You hit me,
you get a ticket back home.

706
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:52,642
My guys are gonna be
shootin' .47 caliber rounds.

707
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:54,977
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

708
00:47:55,144 --> 00:47:58,481
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

709
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:15,081
Alex, listen to me.

710
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:17,875
The EM-208s will try to 
maneuver you

711
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:19,293
so Mattox can get a clear shot.

712
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:22,505
Do not let that happen.

713
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,967
If Mattox hits you, everything but
your life support will shut down.

714
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,178
You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.

715
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:32,181
- I don't know about that.
- I've been through a lot.

716
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:39,438
All right.

717
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:42,149
I say we go on three.

718
00:48:42,316 --> 00:48:43,317
Three.

719
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:06,882
How's it going down there?

720
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,013
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

721
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:16,517
Wow.

722
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:51,510
Dr. Norton,
how is he doing this?

723
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:55,806
 His software is faster.
His hardware is stronger.

724
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:57,475
He's a better machine.

725
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:02,313
But you said
humans hesitate.

726
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,774
Only when they're
making decisions.

727
00:50:04,857 --> 00:50:06,817
He's not making decisions?

728
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:08,736
Yes and no.

729
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:12,031
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

730
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:14,158
Alex makes his own decisions.

731
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:16,369
Now, when he
engages in battle,

732
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:19,664
the visor comes down
and the software takes over.

733
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,791
Then the machine
does everything.

734
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:25,211
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

735
00:50:28,756 --> 00:50:30,132
But if the machine
is in control,

736
00:50:30,216 --> 00:50:31,634
then how is Murphy
accountable?

737
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:32,843
Who's pulling the trigger?

738
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:34,303
Well, when the machine fights,

739
00:50:34,387 --> 00:50:36,889
the system releases signals
into Alex's brain

740
00:50:36,972 --> 00:50:39,558
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

741
00:50:39,642 --> 00:50:42,478
I mean, Alex believes 
right now he is in control.

742
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:46,023
But he's not. It's the illusion 
of free will.

743
00:50:55,741 --> 00:50:56,826
Crap!

744
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:22,101
So you've circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

745
00:51:22,184 --> 00:51:23,185
But that's illegal.

746
00:51:23,352 --> 00:51:25,146
No. No, no, no.

747
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:28,649
It's a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.

748
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:30,109
And in my book

749
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,069
that's legal.

750
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,197
Well done.

751
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,242
Well done.

752
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:46,083
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

753
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:50,463
I, uh, I think we're all
curious to find out.

754
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:51,964
Go ahead.

755
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:31,378
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

756
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:34,215
She's been waiting
four months.

757
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:36,550
I'm sure hers is, too.

758
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,721
You're gonna do fine.

759
00:52:50,397 --> 00:52:52,358
I love your sign, D.

760
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:56,821
Hey.

761
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,910
There's nothin' to be
nervous about.

762
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:08,833
Thank you, Bennett.

763
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,335
It's been a privilege.

764
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:47,181
Hi, Dad.

765
00:54:50,142 --> 00:54:51,852
You know
I missed you, buddy.

766
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:54,188
Me, too.

767
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:02,821
Wanna feel it?

768
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,993
What is it?

769
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,871
It's okay, sweetie.

770
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:25,135
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

771
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,554
You did?

772
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:32,518
- How'd they do?
- I don't know.

773
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:34,895
I've been waiting
to watch them with you.

774
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:38,148
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

775
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,567
But I can't tonight.

776
00:55:41,235 --> 00:55:43,570
You know, 'cause Daddy's
suit needs some...

777
00:55:44,738 --> 00:55:46,532
Some special handling.

778
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:49,576
Do you understand?

779
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:22,192
Thanks for coming, Jack.

780
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,944
I heard you
went home already.

781
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:25,779
I know Clara must be
thrilled to have you back.

782
00:56:25,863 --> 00:56:28,115
I saw Clara

783
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,450
and David.

784
00:56:32,244 --> 00:56:34,455
That ain't my home right now.

785
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:37,875
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

786
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,752
I'm sorry, Alex.

787
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:43,964
Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take down 
Vallon and his whole damn crew.

788
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:45,924
I was waitin'
to hear you say that.

789
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,222
Least I know
you're the right color now.

790
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:27,299
Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today

791
00:57:27,382 --> 00:57:29,551
certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.

792
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:32,096
We're expecting people
from every corner of the city

793
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,430
here in Detroit

794
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:35,390
to come out and
show their support

795
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:36,725
for Detective Alex Murphy.

796
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:40,354
You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is what will he look like.

797
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,272
Is he a changed man?

798
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:44,108
Rumor has it
he is in the building

799
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,692
preparing to come out...

800
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:51,824
Alex, we're gonna upload the entire
DPD database into your brain.

801
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:56,787
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records

802
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,041
plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

803
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,209
All right.

804
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,336
Hit me.

805
00:58:04,962 --> 00:58:07,214
Okay. Kim,
it's all yours.

806
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:11,468
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

807
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:14,221
Your system draws
connections automatically.

808
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,140
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes

809
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:19,560
and give you their exact
locations whenever available.

810
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:23,397
I got evidence
to make 138... No, no.

811
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,899
166 arrests.

812
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,610
His emotions are stable.

813
00:58:30,237 --> 00:58:31,822
This is incredible.

814
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:34,992
You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.

815
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,161
The mayor is standing
onstage behind me.

816
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:39,413
Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.

817
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:40,747
They seem like great friends

818
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:43,750
obviously echoing the partnership
that they've brought together.

819
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:46,336
How much longer
will this take?

820
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,506
Well, the feed from the
database is almost clone, so.

821
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:51,258
We're approaching
present day.

822
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:54,845
634 pending arrests.

823
00:58:54,928 --> 00:58:57,347
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

824
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:00,934
He's on top of her.

825
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:02,853
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

826
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:04,521
- I gotta do something!
- Alex.

827
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:06,773
Alex, calm down.

828
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:08,692
Take a breath.

829
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:10,360
Relax.

830
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:11,862
Kim, what are the readings?

831
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:13,739
I haven't seen him
at levels like this.

832
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:15,190
- He's gonna shoot 'em!
- Alex!

833
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,492
Alex, Alex, relax.

834
00:59:18,452 --> 00:59:19,453
Relax.

835
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:21,455
Alex?

836
00:59:22,122 --> 00:59:24,124
- What is this?
- This just a computer glitch?

837
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,043
No. That's his own 
crime scene.

838
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:27,127
Alex!

839
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:29,463
- He's spiking all over the place.
- Alex!

840
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,882
- Alex?
- The system is crashing, Doctor.

841
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:33,133
Alex, can you hear me?

842
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:34,718
Alex! Alex!

843
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:37,054
I'm not sure he can handle this.
I gotta do something!

844
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:38,338
He's emotionally overloaded.

845
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:39,389
Unlock me!

846
00:59:39,556 --> 00:59:40,974
Alex! Stop!

847
00:59:41,475 --> 00:59:43,101
Stop! He's having a seizure!

848
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:45,145
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

849
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:46,480
Get me a live feed!

850
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:47,731
I can't do it.
Dr. Norton's with the patient.

851
00:59:47,814 --> 00:59:48,815
Do it now!

852
00:59:48,982 --> 00:59:50,108
Jesus Christ!

853
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:51,902
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

854
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:53,445
What?
The press is waiting!

855
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:54,613
We have to
get him up there now!

856
00:59:54,696 --> 00:59:55,822
What do you
want me to do?

857
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:58,784
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

858
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:02,204
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

859
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:05,165
We're running out of time.

860
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:07,251
Okay.

861
01:00:08,669 --> 01:00:10,087
Everybody out!

862
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:12,673
Out!

863
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:14,258
Mayor Durant is
about to take to the stage

864
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:17,928
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

865
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:21,265
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

866
01:00:25,811 --> 01:00:28,063
Heart rate rising. He
might start spiking, Doctor.

867
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:30,774
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

868
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:32,025
But you will be
taking away his emotions.

869
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,860
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

870
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:35,946
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

871
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,656
Now, please!

872
01:00:43,036 --> 01:00:45,539
Pull the footage.
Put it on a loop.

873
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:49,376
Dopamine level's at 20%.

874
01:00:49,543 --> 01:00:50,544
More.

875
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,298
Dopamine level's at 10%.

876
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:55,507
More.

877
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,343
- Dopamine level's at 5%.
- Lower.

878
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,387
- You're flattening him out.
- Lower!

879
01:01:03,056 --> 01:01:05,058
- 2%.
- Hold it there.

880
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:13,400
Alex?

881
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:16,737
Alex, how do you feel?

882
01:01:20,741 --> 01:01:22,826
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

883
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:28,915
Well, today I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

884
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:32,711
I am here to give you 
the cure.

885
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:33,920
That's right!

886
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:42,721
Hi, Dad!

887
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:46,183
Dad?

888
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now

889
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,945
with Detective Alex Murphy!

890
01:02:16,004 --> 01:02:17,005
Detective.

891
01:02:31,978 --> 01:02:34,314
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

892
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:37,317
I think he's
accessing criminal data.

893
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:45,951
Thomas King!
You are under arrest!

894
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,722
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

895
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:11,351
wanted for rape, arson,
and murder.

896
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:15,522
This man has torn apart 
American families.

897
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:19,234
On the loose for six years.

898
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:25,532
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

899
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:33,665
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

900
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:38,378
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

901
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:42,466
These two officers
are completely unaware

902
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:45,552
of the monster
in their midst.

903
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:50,432
And then, in 60 seconds...

904
01:03:50,557 --> 01:03:54,519
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

905
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:58,190
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

906
01:03:58,273 --> 01:04:02,152
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

907
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:08,116
This, my friends, is the future of 
American justice.

908
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:11,953
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

909
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:15,207
now that RoboCop is here?

910
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:17,167
Yes,

911
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,755
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

912
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:26,176
Men weren't up to the task.

913
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:27,802
But Alex Murphy,

914
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:30,138
<i>a robot cop,</i>

915
01:04:30,222 --> 01:04:31,264
was.

916
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:33,850
We can't take him
off the street.

917
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:35,477
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.

918
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,270
A big, fat, stinking hit.

919
01:04:37,354 --> 01:04:39,606
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

920
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,901
Hey, we all knew there would be issues.
It's inevitable.

921
01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:45,654
Dennett, you're my guy. I just
need you to get a handle on this.

922
01:04:45,737 --> 01:04:46,863
I know,
but I need more time.

923
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:49,449
Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

924
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:51,701
We need to take him
backtothelab and do more tests.

925
01:04:51,785 --> 01:04:55,205
I mean, it was like something was
interfering with our system.

926
01:04:55,288 --> 01:04:57,707
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

927
01:04:57,874 --> 01:04:59,709
Like what? His soul?

928
01:04:59,793 --> 01:05:02,295
Hey, look, this train has
already left the station.

929
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,673
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

930
01:05:04,756 --> 01:05:07,259
"Sorry, I released
a defective product."

931
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:10,303
So, no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

932
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,055
What about the interviews?

933
01:05:12,138 --> 01:05:14,558
Cancel 'em.
Cancel all of 'em.

934
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:16,059
Everything.

935
01:05:16,768 --> 01:05:18,478
In fact, Dennett.

936
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:23,817
Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.

937
01:05:24,985 --> 01:05:26,152
I'd like to see him.

938
01:05:27,112 --> 01:05:28,446
Can you arrange that?

939
01:05:28,613 --> 01:05:30,448
Look, I won't lie to you.

940
01:05:30,991 --> 01:05:34,411
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

941
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:37,247
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

942
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,293
And then he just shoots a man in front
of our son. That's not sedation.

943
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,630
He's responding
to drugs differently now.

944
01:05:47,632 --> 01:05:49,968
We both knew from day one,

945
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:53,138
there would be complications.

946
01:05:57,434 --> 01:05:59,477
Just give me
a little more time.

947
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:02,022
I promise,

948
01:06:03,148 --> 01:06:05,150
you'll have your husband back.

949
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,156
This goes for every
squad in every department.

950
01:06:11,323 --> 01:06:14,784
Detective Murphy will have 
full access to all investigations.

951
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:17,495
Robberies,
narcotics, homicides.

952
01:06:17,662 --> 01:06:20,123
If he requests
to take over a case,

953
01:06:20,206 --> 01:06:21,791
the case will be
handed to him.

954
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,710
No arguments,
no complaints.

955
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:24,878
This is bullshit!

956
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:28,840
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

957
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:32,552
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

958
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,847
I've selected 13 targets for today, 
all wanted for murder.

959
01:06:36,222 --> 01:06:37,891
John Biggs
is target number one.

960
01:06:38,058 --> 01:06:39,392
I'll be
taking over this case.

961
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:41,311
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

962
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:43,980
should be ready to
move in on my request.

963
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:46,191
I wish you all
a very good day.

964
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:54,741
Murphy.

965
01:06:55,408 --> 01:06:56,826
You okay, man?

966
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:00,372
I'm fine, Sergeant.

967
01:07:00,914 --> 01:07:02,707
Can't wait to
get back to work.

968
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:04,668
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

969
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,419
Excuse me,
I have casework.

970
01:07:59,305 --> 01:08:00,974
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

971
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,274
Walter Karrel,
look at me.

972
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:10,734
You have two options.

973
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,901
Option one.

974
01:08:12,944 --> 01:08:14,821
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

975
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:18,324
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

976
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:20,827
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control.

977
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,704
And then I arrest you.

978
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:24,330
Option two.
You tell me where

979
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:26,750
John Biggs' drug lab is located.

980
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,918
And then I arrest you.

981
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:31,963
You have
two seconds to decide.

982
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,991
Totally justifiable.

983
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,410
We are going to make
a lot of money.

984
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:48,248
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

985
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:51,751
No traces of anger
whatsoever.

986
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:54,337
Congratulations, Doctor.

987
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:56,005
You did it.

988
01:09:57,257 --> 01:09:58,758
Yes, I did.

989
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,393
I told you, sir.

990
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,354
Norton clearly never had
control of the product.

991
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:14,440
I agree. And that's why 
I called you here.

992
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:17,443
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

993
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,611
Okay.

994
01:10:18,778 --> 01:10:20,655
I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head

995
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,866
plus full surveillance of the lab, and...

996
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,451
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

997
01:10:25,618 --> 01:10:27,453
If anything comes up,

998
01:10:27,537 --> 01:10:29,247
I'm gonna be in Washington.

999
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:34,586
He brought peace

1000
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:37,213
to this country's most violent city.

1001
01:10:37,463 --> 01:10:38,464
He showed us all

1002
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:41,634
that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.

1003
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,638
A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.

1004
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:49,976
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

1005
01:10:50,143 --> 01:10:53,730
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1006
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:57,150
- Hello, Pat.
- Raymond.

1007
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:58,234
Thanks for havin' me.

1008
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:00,904
You must be doing
a victory lap about now.

1009
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:01,988
Well.

1010
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:05,992
Two weeks ago, Omni's stock
went through the roof.

1011
01:11:06,117 --> 01:11:08,411
And the Senate
has finally agreed

1012
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:10,455
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1013
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, look, I mean, 
the tide is definitely turning.

1014
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,003
I just feel certain that soon 
we'll be keeping all Americans safe.

1015
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:18,087
I certainly hope so.

1016
01:11:18,463 --> 01:11:21,424
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.

1017
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:22,508
Mmm-hmm.

1018
01:11:22,842 --> 01:11:23,968
Hubert Dreyfus.

1019
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,346
Senator,
thank you for joining us.

1020
01:11:26,512 --> 01:11:28,222
- Hello, Pat.
- Mr. Sellars.

1021
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:30,600
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1022
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:33,519
The American public
is divided

1023
01:11:33,645 --> 01:11:35,021
on the Dreyfus Act.

1024
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:40,318
Our polls at Novakelement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1025
01:11:40,526 --> 01:11:44,280
There is no doubt
Omnicorp created a sensation

1026
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:47,784
but this bill is not about 
Alex Murphy.

1027
01:11:47,951 --> 01:11:50,912
It's about whether America's
willing to give robots

1028
01:11:50,995 --> 01:11:52,622
the authority
over human lives.

1029
01:11:52,705 --> 01:11:54,290
No. Look, look, look.

1030
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,043
This sea change
we're witnessing,

1031
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:58,544
and it is a sea change,

1032
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,296
shows that Americans
don't really care

1033
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:03,132
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1034
01:12:03,216 --> 01:12:06,260
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

1035
01:12:06,344 --> 01:12:07,595
You're clouding the issue.

1036
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,222
This is clearly an attempt

1037
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:11,724
to sway public opinion
with a marketing stunt.

1038
01:12:11,891 --> 01:12:13,226
What's clear is

1039
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:16,854
that with just one system in place, 
we've cut crime by 80%.

1040
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:18,982
Just imagine if we put,

1041
01:12:19,065 --> 01:12:21,275
I dunno, let's say
100 systems in place.

1042
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:23,403
And then,
I want you to ask yourself,

1043
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:25,279
why are you holding us back?

1044
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:26,698
- Is that your plan?
- Thank you, Senator.

1045
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,591
- And thank you, Raymond.
- Thank you, Pat.

1046
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:31,577
Well, there you have it.

1047
01:12:32,245 --> 01:12:34,163
Who could argue with that?

1048
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:36,207
Which begs the question.

1049
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,462
Has the US Senate
become pro-crime?

1050
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:52,306
Yeah, hi.

1051
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,100
No, no, 5000.

1052
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,935
Call me tomorrow.

1053
01:12:57,353 --> 01:13:00,606
Hey, guys. Vallon's
waitin' for you inside.

1054
01:13:02,108 --> 01:13:03,484
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1055
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:05,028
I'm out here makin' money.

1056
01:13:05,278 --> 01:13:08,031
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

1057
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:10,783
- What took you so long?
- What the hell is all this shit?

1058
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,201
I can't move any product

1059
01:13:12,285 --> 01:13:13,786
with this thing
on the streets.

1060
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,997
What are you doing
to protect me?

1061
01:13:16,164 --> 01:13:18,124
Relax. The guy's
a walkin' zombie.

1062
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,792
And tell me
your phones are off.

1063
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:22,128
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

1064
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:24,464
He can't manufacture
evidence outta thin air.

1065
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,340
If he does,
I'm ready for him.

1066
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:36,142
Well?

1067
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:41,314
I've been getting calls.

1068
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:42,648
From whom?

1069
01:13:43,316 --> 01:13:44,692
Well, Clara.

1070
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:48,488
You need to let her see her husband.
She has rights.

1071
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:52,033
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

1072
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:54,702
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1073
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:56,662
before she turns up
on television.

1074
01:13:56,996 --> 01:13:58,498
Well, she can try.

1075
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:02,043
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1076
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:04,879
I'd hop to it.

1077
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:08,299
Alex. Alex!

1078
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:13,471
Alex. You need to come home.

1079
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:15,014
Clara, please stand aside.

1080
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:16,516
You need to speak
to your son.

1081
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:18,643
Right now, I see three crimes 
in progress.

1082
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,228
Alex, listen to me.

1083
01:14:21,687 --> 01:14:22,688
I know you're in there.

1084
01:14:25,149 --> 01:14:27,360
David won't show
his face at school.

1085
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:29,821
He's having nightmares.

1086
01:14:31,656 --> 01:14:34,367
He's falling apart.
I am falling apart.

1087
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,869
Please.

1088
01:14:38,704 --> 01:14:40,748
I can't do this on my own.

1089
01:14:41,249 --> 01:14:44,377
He's been scared
ever since that night.

1090
01:14:53,845 --> 01:14:55,196
What do you think
she's gonna do?

1091
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,723
What's he gonna do?

1092
01:15:18,578 --> 01:15:19,912
Are you okay?

1093
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:22,081
David? David.

1094
01:15:22,915 --> 01:15:25,251
Stand back.
Come on, stand back!

1095
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,773
He's supposed to be
watching this.

1096
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:52,528
Instead, he's accessing images of
Clara and David arriving at school.

1097
01:15:52,612 --> 01:15:53,905
Over and over again.

1098
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:58,659
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

1099
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,255
- Do you want me to shut him down?
- No.

1100
01:16:11,422 --> 01:16:12,798
Not yet.

1101
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,010
I wanna see what happens.

1102
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:37,865
What's he doing
at his house?

1103
01:16:39,992 --> 01:16:42,036
Look, he's disobeying
protocol.

1104
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:43,371
You have to shut him down.

1105
01:16:43,663 --> 01:16:46,624
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1106
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:48,894
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

1107
01:17:50,688 --> 01:17:53,107
He's undoing
what we did to him.

1108
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:56,235
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

1109
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:58,863
How is that even possible?

1110
01:18:00,072 --> 01:18:02,366
I haven't the faintest idea.

1111
01:18:02,742 --> 01:18:04,076
Alex.

1112
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:32,938
Alex, please return
to the station.

1113
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:35,775
I wanna run some tests.

1114
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:38,277
Well, this should be 
interesting.

1115
01:18:55,294 --> 01:18:56,462
And your phone
on the table!

1116
01:18:56,587 --> 01:18:58,798
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1117
01:18:58,964 --> 01:19:01,175
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

1118
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:03,803
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1119
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:33,958
My hand, man!

1120
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,209
Where's Antoine Vallon?

1121
01:19:35,334 --> 01:19:36,544
You broke my hand, man!

1122
01:19:37,336 --> 01:19:39,213
I know you remember me, Jerry.

1123
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:44,427
Where's Vallon?

1124
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,594
Wait a minute.

1125
01:19:45,678 --> 01:19:47,847
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1126
01:19:49,974 --> 01:19:53,227
Your wife left you in 2019 after
filing charges for domestic abuse.

1127
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:55,187
And you don't have a kid.

1128
01:19:55,646 --> 01:19:56,605
But I do.

1129
01:19:58,232 --> 01:19:59,483
I'm not askin' again!

1130
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:01,735
Look, I swear, man. I don't know 
where Vallon is, okay?

1131
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:05,239
The only guy I talk to is his driver 
Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!

1132
01:20:05,823 --> 01:20:07,700
Does he have a phone number?

1133
01:20:24,049 --> 01:20:27,261
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

1134
01:20:27,428 --> 01:20:28,429
What's he doing?

1135
01:20:28,596 --> 01:20:30,723
He's off solving
his own murder.

1136
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:33,642
Oh, that is genius.

1137
01:20:34,059 --> 01:20:35,686
Why didn't I think of that?

1138
01:20:42,735 --> 01:20:44,236
How long till he gets here?

1139
01:20:44,403 --> 01:20:46,405
- Five minutes.
- All right.

1140
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,449
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

1141
01:20:48,616 --> 01:20:49,909
What happened?

1142
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:53,913
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

1143
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:56,373
Shit.

1144
01:21:04,632 --> 01:21:06,258
All right, everyone,
listen up!

1145
01:21:06,634 --> 01:21:07,927
He's coming.

1146
01:21:08,093 --> 01:21:10,930
He leaves alive, you don't.

1147
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:13,766
How do we stop him?

1148
01:21:15,142 --> 01:21:18,312
.50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

1149
01:21:30,282 --> 01:21:31,784
This one's set.

1150
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:33,244
Let's go. Go!

1151
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:34,745
All right, move! Let's go!

1152
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:37,957
Come on. Come on!

1153
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:40,751
Ready to go!

1154
01:21:41,794 --> 01:21:43,128
They're all set.

1155
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:12,384
Finish it!

1156
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:28,067
You freak, die!

1157
01:24:17,324 --> 01:24:18,617
Watch out.

1158
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:20,411
Need me to call a doctor?

1159
01:24:20,577 --> 01:24:22,579
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

1160
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:26,375
What the hell you doin' here?

1161
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,751
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

1162
01:24:27,835 --> 01:24:30,546
Nah, Daniels.
Bad cop, RoboCop.

1163
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:35,634
I've recovered 26 guns 
from Vallon's warehouse.

1164
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:38,595
Thirteen serial numbers match
weapons missing from Evidence.

1165
01:24:38,762 --> 01:24:40,597
And I got your prints
all over 'em.

1166
01:24:40,764 --> 01:24:41,765
This is bullshit.

1167
01:24:41,932 --> 01:24:43,726
I also have CCTV footage

1168
01:24:43,809 --> 01:24:45,911
of you and Vallon the same day 
he tried to kill me.

1169
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:48,247
- So put him on the payroll.
- Why we talkin' about this?

1170
01:24:48,313 --> 01:24:51,608
It won't work. Now that his partner
got hit, he's never gonna let it go.

1171
01:24:51,775 --> 01:24:53,193
- What is that?
- Lewis' hospital.

1172
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,820
Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.

1173
01:24:54,987 --> 01:24:57,865
I kill a cop, I'm lookin'
over my shoulder...

1174
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:00,325
You know what they do
to cops in prison, man?

1175
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:03,370
Being locked up with the
same dudes you put in there?

1176
01:25:06,707 --> 01:25:08,417
How long you think
before he gives you up?

1177
01:25:12,171 --> 01:25:14,840
Don't shoot me. Okay?

1178
01:25:15,841 --> 01:25:18,177
I swear to Christ.
It was Dean.

1179
01:25:18,343 --> 01:25:21,221
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1180
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:25,184
Thank you for your cooperation.

1181
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:28,854
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1182
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:39,823
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1183
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:43,243
'Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1184
01:25:43,327 --> 01:25:45,037
Alex, I can explain.

1185
01:25:45,704 --> 01:25:47,080
You tipped him off today.

1186
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:48,415
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

1187
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:50,417
You tried to kill me twice.

1188
01:25:50,501 --> 01:25:53,796
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

1189
01:25:54,087 --> 01:25:55,088
Confess.

1190
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,091
Now, in front of everyone.

1191
01:25:58,217 --> 01:25:59,218
Confess!

1192
01:26:09,061 --> 01:26:10,062
What happened?

1193
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:12,356
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.

1194
01:26:12,523 --> 01:26:13,524
Why?

1195
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:14,942
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1196
01:26:15,025 --> 01:26:16,485
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

1197
01:26:16,568 --> 01:26:19,071
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

1198
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,614
We got anything on her?

1199
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:23,116
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1200
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,077
What do you think?

1201
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:30,207
You know what?

1202
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:34,878
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

1203
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:44,471
Alex, I don't know 
if you can hear me.

1204
01:26:44,763 --> 01:26:48,058
But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers

1205
01:26:48,225 --> 01:26:50,644
inside the Detroit Police Department.

1206
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:55,148
And in so doing, you shed light 
on an invaluable truth.

1207
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:57,234
Even the police,

1208
01:26:57,317 --> 01:27:01,321
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

1209
01:27:02,114 --> 01:27:03,615
they can be bribed.

1210
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:07,119
They can be bought.

1211
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:12,875
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

1212
01:27:13,834 --> 01:27:16,044
Americans could be
living in a country

1213
01:27:16,128 --> 01:27:19,464
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1214
01:27:19,798 --> 01:27:21,300
but incorruptible.

1215
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:24,928
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done.

1216
01:27:25,095 --> 01:27:26,805
And for all that you are.

1217
01:27:27,306 --> 01:27:30,475
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1218
01:27:31,143 --> 01:27:33,896
Our doctors
are working ceaselessly

1219
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:36,732
but, at this time, it is unclear 
if he will survive.

1220
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:40,027
Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt

1221
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:41,987
on Detective
Alex Murphy's life

1222
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,364
will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?

1223
01:27:44,448 --> 01:27:46,325
At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern

1224
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,493
is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.

1225
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,788
How many times
does Detective Murphy

1226
01:27:51,872 --> 01:27:54,291
have to give his life
for his country?

1227
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:59,796
I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow

1228
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,468
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.

1229
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:11,433
Senator Dreyfus is my friend.

1230
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:14,311
He has been
my mentor and my strength

1231
01:28:14,394 --> 01:28:16,855
in times of difficulty
on this floor.

1232
01:28:17,356 --> 01:28:20,442
But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,

1233
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:23,654
and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.

1234
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:25,072
So I vote yes.

1235
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:27,532
The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.

1236
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:30,035
That's us ahead,
39 to 10.

1237
01:28:30,202 --> 01:28:33,121
I spoke to the Senate liaison and
it looks like it's in the bag,

1238
01:28:33,205 --> 01:28:36,291
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1239
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:40,128
We're here live
at DPD headquarters

1240
01:28:40,212 --> 01:28:42,965
where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.

1241
01:28:43,048 --> 01:28:44,257
What the hell?

1242
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:49,388
Omnicorp has denied me and my son 
access to Alex for weeks.

1243
01:28:50,055 --> 01:28:51,890
I demand to know why.

1244
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:57,896
This treatment is inhuman and somebody
needs to be held accountable.

1245
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:00,899
Oh, we're fucked.

1246
01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:02,442
No, we only need 12 votes.

1247
01:29:02,526 --> 01:29:04,027
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1248
01:29:04,194 --> 01:29:06,405
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1249
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:08,323
I mean, those two should
not be allowed contact.

1250
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:10,826
If she starts
putting ideas in his head...

1251
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:13,620
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.

1252
01:29:13,787 --> 01:29:15,247
And what about Alex?

1253
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:17,582
You know, unfortunately,
we can'tjust keep him on ice.

1254
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,794
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1255
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:23,380
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

1256
01:29:23,547 --> 01:29:26,967
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1257
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:30,345
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

1258
01:29:30,429 --> 01:29:32,806
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

1259
01:29:32,889 --> 01:29:34,850
It's property of Omnicorp.

1260
01:29:34,933 --> 01:29:37,185
And politics are
the least of your concern.

1261
01:29:37,269 --> 01:29:38,937
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1262
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:41,481
How long till it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?

1263
01:29:41,565 --> 01:29:42,691
If that happens,

1264
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:45,694
every journalist in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1265
01:29:45,777 --> 01:29:47,738
I mean, we created a hero.

1266
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,949
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1267
01:29:54,453 --> 01:29:56,163
What's bigger than a hero?

1268
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:09,134
Dead hero.

1269
01:30:13,472 --> 01:30:15,432
Get me Dr. Norton.

1270
01:30:24,483 --> 01:30:25,609
What is this, Raymond?

1271
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:30,739
You have Mattox spying on me and now 
this bullshit about a "critical condition"?

1272
01:30:30,906 --> 01:30:33,617
You know and I know
Alex is fine!

1273
01:30:33,784 --> 01:30:34,951
Calm down.

1274
01:30:35,118 --> 01:30:36,620
Bennett.

1275
01:30:36,787 --> 01:30:37,954
Your work is so good,
I don't...

1276
01:30:38,038 --> 01:30:39,372
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1277
01:30:39,456 --> 01:30:41,374
You saw the woman on TV!

1278
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:43,668
This has to stop!

1279
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:46,797
You're right.

1280
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:49,508
But let me ask you something, 
Dennett.

1281
01:30:49,674 --> 01:30:52,094
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1282
01:30:52,177 --> 01:30:55,722
He's never gonna be a normal man, 
a father, a husband.

1283
01:30:55,806 --> 01:30:59,059
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...

1284
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:00,310
Bennett.

1285
01:31:02,187 --> 01:31:03,688
Let's face it.

1286
01:31:04,523 --> 01:31:06,024
We failed him.

1287
01:31:07,484 --> 01:31:09,402
We failed Alex Murphy.

1288
01:31:09,486 --> 01:31:11,113
But I want you to think about 
the bigger picture

1289
01:31:11,196 --> 01:31:12,797
because that's what
we're talking about.

1290
01:31:12,823 --> 01:31:15,575
The work you've done with him is
gonna be studied for decades.

1291
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,869
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1292
01:31:17,953 --> 01:31:22,249
No policeman is ever going to die 
in the line of duty again

1293
01:31:22,999 --> 01:31:24,543
because of you.

1294
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:27,671
You think about that.

1295
01:31:36,179 --> 01:31:40,142
I want that family
taken care of

1296
01:31:40,225 --> 01:31:41,726
beyond their wildest dreams.

1297
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:43,854
- We owe them that.
- I agree.

1298
01:31:44,604 --> 01:31:47,941
I want full funding.
Ten years.

1299
01:31:48,358 --> 01:31:50,026
New staff, all my own people.

1300
01:31:50,193 --> 01:31:51,736
Fantastic.

1301
01:31:52,445 --> 01:31:53,446
Deal.

1302
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:05,333
Hey. What's going on?

1303
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:07,502
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

1304
01:32:07,586 --> 01:32:09,337
They're not waking him up.

1305
01:32:09,421 --> 01:32:11,298
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1306
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:13,124
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1307
01:32:14,718 --> 01:32:16,136
The voting period has ended.

1308
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:18,805
The clerks have
tabulated the results.

1309
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:20,932
The yeas are 63.

1310
01:32:21,016 --> 01:32:23,727
The nays are 22.

1311
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,313
A majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.

1312
01:32:26,396 --> 01:32:30,150
The Dreyfus Act has been
repealed by Congress.

1313
01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:38,200
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1314
01:32:38,283 --> 01:32:39,367
This is Mattox.

1315
01:32:39,451 --> 01:32:40,827
Dennett's on board.

1316
01:32:40,911 --> 01:32:42,495
It's about time.

1317
01:32:47,584 --> 01:32:48,710
Call it.

1318
01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:50,879
Get it done.

1319
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,298
My pleasure.

1320
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:04,226
Mrs. Murphy... You can come here 
as much as you want.

1321
01:33:04,309 --> 01:33:07,562
You can threaten me. You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1322
01:33:07,646 --> 01:33:10,565
But I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

1323
01:33:10,857 --> 01:33:13,610
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1324
01:33:15,153 --> 01:33:16,655
Is Alex okay?

1325
01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:20,367
He has important information to share
with you. Will you accompany me?

1326
01:33:22,702 --> 01:33:23,870
David.

1327
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,832
We gotta go.
Can you grab your coat?

1328
01:33:29,167 --> 01:33:30,168
Hey!

1329
01:33:30,252 --> 01:33:31,294
I'm in the elevator, 
on my way down.

1330
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:32,921
I need access to the lab.

1331
01:33:33,004 --> 01:33:34,631
That's insane.
They're still here.

1332
01:33:34,714 --> 01:33:36,424
Distract them.

1333
01:33:36,508 --> 01:33:37,634
Okay.

1334
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:39,886
I cannot...

1335
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:42,138
There's a lady in here going hysterical.

1336
01:33:42,222 --> 01:33:44,099
She will not let us in. 
She's got the codes for the door.

1337
01:33:44,182 --> 01:33:45,850
I repeat,
she will not let us in.

1338
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:48,228
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

1339
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:49,813
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1340
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:52,832
Do you wanna be responsible for the
deaths of everyone in this building?

1341
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,401
Hey! Stop!

1342
01:33:58,571 --> 01:33:59,698
Don't shoot!

1343
01:33:59,781 --> 01:34:01,157
Step outside.

1344
01:34:07,622 --> 01:34:09,291
Unlock the transmitter!

1345
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:11,668
Transmitter unlocked!

1346
01:34:19,134 --> 01:34:21,011
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1347
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,554
Right away, sir.

1348
01:34:24,723 --> 01:34:25,974
Wake him up!

1349
01:34:26,391 --> 01:34:29,477
Alex! Alex!

1350
01:34:29,894 --> 01:34:33,064
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

1351
01:34:33,148 --> 01:34:34,357
Alex, can you hear me?

1352
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,652
These men are here
to kill us.

1353
01:34:37,736 --> 01:34:40,196
They're here to kill us,
for chrissakes!

1354
01:34:45,076 --> 01:34:46,786
Mrs. Murphy, last night,

1355
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,872
Alex had a psychotic break.

1356
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:53,251
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

1357
01:34:54,377 --> 01:34:55,879
We did everything,

1358
01:34:55,962 --> 01:34:58,882
everything, we could, but 
the doctors couldn't save him.

1359
01:35:00,342 --> 01:35:02,385
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1360
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:05,221
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1361
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,141
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

1362
01:35:08,767 --> 01:35:10,435
Mattox shut you down.

1363
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:14,647
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

1364
01:35:15,065 --> 01:35:17,233
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1365
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:20,403
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1366
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:24,366
He wants you dead, Alex.
Do you understand?

1367
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:26,368
Sorry. If there's
anything we can do

1368
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:27,786
for you and David,
we'll do it.

1369
01:35:27,952 --> 01:35:30,080
I want nothing from you.

1370
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:32,332
I understand.

1371
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:35,210
You stay out of our lives.

1372
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:37,837
You and your company.

1373
01:35:38,129 --> 01:35:40,006
If that's what
you think is best.

1374
01:35:40,965 --> 01:35:42,425
There's one more thing.

1375
01:35:42,509 --> 01:35:45,345
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David

1376
01:35:45,428 --> 01:35:47,639
if we kept
this matter private.

1377
01:35:47,889 --> 01:35:50,433
We don't wanna
damage Alex's legacy.

1378
01:35:53,103 --> 01:35:54,938
Alex! Alex!

1379
01:35:55,313 --> 01:35:56,940
I can fix this!

1380
01:35:57,023 --> 01:35:58,483
You lied to me.

1381
01:35:58,566 --> 01:35:59,818
You lied to my wife.

1382
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,528
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1383
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:02,862
You want me
to trust you, Doctor?

1384
01:36:02,946 --> 01:36:04,989
Alex, I can go to the press!

1385
01:36:06,408 --> 01:36:08,993
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1386
01:36:09,285 --> 01:36:10,745
Alex!

1387
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:13,206
Listen to me, please!

1388
01:36:14,207 --> 01:36:17,502
Alex! Alex!

1389
01:36:29,139 --> 01:36:30,181
What the hell?

1390
01:36:38,565 --> 01:36:39,941
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1391
01:36:40,024 --> 01:36:42,110
and for chrissakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1392
01:36:42,193 --> 01:36:43,194
Roger that.

1393
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:45,238
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1394
01:36:46,573 --> 01:36:48,158
Look at this city.

1395
01:36:49,993 --> 01:36:51,536
So beautiful.

1396
01:36:52,537 --> 01:36:55,206
It's become so peaceful.

1397
01:36:58,001 --> 01:36:59,335
I wish

1398
01:37:00,336 --> 01:37:02,589
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1399
01:37:03,089 --> 01:37:04,841
I have very sad news.

1400
01:37:05,008 --> 01:37:07,677
Despite our best efforts
to save him,

1401
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:10,430
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1402
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:12,140
Alex Murphy was...

1403
01:37:12,223 --> 01:37:13,433
Mr. Sellars.

1404
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,435
- What is it?
- Mattox just called.

1405
01:37:16,019 --> 01:37:17,854
We need you to come with us now.

1406
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:25,945
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1407
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:28,072
What are you talking about? 
We have a security situation here.

1408
01:37:28,156 --> 01:37:29,574
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1409
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:31,534
Sir, there's a car outside
that's supposed to...

1410
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:33,244
That area is locked down.
Now go.

1411
01:37:33,328 --> 01:37:34,996
- What's happening?
- I said go!

1412
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,332
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

1413
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:41,336
Mr. Sellars.

1414
01:37:41,503 --> 01:37:43,763
- How close is that helicopter?
- About 10 minutes, sir.

1415
01:38:01,314 --> 01:38:02,565
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1416
01:38:02,732 --> 01:38:05,068
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1417
01:38:05,235 --> 01:38:06,444
It's an emergency.

1418
01:38:06,611 --> 01:38:08,238
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

1419
01:38:08,696 --> 01:38:10,406
Apparently there's a Clara Murphy 
in the lobby.

1420
01:38:10,573 --> 01:38:13,910
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

1421
01:38:14,077 --> 01:38:16,412
- What do you wanna do?
- Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1422
01:38:16,579 --> 01:38:17,664
Yes, sir.

1423
01:38:21,584 --> 01:38:24,379
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

1424
01:38:24,546 --> 01:38:26,589
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1425
01:38:26,756 --> 01:38:29,384
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed. Clear?

1426
01:38:29,467 --> 01:38:30,468
Clear.
Clear.

1427
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:48,236
Hold it right there.

1428
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:50,238
Don't move.

1429
01:38:53,992 --> 01:38:57,328
This is private property. 
You are not authorized to be here!

1430
01:39:01,249 --> 01:39:03,585
I'd put those guns down now
if I were you.

1431
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,620
- Stand down.
- All right, man, we're good.

1432
01:39:51,883 --> 01:39:53,217
Head to the lower level.

1433
01:39:54,844 --> 01:39:55,845
Hold up, hold up!

1434
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,180
Ram it!

1435
01:40:57,448 --> 01:40:58,741
Gun it.

1436
01:41:00,201 --> 01:41:01,786
Go, go, go! Now!

1437
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,262
Alex, run!

1438
01:41:20,096 --> 01:41:22,140
Omnicorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

1439
01:41:22,306 --> 01:41:24,225
Drop your weapon.

1440
01:41:24,392 --> 01:41:27,186
Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.

1441
01:41:42,452 --> 01:41:43,578
What's going on?

1442
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:45,913
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

1443
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,583
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

1444
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:50,793
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1445
01:41:50,877 --> 01:41:51,961
and he's shooting up
the building.

1446
01:41:52,044 --> 01:41:54,839
So we've gotta get you and 
your son out of here right away.

1447
01:41:55,006 --> 01:41:56,549
I gotta take this call.

1448
01:41:57,842 --> 01:41:59,427
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

1449
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:01,053
Roger that, sir.

1450
01:42:01,471 --> 01:42:04,515
- Don't shoot. My robot. You just flank.
- Got it.

1451
01:42:04,682 --> 01:42:05,933
Tin Man.

1452
01:42:08,686 --> 01:42:09,896
Tin Man.

1453
01:42:10,938 --> 01:42:12,190
Tin Man.

1454
01:42:12,774 --> 01:42:13,941
Oh, there it is.

1455
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:15,985
You look like crap.

1456
01:42:18,613 --> 01:42:19,781
What's the matter?

1457
01:42:19,947 --> 01:42:21,157
Can't shoot?

1458
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,035
Huh?

1459
01:42:24,786 --> 01:42:26,871
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1460
01:42:26,954 --> 01:42:27,955
You're a robot.

1461
01:42:28,164 --> 01:42:30,374
I'm a red asset.
Wrote that myself.

1462
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:32,126
What do you think?

1463
01:42:32,543 --> 01:42:35,379
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1464
01:42:35,546 --> 01:42:36,547
Pull it.

1465
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,424
You can run.

1466
01:42:38,966 --> 01:42:39,967
Go on.

1467
01:42:40,218 --> 01:42:41,344
Run.

1468
01:42:41,803 --> 01:42:42,929
Run!

1469
01:42:43,262 --> 01:42:45,097
There you go. Run.

1470
01:42:45,556 --> 01:42:46,891
Run. Run!

1471
01:42:50,061 --> 01:42:51,479
Whoo!

1472
01:42:51,562 --> 01:42:53,689
Stings like a bitch,
don't it?

1473
01:42:53,856 --> 01:42:57,151
Aren't you lucky I didn't have 
my gun set to "kill"?

1474
01:42:58,402 --> 01:42:59,737
Hey, listen.

1475
01:43:00,196 --> 01:43:01,781
This isn't personal.

1476
01:43:02,824 --> 01:43:04,575
Well, maybe a little.

1477
01:43:06,327 --> 01:43:08,162
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1478
01:43:19,882 --> 01:43:21,342
Helicopter's approaching.

1479
01:43:21,425 --> 01:43:22,677
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1480
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,721
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you
and your son can get on first.

1481
01:43:31,143 --> 01:43:32,436
Officer down.

1482
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,646
Mechanical room.

1483
01:43:33,729 --> 01:43:35,314
Omnicorp Building.

1484
01:43:35,481 --> 01:43:37,358
Roger that. EMS on the way.

1485
01:43:38,985 --> 01:43:40,570
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1486
01:43:40,653 --> 01:43:41,904
It's nonfatal.

1487
01:43:41,988 --> 01:43:43,573
Go. Go.

1488
01:43:44,782 --> 01:43:47,577
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

1489
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:55,334
What's that?

1490
01:43:57,253 --> 01:43:58,379
- He's got a gun!
- What?

1491
01:43:58,546 --> 01:43:59,547
Pull up! Pull up!

1492
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:06,804
- What the hell is he doing?
- Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1493
01:44:12,351 --> 01:44:13,352
Alex?

1494
01:44:13,519 --> 01:44:14,520
Dad?

1495
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:19,358
Clara, David.

1496
01:44:20,359 --> 01:44:21,527
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1497
01:44:21,611 --> 01:44:22,612
Wait.

1498
01:44:23,696 --> 01:44:25,573
- Get out of the way.
- Alex, put down the gun.

1499
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,825
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1500
01:44:29,702 --> 01:44:31,078
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1501
01:44:31,162 --> 01:44:33,014
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1502
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:39,128
Are you here to cuff me?
All right.

1503
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:41,380
Go 'head, cuff me.

1504
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:45,176
You can't. You're not
programmed that way.

1505
01:44:45,259 --> 01:44:46,761
If you go against
the program,

1506
01:44:46,844 --> 01:44:48,679
the entire system
shuts down, so.

1507
01:44:48,846 --> 01:44:50,932
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1508
01:44:51,098 --> 01:44:53,184
Get down on the ground and 
put your hands behind your back.

1509
01:44:53,351 --> 01:44:54,352
I'm just from marketing.

1510
01:44:54,518 --> 01:44:56,854
- Now! 
- Okay, yep, yep, yep. Yep.

1511
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:59,190
Alex, we need to work 
together here.

1512
01:44:59,357 --> 01:45:02,443
Because I'm the only one with 
the technology to keep you alive.

1513
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:05,196
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1514
01:45:11,327 --> 01:45:12,328
All right.

1515
01:45:12,495 --> 01:45:13,496
Weapon.

1516
01:45:15,164 --> 01:45:18,292
Alex, honestly,
I mean you no harm.

1517
01:45:18,459 --> 01:45:20,753
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.

1518
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,797
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1519
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,715
Sellars, please! Don't!

1520
01:45:24,882 --> 01:45:27,526
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family

1521
01:45:28,761 --> 01:45:30,346
and I could just
kill them too.

1522
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:32,139
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it

1523
01:45:32,223 --> 01:45:34,225
because, let's face it,

1524
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,185
you're a robot.

1525
01:45:36,811 --> 01:45:38,270
Do you understand that?

1526
01:45:42,525 --> 01:45:43,526
Alex.

1527
01:45:46,696 --> 01:45:47,947
Dad!

1528
01:45:52,076 --> 01:45:53,327
Baby.

1529
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:00,001
Hey.

1530
01:46:01,627 --> 01:46:02,628
Hey.

1531
01:46:03,129 --> 01:46:05,131
Everything's gonna be all right.

1532
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:08,342
Everything's gonna be all right.

1533
01:46:58,225 --> 01:46:59,977
How you feeling, Alex?

1534
01:47:01,896 --> 01:47:03,022
I'm ready.

1535
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,186
He's ready.

1536
01:48:16,303 --> 01:48:17,471
There's still no word

1537
01:48:17,555 --> 01:48:20,558
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

1538
01:48:21,475 --> 01:48:25,229
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1539
01:48:25,312 --> 01:48:28,023
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

1540
01:48:28,107 --> 01:48:32,653
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by cell phone

1541
01:48:32,736 --> 01:48:35,156
that shows
the people of Detroit

1542
01:48:35,239 --> 01:48:37,324
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

1543
01:48:37,408 --> 01:48:38,993
sooner than they think.

1544
01:48:41,036 --> 01:48:42,538
The real tragedy here

1545
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:47,418
is that our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1546
01:48:48,794 --> 01:48:53,549
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

1547
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:57,094
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

1548
01:48:57,178 --> 01:49:00,931
I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.

1549
01:49:01,932 --> 01:49:04,852
But I do believe
my research program is sound.

1550
01:49:06,437 --> 01:49:07,688
What I did with it

1551
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:10,232
was wrong.

1552
01:49:10,316 --> 01:49:13,319
The fact that this
mother...

1553
01:49:13,402 --> 01:49:16,655
is not serving time
in some federal penitentiary

1554
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:20,743
is a huge, hot, heaping
pile of horse...

1555
01:49:26,498 --> 01:49:30,878
Now I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous

1556
01:49:30,961 --> 01:49:34,965
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1557
01:49:35,132 --> 01:49:39,261
Some of you even believe that 
the use of these drones overseas

1558
01:49:39,345 --> 01:49:44,016
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists

1559
01:49:44,099 --> 01:49:46,852
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1560
01:49:47,311 --> 01:49:49,772
To you, I say...

1561
01:49:49,939 --> 01:49:52,316
Stop whining!

1562
01:49:54,151 --> 01:49:56,779
America is now

1563
01:49:56,862 --> 01:49:59,156
and always will be

1564
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:03,661
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1565
01:50:08,207 --> 01:50:09,750
I'm Pat Novak.

1566
01:50:11,252 --> 01:50:12,503
Good night.

1567
01:50:14,028 --> 01:50:17,028
