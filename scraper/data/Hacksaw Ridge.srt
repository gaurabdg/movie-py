00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,722
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

2
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,806
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i>

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,682
<i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i>

4
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,650
<i>and His understanding no one can fathom.</i>

5
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,609
<i>He gives strength to the weary
and increases the power of the weak.</i>

6
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,370
<i>Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall.</i>

7
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,684
<i>But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.</i>

8
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,766
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

9
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,650
<i>They will run and not grow weary.</i>

10
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,485
<i>They will walk and not be faint.</i>

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,250
Desmond, hang on!

12
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,761
Hang on, Desmond!

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,889
We're going to get you out of here!

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,722
Desmond. Desmond!

15
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,361
What?

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,444
- Wait up.
- Catch up.

17
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,887
Wait up, I've got something to tell you.

18
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,766
What, Hal?

19
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,285
Race you to the top.

20
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,964
Hey! Cheater!

21
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,009
- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!

22
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,280
- Want a hand?
- I got it.

23
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,805
- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!

24
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,291
- Quit it.
- You quit it.

25
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,243
For Pete's sake.

26
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,608
Hey! Get away from that
ledge, you damn fool kids!

27
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,336
You're going to break your necks!

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,360
It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.

29
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,727
They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...

30
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,403
Putting in a sidewalk...

31
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,482
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,961
Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

33
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,848
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

34
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,362
It's like I died with you.

35
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,691
It's like we boys never existed.

36
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,051
Well, that's all I got for you today.

37
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,244
Block him with your right, Desmond.

38
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,523
Stop it! Do you hear me?

39
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,331
- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?

40
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,402
Tom! Ugh!

41
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,562
Why stop 'em?
Saves me whipping them both.

42
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,483
This way, I just whip the one that wins.

43
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,041
Tom!

44
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,246
No!

45
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,731
Oh, God.

46
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,408
Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?

47
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,606
What the hell have you done?

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,881
He can't hear me.

49
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,928
I'll get some ice.

50
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,490
- You shift that basket.
- I got it.

51
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,964
Is he breathing?

52
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,091
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?

53
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,489
Hal, can you hear me?

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,006
Hal... Come on.

55
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,730
He's dilated.

56
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,526
Hal...

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,801
What do you think you're doin'?

58
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,966
I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.

59
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,521
You hear me, Desmond?

60
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,126
- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.

61
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,043
What's that gonna teach the boy?

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,566
He's violent enough already.

63
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,086
Okay, fine,
you go smother him in kisses.

64
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,721
You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.

65
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,683
Hal's gonna be okay.

66
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Hey.

67
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,763
- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.

68
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,650
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

69
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,210
And to take another man's life,

70
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,001
that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.

71
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,926
Nothing hurts his heart so much.

72
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,416
Don't you understand English?

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,809
Do I have to tell you again?

74
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,928
You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,896
What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,336
You mind
your own damned business!

77
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,522
Go sleep it off, Tom.

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,891
I hate him.

79
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,491
Momma?

80
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,961
Oh.

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,282
Why does he hate us so much?

82
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,166
Oh, he don't hate us.

83
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,682
He hates himself sometimes.

84
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,965
Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.

85
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,210
I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.

86
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,691
<i>♪ Praise the Lord</i>

87
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,128
<i>♪ Praise the Lord</i>

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,488
<i>♪ Let the people rejoice!</i>

89
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,688

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,209

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,887
<i>♪ And give him the glory</i>

92
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,887
<i>♪ Great things he has done ♪</i>

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,610
How'd we sound, Desmond?

94
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,967
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

95
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,726
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.

96
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,406
Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.

97
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,007
What's going on out there? Desmond!

98
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,128
Get it up, get it up!

99
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,523
Drag him out. Just the tarp.

100
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll phone an ambulance.

101
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,408
No, no time. Joshua's pickup.

102
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,845
- Quick!
- Okay.

103
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,731
You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.

104
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,325
You're in good hands.

105
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,491
What have we got here?

106
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
It's a severed artery.
Get some sutures.

107
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,207
Yes, doctor.

108
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,176
Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?

109
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,326
- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.

110
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,890
You might have saved this boy's life.

111
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,011
You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.

112
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,684
What's your name, son?

113
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,762
Gilbert.

114
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,803
- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.

115
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,848
Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.

116
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,207
You feel pain?

117
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,123
Stay with us, okay?

118
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,566
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.

119
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,286
Are you all right?

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,848
Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.

121
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,446
What do you need?

122
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,129
My belt.

123
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,690
I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.

124
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,808
My pants don't hold up
so good without it.

125
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,931
Well, uh, I don't have your belt.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,570
No, I know that, ma'am.
It's out there.

127
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,136
It's right out there
with the boy still.

128
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,848
Okay. I'm just here to take blood.

129
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,685
I'll give mine.

130
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,843
Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.

131
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,331
I'll call you.

132
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,889
That room.

133
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,882
You ever given blood before, Mr...

134
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,166
Doss.

135
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,966
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.

136
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,445
I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.

137
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,320
You may be a little dizzy
when we're done.

138
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,926
Is somebody picking you up?

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,207
No, ma'am. Walking back.

140
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,089
Where do you live?

141
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,491
Fort Hill, ma'am.

142
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,170
That's a ways.

143
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,564
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.

144
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,642
It's seven that way!

145
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,007
You must really like the woods.

146
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,082
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

147
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,128
Okay, put some pressure here.

148
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,928
- You okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,121
Bye.

150
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,809
Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?

151
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,770
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.

152
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,416
Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,363
Goodness. Does she know that?

154
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,363
Well, not yet. She's about to.

155
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,570
You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.

156
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,081
Spoke to her.

157
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,367
Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.

158
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,805
- Hal!
- Come here.

159
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,609
Keep your greasy paws off of me.

160
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,246
Wish me luck, Momma.

161
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,201
Good luck.

162
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,645
Next.

163
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,883
Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?

164
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,007
Yes, ma'am. I have.

165
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,923
You're the belt man.

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,525
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

167
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,410
Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood two days in a row.

168
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,448
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.

169
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,887
- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.

170
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,080
Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.

171
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,202
Well, you got to.

172
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,776
Ever since you stuck me
with that needle,

173
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,962
my heart's been beating real fast.

174
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,327
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.

175
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,444
I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.

176
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,562
It is?

177
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,928
That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,047
No good?

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,164
I didn't say that.

180
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,884
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?

181
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,369
- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,165
Arteries spurt blood.

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,650
And veins?

184
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,047
Bleed.

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
I think you need to practice

186
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,444
your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.

187
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,363
Yeah, I probably do.

188
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,162
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.

189
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,046
On dating?

190
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,088
On blood.

191
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,245
Another medical question perhaps?

192
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,642
No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

193
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,282
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

194
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,365
No, you're just beautiful.

195
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,924
Out of the way!

196
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,808
You need to watch where you're going.

197
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,404
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.

198
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,641
You didn't ask.

199
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,641
- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,447
You coming?

201
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
Watch where you're walking!

202
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,090
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

203
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,136
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,

204
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,403
- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?

205
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,450
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.

206
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,329
Loads of boys
from our church are going.

207
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,449
- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.

208
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,920
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.

209
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,049
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,690
Nice uniform, good hat.

211
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,290
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.

212
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,004
- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.

213
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,167
What?

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,369
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.

215
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,125
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.

216
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,170
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

217
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,969
I just hope that
when our Hal gets shot,

218
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,566
it's through the front of his jacket.

219
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,769
Like a simple entry wound,
not much mess.

220
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,650
Artie got hit in the back,

221
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,282
it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.

222
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,767
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

223
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,165
It was lucky he was dead,

224
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,608
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.

225
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,890
Get outta of my sight.

226
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,969
What are you, part mountain goat?

227
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,527
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

228
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,443
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?

229
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,525
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,681
What?

231
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,241
A kiss.

232
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,644
- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,688
But that is still my condition.

234
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,365
That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.

235
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,329
Well, hold on now.

236
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,563
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

237
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,007
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.

238
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,364
Kiss me and find out.

239
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,401
What?

240
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,609
I have to enlist.

241
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,406
I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.

242
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,324
- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,084
I want to be a medic.

244
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,367
I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.

245
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,687
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.

246
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,321
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!

247
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,762
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?

248
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,200
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?

249
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,403
Well, I wouldn't know,
you haven't asked.

250
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,122
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.

251
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,250
- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.

252
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,411
When?

253
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,925
Soon as you get your first leave.

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,162
But I still don't like you
at this moment.

255
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,289
- Yeah.
- Okay.

256
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,806
Okay. Well, I love you.

257
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,008
Shh!

258
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,560
Momma said come see you here.

259
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,721
Yeah.

260
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,087
These three were my best friends.

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,920
I grew up with 'em,

262
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.

263
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,240
And I enlisted with 'em.

264
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,808
Now my friends are there,

265
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,563
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.

266
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,403
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.

267
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,486
Daddy, I signed up already.

268
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,923
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,684
You ain't everybody else!

270
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,924
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,766
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

272
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,571
And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!

273
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,244
You can't!

274
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,606
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.

275
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,650
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.

276
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,802
You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.

277
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,882
No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

278
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,931
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.

279
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,890
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,370
What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?

281
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,727
Well, I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,484
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

283
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,360
You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,

284
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,603
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.

285
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,684
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,

286
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,525
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

287
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,400
- Ready?
- Ready.

288
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,536
Y'all need some air.

289
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,576
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.

290
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,002
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

291
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,487
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

292
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,370
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?

293
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,129
I want you to have this.
It's mine.

294
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,562
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

295
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,008
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,644
I love you.

297
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,128
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

298
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,770
- What else...
- Hey. Oh.

299
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,161
Hey. Sorry, pal.

300
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,208
...means you're the person.

301
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,607
- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.

302
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,650
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?

303
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,371
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

304
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,568
You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.

305
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,087
Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.

306
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,366
Randall Fuller.

307
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,409
Desmond Doss.

308
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,450
Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.

309
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,329
That's because
no one else here can read.

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,643
The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."

311
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,166
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.

312
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
You know testicles.

313
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,921
Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.

314
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,209
Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?

315
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,970
- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?

316
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,806
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.

317
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,846
Whoa!

318
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,082
That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.

319
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,616
Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.

320
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,165
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

321
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,208
Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

322
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,250
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?

323
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,560
Desmond Doss.

324
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,924
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,721
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

326
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,086
- Hey.
- How you doing?

327
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,764
- Desmond.
- Yeah.

328
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,604
This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.

329
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,681
Hey.

330
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,684
That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.

331
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,171
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

332
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,402
Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.

333
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,205
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

334
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,931
I think Lucky's got a good book.

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,162
- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.

336
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,762
Attention!

337
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,650
Line up! Move it!

338
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,087
Let's go, move it. Move it.

339
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,888
You are a very
strange-looking individual

340
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,769
if you don't mind me
saying so, Private.

341
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,047
- Name?
- Andy Walker.

342
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,804
How long have you been dead, son?

343
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,282
- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!

344
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,241
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.

345
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,403
- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!

346
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,767
- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!

347
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,045
There's something off
in your presentation, Private.

348
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,969
Can't place it.

349
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,165
Is it your hair?

350
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,801
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

351
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.

352
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,041
Oh, yes, of course, that's it.
The knife.

353
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,963
- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

354
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,761
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

355
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,776
- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?

356
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,536
It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.

357
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,769
I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.

358
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,684
Who threw the knife?

359
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,003
I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

360
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,801
You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?

361
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,211
No, I'm Polish.

362
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,489
Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

363
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,289
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,

364
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,045
- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!

365
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,043
Let me see your Indian war cry, son.

366
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,296
I don't...

367
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,048
Louder! Let me see it.

368
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,924
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?

369
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,445
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?

370
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,000
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?

371
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,321
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?

372
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,051
- No, Sergeant!
- Good.

373
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,282
Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"

374
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,601
as a sign of great respect
to your people.

375
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,121
Thank you, Sergeant!

376
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,416
Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?

377
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,441
No, Sergeant.

378
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,727
- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.

379
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,406
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.

380
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,881
Makes me want to pull
an ear off, Private.

381
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,008
- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!

382
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,242
Should be easy for you, then.

383
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,526
- Corporal.
- Sergeant.

384
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,841
Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.

385
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,001
Yes, Sergeant.

386
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,244
- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.

387
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,607
Raise your foot. Higher.

388
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,170
Everyone outside. Now! Move it.

389
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,206
I said move it.

390
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,776
All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.

391
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,406
- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.

392
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,927
I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state

393
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,321
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.

394
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,449
Now move your privates, Private Parts!

395
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,525
Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!

396
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,848
I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,

397
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,089
so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,

398
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,288
so I may then kick them!

399
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,443
Create a loop.
This is the rabbit hole.

400
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,161
The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,

401
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,882
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!

402
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,644
Very good, Tex.

403
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,486
Keep struggling, Teach.

404
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,085
Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?

405
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,086
No, Sarge.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,844
Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?

407
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,680
- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.

408
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,690
You know if you don't breathe,
you'll die.

409
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,128
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.

410
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,331
Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!

411
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,166
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.

412
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,846
You strangled yourself, numb nuts!

413
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,684
- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.

414
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,923
A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.

415
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,330
What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?

416
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,081
You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!

417
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,131
- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.

418
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,809
Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!

419
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,531
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.

420
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,011
Show me something!

421
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,336
Run like you mean it!

422
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,176
- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,726
Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!

424
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,923
Move! Move! Move!

425
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,082
I want to see you work. Let's go!

426
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,810
Dig, dig, dig!

427
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,360
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

428
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,126
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.

429
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,409
Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!

430
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,602
Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!

431
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,650
Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!

432
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,131
Drive!

433
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,565
Drive!

434
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,926
Jeez, are you okay?

435
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,929
Yeah, I'm fine.

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,647
- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!

437
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,644
What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!

438
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,042
Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!

439
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,929
Hustle! Hustle!

440
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,207
Get your asses across that line!

441
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,051
Time! Nice work, Doss!

442
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,688
This is a personal gift
from the United States government

443
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,444
to each and every one of you.

444
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,082
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber .30, M1,

445
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,409
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon

446
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,201
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.

447
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,081
This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.

448
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,131
Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.

449
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,090
Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.

450
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,522
Don't point your gun forward.

451
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,722
I do not want to be shot today.

452
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,087
No matter how much you are tempted.

453
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,083
Place the weapon by your side.

454
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,531
Pay attention.

455
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,765
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

456
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,686
Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?

457
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,250
No, Sarge.

458
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,247
I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.

459
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,244
Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

460
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,690
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

461
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,363
I can't touch a gun.

462
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,685
What exactly is the problem?

463
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,888
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

464
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,008
I told the Army when I joined up.

465
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,684
That's not possible.

466
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,967
Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?

467
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,451
No, sir.

468
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,171
Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

469
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,450
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.

470
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,603
I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.

471
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,409
He's a C.O., sir.

472
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,166
You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?

473
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,529
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

474
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,531
- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.

475
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,410
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,

476
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,528
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

477
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,685
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.

478
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,521
- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.

479
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,251
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?

480
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,367
Yes, sir.

481
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,408
I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.

482
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,723
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

483
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,122
Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?

484
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,016
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure

485
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,736
that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?

486
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,604
He doesn't want to work
on Saturdays, sir.

487
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,963
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

488
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,046
So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.

489
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,566
I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?

490
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,246
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,

491
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,089
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

492
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,891
All right. Now we got that clear.

493
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,283
Now let me tell you my requirements.

494
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,570
They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.

495
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,610
As long as you're in this company,
under my command,

496
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,728
you will obey my orders. Period.

497
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,401
If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

498
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,769
I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

499
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,001
Dismissed.

500
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,803
Gentlemen!

501
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,645
I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.

502
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,884
Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

503
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,849
He does not practice violence.

504
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,163
He will not even deign
to touch a weapon.

505
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,802
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

506
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,808
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

507
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,324
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

508
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,802
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

509
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,527
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

510
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,841
It is what we men fight for.

511
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,801
To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

512
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,887
Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

513
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,486
So I will expect everyone
in this company

514
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,849
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

515
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,890
for the short time he will be with us.

516
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,525
Am I clear?

517
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,090
Yes, Sergeant.

518
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,851
What'cha got there, Dessie?

519
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,006
You know what that is.

520
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,208
It just seems kind of small.

521
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,930
It's half the Bible for half the man.

522
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,656
For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.

523
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,330
I don't remember speaking to you.

524
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,848
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?

525
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,607
No.

526
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,886
What if you was attacked?

527
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,085
Whoa!

528
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,121
Say, like that.

529
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,965
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?

530
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,729
See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.

531
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,566
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.

532
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,685
Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?

533
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,804
Go on, take a poke.

534
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,320
Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.

535
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,887
Right there.

536
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,091
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

537
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,616
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.

538
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,687
No?

539
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,244
Chickenshit.

540
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,647
Oh.

541
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,806
Hold on here. What is this?

542
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,251
Give me that.

543
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,163
- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.

544
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,810
Hey, pass it around.

545
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,930
Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.

546
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,327
Give me that back.

547
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,561
Please.

548
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,164
Please.

549
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,641
"Please give it back, Smitty."

550
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,688
Please give it back, Smitty.

551
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,448
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

552
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,129
No, sir.

553
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,841
But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?

554
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,649
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

555
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,442
Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?

556
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,330
I'm different. I know that, but...

557
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,402
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

558
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,444
- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.

559
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,560
You lonely?

560
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,085
- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.

561
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,446
I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,

562
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,364
like the one we're pretending
to have right now.

563
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,283
- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.

564
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,560
I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

565
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,084
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.

566
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,131
Well, I'm trying to
understand, all right?

567
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,171
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

568
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,369
God says not to kill.

569
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,280
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

570
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,881
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

571
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,328
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

572
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,883
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

573
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,964
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

574
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,208
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

575
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,568
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

576
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,042
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

577
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,245
But I'm sorry,
I will not bear arms.

578
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,005
His religious views
are certainly unique,

579
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,607
but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

580
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,729
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?

581
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,290
I don't know.

582
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,647
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,

583
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,087
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,

584
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,721
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.

585
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,488
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.

586
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,245
Yeah, you restrict him
to barracks and KP.

587
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,687
If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.

588
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,046
I want him gone.

589
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,602
Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!

590
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,524
- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!

591
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,161
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!

592
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,802
What you men fail to recognize

593
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,647
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!

594
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,044
Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.

595
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,566
You will all be on KP!

596
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,042
Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.

597
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,771
Let's go! Let's go.

598
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,648
Get your heads right.

599
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,967
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

600
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,123
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.

601
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,521
You dogs don't know what tired is.

602
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,807
We're going to keep going till I drop.

603
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,683
Hey, knock it off.
Trying to sleep here.

604
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,081
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.

605
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,684
Why the hell are you still here?

606
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,525
As you were.

607
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,126
Where's Doss?

608
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,210
This isn't good for anybody.

609
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,282
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

610
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,765
It's not about what you joined up for.

611
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,366
It's about the lives
of every man in here.

612
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,925
And yours, son.
It's time to quit this.

613
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,050
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.

614
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,049
It's okay, Doss.

615
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,165
There's no shame in this.

616
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,569
Let's go.

617
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,881
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

618
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,881
Can't.

619
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,970
All right, Doss.

620
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,130
Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?

621
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,883
No, Sarge.

622
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,123
Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?

623
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,123
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

624
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,724
Well, what the hell
are you saying, Doss?

625
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,962
You bruised half your body sleeping?

626
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,962
I... I sleep pretty hard.

627
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,524
Alright.

628
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,216
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.

629
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,651
Next.

630
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,848
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.

631
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,207
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?

632
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,851
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

633
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,849
- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.

634
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,056
You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.

635
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,887
At ease.

636
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,446
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.

637
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,007
This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.

638
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,287
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

639
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,201
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.

640
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,487
I'm getting married this afternoon.

641
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,450
It says you're not rifle qualified.

642
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,451
Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

643
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,763
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

644
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,724
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,

645
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,129
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."

646
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,010
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.

647
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,047
Pretty clear.

648
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,240
Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.

649
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,243
- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!

650
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,488
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

651
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,130
- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!

652
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,886
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

653
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,206
For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.

654
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,241
Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,

655
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,722
and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.

656
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,128
I can't, sir.

657
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,010
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

658
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,801
I think it's been long enough.

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,923
I'm so very sorry.

660
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,321
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

661
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,525
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

662
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,170
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch

663
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,005
who cares only about regulations
and not his men.

664
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,121
May I?

665
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,084
I believe in this book
as much as any man.

666
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,891
And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,

667
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,681
but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?

668
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,530
I don't know, sir.

669
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,169
I ain't got answers
to questions that big,

670
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,926
but I also feel like
my values are under attack,

671
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,565
and I don't know why.

672
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,645
I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

673
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,961
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,

674
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,041
what are you gonna do?

675
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,088
Hit him with your Bible?

676
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,401
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

677
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,041
You don't win wars
by giving up your life.

678
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,967
Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.

679
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,611
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

680
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,409
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

681
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,051
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

682
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,571
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

683
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,045
They wouldn't let me call you.

684
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,970
I knew it wasn't your making.

685
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,762
What have they done to you?

686
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,610
It's okay, I'm all right.

687
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,923
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.

688
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,209
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.

689
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,328
Leavenworth.

690
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,323
There must be some other way.

691
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,243
I don't know what that could be.

692
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,496
I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,

693
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,126
and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

694
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,524
You tried.
Nobody can say you didn't.

695
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,250
But who are you going to save in prison?

696
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,766
Probably nobody.

697
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,645
Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?

698
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,451
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.

699
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,721
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

700
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,770
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

701
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,730
Have I been prideful?

702
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,329
Maybe I am prideful.

703
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,416
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself

704
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,727
if I don't stay true
to what I believe.

705
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,242
Much less how you could live with me.

706
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,768
I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.

707
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,809
I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else

708
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,802
and you didn't try to be.

709
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,848
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.

710
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,206
I will love you no matter what.

711
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,889
I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.

712
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,760
<i>They want him to plead guilty,</i>

713
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,002
<i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i>

714
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,687
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.

715
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,683
<i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i>

716
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,410
<i>and I don't see how
he can live with that.</i>

717
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,563
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

718
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,400
If you get to talk to him,

719
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,720
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.

720
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,922
<i>We're praying for both of you.</i>

721
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,048
I will. Bye-bye.

722
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,216
<i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i>

723
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,765
<i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i>

724
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,650
<i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i>

725
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,609
<i>You leave this room.</i>

726
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,250
No, Tom! Put it down!

727
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,084
- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!

728
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,450
I got that, sir.

729
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,245
May I help you, sir?

730
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,891
I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.

731
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,804
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

732
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,408
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

733
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,280
Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.

734
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,364
He's in a very important meeting.

735
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,490
I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

736
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,363
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

737
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,007
Thank you, ma'am.

738
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,560
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

739
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,041
Doss?

740
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,526
Be over in a minute.

741
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,127
You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.

742
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,680
I love you.

743
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,696
This is a hearing into
the matter of Private Desmond Doss.

744
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,291
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders

745
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,566
from his commanding officer.

746
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,961
How says the defendant?

747
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,842
Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.

748
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,608
Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.

749
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,166
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.

750
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,440
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

751
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,211
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

752
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,490
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

753
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,724
Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.

754
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,290
Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us

755
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,488
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

756
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,246
He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders

757
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,560
from his commanding officer.

758
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,560
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...

759
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,441
- You okay?
- Yes.

760
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,170
Are they still deliberating?

761
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,446
Yes, sir.

762
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,284
Okay, now you go take this in there.

763
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,170
I can't.
It's strictly military personnel.

764
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,696
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.

765
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,007
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.

766
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,529
There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

767
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,321
Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

768
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,368
Well, do you, Private?

769
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,809
- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?

770
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,163
Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,

771
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,447
to serve in a combat unit?

772
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,367
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

773
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,402
Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.

774
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,766
There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.

775
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,366
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.

776
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,449
I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,

777
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,851
but that ain't right.

778
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,403
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,

779
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,081
that I would just be
sitting at home safe.

780
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,650
I need to serve.

781
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,290
I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.

782
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,841
Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

783
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,083
While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.

784
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,807
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,

785
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,882
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

786
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,440
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.

787
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,444
- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...

788
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,602
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

789
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,256
I understand, sir,
but nobody's allowed...

790
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,656
- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...

791
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,603
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,

792
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,490
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...

793
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,888
What the hell is going on out there?

794
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,290
Let him go.

795
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,481
- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.

796
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,483
Sir, I need to show you this.

797
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,689
With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.

798
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,650
You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.

799
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,769
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

800
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,128
You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,

801
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,123
and then you're done with?

802
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,521
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.

803
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
You were at Lys?

804
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,762
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

805
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,370
Twice decorated, I see.

806
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,329
Yes, sir.

807
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,846
I take it you are the Private's father.

808
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,809
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

809
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,601
Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...

810
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,331
Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.

811
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,687
They are framed in our constitution.

812
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,762
And I believe in them, as he does.

813
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,128
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.

814
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,362
At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.

815
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,885
Because if it wasn't for that,

816
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,440
then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.

817
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,563
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

818
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,171
Let me have the letter.

819
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,121
You must go.

820
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,566
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector

821
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,688
are protected by an Act of Congress

822
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,606
and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

823
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,208
That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

824
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,683
Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

825
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,091
Colonel?

826
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,769
- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.

827
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,162
Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle

828
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,210
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.

829
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,885
You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.

830
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,562
- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.

831
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,536
I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.

832
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,688
No, I understand.

833
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,683
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.

834
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,410
Okay. Okay.

835
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,691
You better come home to me.

836
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,848
<i>♪ Uncle Sam is mild</i>

837
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,570
<i>♪ He's peaceful as a child</i>

838
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,496
<i>♪ But never get him
riled or you'll be whipped ♪</i>

839
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,010
Hollywood, shut up.

840
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,525
Come on, pipe down.

841
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,376
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!

842
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,536
I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.

843
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,736
Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.

844
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,683
Killjoy was here.

845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,166
Give him room.

846
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,851
Clear! Clear! Move aside!

847
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,962
The 96th... or what's left of them.

848
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,849
These are the guys we're replacing.

849
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,486
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.

850
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,050
- As gold.
- Clear.

851
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,644
All clear, Sarge!

852
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,165
Captain Glover.

853
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,722
Lieutenant Manville, 96th.

854
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,689
We've been assigned to you, sir.

855
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,410
Okay.

856
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,576
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,965
This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.

858
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,376
- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.

859
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,447
Who's Doss?

860
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,251
Over there.

861
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,766
You Doss?

862
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,691
Irv Schecter.

863
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,365
You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.

864
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,410
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.

865
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,889
You just come off the line?

866
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,200
What's it like?

867
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,965
I said, What's it like?

868
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,290
Hacksaw.

869
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,491
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.

870
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,684
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.

871
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,006
They're animals.

872
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,043
Stinking animals.

873
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,282
Nips don't care if they live or die.

874
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,564
They want to die.
They keep coming at you.

875
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,211
And they ain't never going to give up.

876
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,770
Never.

877
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,683
Here. Hey, buddy.

878
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,409
The Japs
deliberately target the wounded.

879
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,484
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

880
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,801
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

881
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,330
The white is a bull's-eye.

882
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,723
Here, I got you a new helmet.

883
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,410
One size fits all.

884
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,649
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

885
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,401
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

886
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,484
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

887
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,321
Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.

888
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,328
Nobody can survive that shit.

889
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,409
Oh, but they can.

890
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,250
Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?

891
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,250
Yeah, there's three...

892
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,888
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

893
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,528
It's all different up there.

894
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,364
<i>All clear, Captain.</i>

895
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,525
Gents, move out.

896
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,290
It's blood.

897
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,600
No shit.

898
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,482
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

899
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,961
Keep climbing.

900
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,529
Here, come on.

901
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,921
Coming through, make way.
Out of the way.

902
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,806
- Brown.
- What?

903
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,961
Give this to Jessop.

904
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,041
Corporal!

905
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,487
Incoming!

906
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,086
Get down!

907
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,887
Get down!

908
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,686
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.

909
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,167
- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...

910
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,970
Medic!

911
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,202
We're over here!

912
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,727
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.

913
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,609
Come on, come on.

914
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,296
Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.

915
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,845
Come with me, Jack.

916
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,450
Keep moving forward! Move!

917
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,126
I can't see anything.

918
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,964
- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!

919
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,005
All right, let's go.

920
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,841
Vito!

921
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,965
Oh, shit.

922
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,640
- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!

923
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,802
Okay. I'm here.

924
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,086
Get out of the way!

925
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,561
You hurt?

926
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,964
I'm fine.

927
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,206
Come on, I got you, Ralph.
Just breathe.

928
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,284
Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,442
Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.

930
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,126
I got you, I got you.
I got you. Come on.

931
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,928
Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.

932
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,571
He's not going to last a day.

933
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,008
Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.

934
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,560
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.

935
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,563
I've got kids!

936
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,689
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.

937
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,764
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.

938
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,083
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.

939
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,888
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

940
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,560
It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.

941
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,602
We're going to get you shifted.

942
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,202
Stretcher! Stretcher!

943
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,682
- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.

944
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,000
There's nothing wrong with you.

945
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,411
Shit! Hang on, kid.

946
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,120
Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.

947
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,928
Move. Go, go, go!

948
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,684
This guy's a priority.

949
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,730
We got him, we got him. Here.

950
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,889
A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.

951
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,121
You don't know that!

952
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,126
Get him down. All right? Huh?

953
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,010
- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.

954
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,040
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.

955
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,641
Medic! Help! Help.

956
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,929
I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.

957
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,441
Help!

958
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,964
I got you, Frank. Where you hit?

959
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,083
- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.

960
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,366
Give me a hand here.

961
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,724
Get down, sir.

962
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,962
Over there! The bunkers.

963
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,771
I see them. Better stay down, sir.

964
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,327
- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.

965
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,656
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.

966
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,728
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.

967
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,963
You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?

968
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,804
I got him, Doss. I got him.

969
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,962
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.

970
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,087
Hey.

971
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,120
You doing okay?

972
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,281
Okay.

973
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,925
And, fire!

974
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,681
Down!

975
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,530
Son of a bitch.

976
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,683
- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!

977
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,889
Take 'em. Go. Fire!

978
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,891
Cover!

979
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,564
Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.

980
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,920
Go! Go, Smitty,
we'll cover you. Leapfrog.

981
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,200
Cover.

982
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,604
Satchel!

983
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,763
- Ghoul!
- Clear.

984
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,081
Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.

985
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,169
Cover! Cover!

986
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,684
Son of a bitch.

987
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,170
Cover his ass.

988
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,171
Medic! Medic! Help me.

989
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,561
Go!

990
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,360
Medic!

991
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,368
I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!

992
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,366
Go, go, go!

993
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,762
Ghoul. Ghoul.

994
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,169
You're okay. Where you hit?

995
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,722
You got a bump on the head, that's okay.

996
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,766
What's your name?

997
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,326
- Andy.
- Andy what?

998
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,491
Andy Walker.

999
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,369
Also known as?

1000
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,761
Ghoul.

1001
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,649
Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.

1002
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,967
Good job, men. Good work.

1003
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,566
Dig in for the night.
We hold this spot,

1004
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,211
we mop up the rest
of the ridge tomorrow.

1005
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,488
Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.

1006
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,483
Rotate watch every two hours.

1007
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,643
We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.

1008
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,529
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.

1009
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,331
- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.

1010
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,687
I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,

1011
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,762
it ain't safe to go out there alone.

1012
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,365
Over here, now!

1013
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,965
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

1014
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,642
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

1015
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,370
I'll go with him.

1016
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,488
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

1017
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,089
All right, let's find a spot.

1018
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,122
Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.

1019
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,561
Straight off.

1020
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,850
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

1021
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,011
Page and Unger.

1022
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,369
Ralston.

1023
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:18,289
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."

1024
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,210
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

1025
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,205
It don't help none.

1026
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,808
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

1027
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,170
Hey, give me that.

1028
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,885
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

1029
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,167
This man is going to need some plasma.

1030
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,605
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.

1031
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,808
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

1032
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,605
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1033
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,561
Sounds good to me.

1034
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,440
Put your helmet on.

1035
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,890
You ain't going to eat them?

1036
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,881
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

1037
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,681
Of course you don't.

1038
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,206
That's one heck of a dame.

1039
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,764
You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?

1040
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,609
Yes, I do.

1041
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,890
Don't tell her that.

1042
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,928
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.

1043
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,968
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1044
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,649
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1045
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,327
Sometimes?

1046
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,723
Yeah, all right. All right.

1047
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,365
These Japs are sneaky.

1048
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,846
I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.

1049
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,881
Hell of a dream.

1050
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,010
Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.

1051
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,801
Rifle's just there.

1052
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,120
It won't bite.

1053
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,006
Yeah, it will.

1054
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,491
Look around you.

1055
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,847
After what we've just been through,

1056
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,968
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

1057
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,963
I never claimed to be sane.

1058
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,684
My daddy's a drunk.

1059
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,050
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

1060
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,281
Made him mean.

1061
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,646
Least you knew him.

1062
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,963
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...

1063
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,410
So, your momma raised you?

1064
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,563
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.

1065
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,926
Never saw her again.

1066
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,844
I learned how to hate quick.

1067
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,881
I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.

1068
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,164
My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,

1069
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,368
and then whip us just because it set.

1070
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,331
I could take that...

1071
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,927
...but when he would
do it to our momma...

1072
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,162
Get away from me, woman!

1073
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,809
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

1074
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,723
Pull the damn trigger.

1075
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,362
Stop it! Stop!

1076
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,726
But you didn't kill him?

1077
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,329
In my heart, I did.

1078
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,723
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1079
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,882
I ain't never going to
touch a gun again.

1080
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,086
Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.

1081
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,446
Son of a...

1082
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,366
Son of a bitch.

1083
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,329
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

1084
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,731
Let's go!

1085
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,608
Fall back, fall back! Go!

1086
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,728
They're coming from underground.

1087
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,686
Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.

1088
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,650
Target is
Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

1089
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,688
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,

1090
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,400
but I don't expect to
be here much longer!

1091
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,724
I called an artillery strike.

1092
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,485
Fall back. Move. Move!

1093
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,122
Fall back! Incoming!

1094
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,807
Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.

1095
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,601
Okay.

1096
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,886
Cover me.

1097
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,921
Go, go!

1098
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,362
Get out of here, kid!

1099
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,400
Come here, son.

1100
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,446
You know what to do.
Keep pressure on it.

1101
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,721
No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.

1102
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,010
Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.

1103
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,764
- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?

1104
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,842
- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.

1105
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,485
Come on. Come on.

1106
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,850
We gotta move right now.
Come on, come on.

1107
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,124
Go! Go! Go!

1108
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,606
Change!

1109
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,929
There's too many,
get the hell out of here!

1110
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,729
Move! Move!

1111
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,844
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.

1112
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,963
No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.

1113
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,691
Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.

1114
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,486
- Hey!
- Yeah.

1115
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,016
Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.

1116
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,530
Yeah.

1117
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,045
Come on, let's move. Come on.

1118
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,088
Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.

1119
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,481
- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

1120
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,886
Let's go!

1121
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,931
Come on, let's go.

1122
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,804
Come on. Everyone.

1123
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,291
Off the ridge!

1124
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,448
What is it you want of me?

1125
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,125
I don't understand.

1126
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,090
I can't hear you.

1127
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,847
Medic, help me! Help me!

1128
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,649
Help me!

1129
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,124
Help me, Lord.

1130
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,770
All right.

1131
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,249
You're in good hands.
Easy does it. Easy.

1132
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,129
...six... eight...

1133
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,970
Fourteen.

1134
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,656
Get these men secured immediately.

1135
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,841
Yes, sir.

1136
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,562
- Private Ford, how many?
- Thirty-two only came down, sir.

1137
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,205
- Good Lord.
- Let's go!

1138
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,008
- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,400
Harry. It's Desmond.

1140
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,047
We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?

1141
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,085
- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.

1142
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,686
You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.

1143
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,330
- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.

1144
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,960
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,490
Help. Help me.

1146
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,928
Watch out. I got you.

1147
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,602
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.

1148
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,200
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.

1149
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,884
Easy, fellas, easy.

1150
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,246
Here we go.

1151
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,570
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three. One, two, three.

1152
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,001
Help, medic over here!

1153
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,400
It's okay, buddy, hold it together.

1154
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,042
We're at the edge, Eric.

1155
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,930
You just sit tight, okay?

1156
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,891
You're okay, Eric.
You're okay, buddy.

1157
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,001
Son of a gun, this is going to work.

1158
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,048
One for each leg, Eric.

1159
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,124
We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.

1160
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,964
I got you.

1161
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,369
I got you now, Eric.

1162
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,364
You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1163
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,286
Japs!

1164
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,523
Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!

1165
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,609
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1166
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,441
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.

1167
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,321
Hank, another one.

1168
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,047
Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.

1169
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,522
Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.

1170
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,921
Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.

1171
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,360
Sit down, Jack.
I'll get you a drink.

1172
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,450
We just lost our cover.

1173
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,287
They're stirrin',
we got to move. Come on.

1174
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,161
About time.
They just keep coming by the...

1175
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,891
- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.

1176
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,524
Doss. Doss.

1177
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,969
Help. Help me.

1178
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,365
You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.

1179
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,964
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

1180
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,051
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.

1181
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,407
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.

1182
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,576
You'll end up killing the rest of them.

1183
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,656
Then give me the reinforcements.

1184
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,446
I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.

1185
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,602
Three battalions got wiped out today.

1186
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,365
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.

1187
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,090
I need them faster than that.

1188
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,730
It's okay, it's okay.

1189
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,325
It's all right.
It's all right.

1190
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,565
Everything's okay.

1191
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,409
Morphine. It's good.

1192
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,922
Shh.

1193
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:05,170
Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.

1194
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,801
It's Doss. Be quiet.
Be quiet. I got you.

1195
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,884
- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.

1196
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,281
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

1197
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:21,643
Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.

1198
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,451
There you go. Try now. Try now.

1199
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,329
I thought I was blind!

1200
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,801
Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?

1201
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,251
I don't know.

1202
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,209
We got to get out of here, okay?
Come on.

1203
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,366
Good. Okay, we got you.

1204
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,720
We got you.

1205
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,244
Hey, Ted.

1206
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,688
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1207
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,609
- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.

1208
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,450
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

1209
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,204
Help me get one more.

1210
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,770
Please, help me get one more.

1211
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,850
One more. Help me get one more.

1212
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,250
One more. Help me get one more.

1213
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,725
One more.

1214
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,845
Coming through.

1215
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,364
Where the hell
are these guys coming from?

1216
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,641
From Hacksaw.

1217
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,451
- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.

1218
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,444
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.

1219
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,285
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

1220
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,489
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.

1221
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,283
Easy, easy. All set, move out.

1222
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,008
Get in here.
There's Nips everywhere.

1223
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,281
Son of a bitch.
Private Corn Stalk.

1224
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,408
You are nothing
if not full of surprises.

1225
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,323
You want some morphine?

1226
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,200
- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.

1227
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,521
There. There you go.

1228
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,562
All right, let me see. Let me see.

1229
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,524
How's this doing?
Okay, not bad.

1230
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,288
Let me see.

1231
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,885
It looks much worse than it is.

1232
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,880
Girls will still want to kiss you.

1233
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,609
Sarge, you okay here for a while?

1234
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,887
Yeah, fine. Get out of here.

1235
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,610
I'm coming back.

1236
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,808
You ready? Let's go.
You and me, come on.

1237
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,166
Captain.
There's something you gotta see.

1238
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,247
Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.

1239
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,720
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

1240
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,410
Come on, follow me.
He's right here.

1241
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,368
What the hell is this?

1242
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,930
How you doing, sir?

1243
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,365
Hey, Cap.

1244
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,601
Captain.

1245
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,970
- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.

1246
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,405
How'd you get down, son?

1247
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,484
Doss. Howell's still up there.

1248
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,046
What, Howell and Doss did this?

1249
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,168
Mostly just Doss.

1250
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,049
- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.

1251
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,600
Yeah, Doss, the coward.

1252
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,923
- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.

1253
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,401
It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?

1254
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:17,608
- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.

1255
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,489
No, I'm going to drag you.

1256
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,601
Let's do it.

1257
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,520
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1258
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,601
Let's go.

1259
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,971
We got company.

1260
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,610
Come on.

1261
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,565
Arms up.

1262
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,490
You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.

1263
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,520
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."

1264
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,444
Come on.

1265
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,326
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

1266
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,686
Get on.

1267
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,687
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.

1268
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:45,331
- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

1269
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,321
- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.

1270
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,560
We got him.

1271
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,449
That's good. That's good.

1272
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,522
It's okay, we got him.

1273
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,044
Whoa, whoa...

1274
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,930
- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.

1275
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,685
- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.

1276
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,446
Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.

1277
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,211
Desmond.

1278
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,284
Easy, easy. Here, come on.

1279
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,691
Are you wounded?

1280
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,683
Mmm...

1281
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,089
No. No.

1282
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,291
Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.

1283
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,840
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.

1284
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,160
Make some space.

1285
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,966
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.

1286
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,525
Where's Irv?

1287
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:20,410
- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.

1288
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,689
He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.

1289
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,566
Sorry.

1290
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,368
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.

1291
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,176
You've done more than
any other man could have done

1292
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,567
in the service of his country.

1293
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,166
And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

1294
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,762
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1295
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,608
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1296
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,971
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1297
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,561
Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.

1298
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,804
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.

1299
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,850
And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,

1300
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,689
and they want a piece of it.

1301
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,682
And they're not going
to go up there without you.

1302
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,776
<i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i>

1303
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,616
<i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>

1304
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:26,450
- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?

1305
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,924
For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.

1306
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,650
<i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i>

1307
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,529
<i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i>

1308
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,520
Let's go to work.

1309
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,323
Down. Get down!

1310
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,768
Get on the ground.
On the ground. Now!

1311
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,368
Lay down, lay down.
I got the morphine.

1312
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,923
Let's go, let's get
these men out of here.

1313
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:52,685
My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...

1314
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:55,525
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

1315
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:58,126
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

1316
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,087
Okay.

1317
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:19,405
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.

1318
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,727
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

1319
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,001
Desmond.

1320
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,049
<i>I was praying the whole time.</i>

1321
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,365
I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1322
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:29,571
When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1323
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,086
<i>I would say anyone is wrong</i>

1324
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,128
<i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i>

1325
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:43,329
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.

1326
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,803
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.

1327
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,850
That's what you are.

1328
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,561
<i>Even though I said those things to him</i>

1329
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,920
<i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i>

1330
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,610
then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1331
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:05,570
<i>But then, in the long run,</i>

1332
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:10,362
<i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i>

1333
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:13,205
And then to have him
end up saving my life

1334
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,443
was the irony of the whole thing.

1335
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:21,606
Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.

1336
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,731
He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.

1337
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:34,083
I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.

1338
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,007
And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.

1339
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:42,766
Man, he just lit up.

1340
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,805
He says, "I thought I was blind."

1341
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,963
And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war

1342
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:55,887
than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.

1343
02:10:55,987 --> 02:11:55,887
