1
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,580
<i>- Sí. Bueno.
- Family is everything.</i>

2
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,482
<i>No?</i>

3
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:35,988
<i>Now, do you love your son?</i>

4
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,724
Sí.

5
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:52,198
<i>Now... do you understand?</i>

6
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:56,675
<i>You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.</i>

7
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:08,301
Georgina!

8
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,674
Obey me, I will love you.
Come on.

9
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,542
That's how it works, huh?

10
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,811
<i>- Simple.
- That's right.</i>

11
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,818
Mwah.

12
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,256
She got a sister?

13
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,557
How's business?

14
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,565
The Japanese are here in a big way.

15
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,492
Cheap labor, factory space.

16
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:40,563
But they feel a lot safer living
over the border in El Paso.

17
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,735
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

18
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,745
- Ah.
- Come on.

19
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,449
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

20
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,354
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

21
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,520
Nah. Been movin' around,
you know.

22
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,691
Colombia, couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.

23
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh.

24
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,199
You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?

25
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,868
- No.
- You don't?

26
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:21,142
Me either.

27
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:26,050
- How long you staying?
- I don't know. I just... you know.

28
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:30,112
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

29
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,749
You know, I came by on impulse.

30
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,421
Well, I could do with some impulse.

31
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,566
What happened?

32
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,872
Family paid the ransom...

33
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,972
then they sent the kid home
after a couple of days...

34
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,244
minus an ear, of course.

35
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,981
Now every mother in Mexico City
with a little bit of money wants
bigger and better bodyguards...

36
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,057
my own wife included.

37
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,457
I hate to break it to you,
but she's right. She's right.

38
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:13,429
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh,
kidnap and ransom insurance.

39
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,765
I have a policy. A.I.G.
My dad gave it to me.

40
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:20,136
Yeah, I know.
I got it for your dad.

41
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,176
<i>But what are you gonna do in 60 days
when you can't renew it?</i>

42
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,543
- You can't because
you don't have a bodyguard.
- I had to let Emilio go.

43
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:31,277
You gotta please Lisa.
I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

44
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,987
Look, a bodyguard's
like anything else.

45
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:41,357
You get what you pay for, okay?

46
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,454
You could do this.
You get one that's got a decent résumé.

47
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,897
We're not looking for
goddamn Superman here, right?

48
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,731
Get someone cheap
till you renew the policy...

49
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,204
and then, uh...
then fire the prick for whatever.

50
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,366
Incompetence.

51
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:59,879
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school...

52
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,950
and that your wife gets to save face.

53
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,851
This way, you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighborhood.

54
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:23,665
<i>That's right. A bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.</i>

55
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:27,172
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

56
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,742
In my state,
I couldn't guard a corpse.

57
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,642
<i>It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show.</i>

58
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:37,878
<i>- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Yeah? You think they'd hire
a drunk, a has-been?</i>

59
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,852
You have to keep it under control.

60
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:47,724
What if there was, you know, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

61
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,855
<i>You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.</i>

62
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,560
<i>- I don't know.
- It's not exactly a scam, Crease.</i>

63
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:58,900
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,201
Bodyguard's gotta be close
to people though.

65
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,141
He gotta talk all the time,
and I'm no good at that.

66
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,772
You'll be the silent type.
People are gonna appreciate that.

67
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,589
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

68
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,592
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

69
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,492
<i>He owns one of the plants in Juárez.</i>

70
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,531
<i>Yeah?</i>

71
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,431
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

72
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,471
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

73
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,440
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

74
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:38,068
He asked me if I knew
anybody he could trust.

75
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,639
- And you thought of me.
- Yeah.

76
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,151
Take a job, Crease.
Breathe some air.

77
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,619
<i>Then decide if you want
to stick around or not.</i>

78
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,818
<i>Besides, I'm glad to see you.
I got nobody to talk to down here.</i>

79
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,202
Listen, my wife wants someone
presentable and polite.

80
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:09,100
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

81
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,939
Your résumé's quite impressive.

82
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:15,505
<i>Sixteen years of military experience,
extensive counterterrorism work.</i>

83
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,177
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

84
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,550
I drink.

85
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,646
How does that affect you?

86
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,225
Well...

87
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,454
coordination, reaction time.

88
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:32,328
If top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can...

89
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,459
but the service will be
on par with the pay.

90
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:38,629
What if amateurs tried?

91
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,867
I'd probably kill 'em.
Is that likely?

92
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,944
No.

93
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,808
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

94
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,471
<i>Lisa!</i>

95
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,579
Lisa!

96
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,693
My wife, Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

97
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,965
- You're an American.
- So are you.

98
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,803
It's all in there.

99
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,778
Would you like a drink?

100
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,610
Yes, uh, Jack and water'd be good.

101
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,711
<i>- Have you done much
of this kind of work before?
- No, ma'am.</i>

102
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,587
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

103
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,790
- You have a family, Mr. Creasy?
- No.

104
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,092
Pita.

105
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,167
<i>Pita.</i>

106
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,595
<i>- Thank you.
- Yes, Mom?</i>

107
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,605
Honey, this is, uh, Mr. Creasy.

108
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,246
In English, honey.

109
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,976
Um, do you wanna show
Mr. Creasy to his room?

110
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,781
- This way, Mr. Creasy.
- Okay.

111
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,195
Thank you.

112
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,936
Just like that?

113
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,441
I think it's nice...

114
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,011
that he's an American.

115
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:03,311
I think it's terrific. You sure?

116
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,284
Thank you.

117
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,017
Thank you.

118
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,593
I feel better now.

119
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:18,397
<i>- ¡Hola, Bruno!
- ¡Buenas tardes!</i>

120
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,797
That's Bruno, the gardener.

121
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,960
And, um, that's Maria, the cook.

122
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,868
<i>- ¡Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.</i>

123
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:32,169
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

124
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:39,183
<i>You've got a TV and C.D. Player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?</i>

125
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,652
I don't know.

126
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,246
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

127
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,521
That's Bird.

128
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,495
Emilio forgot to take him
when he left.

129
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,997
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

130
00:13:56,003 --> 00:14:00,235
Have you protected a lot of children
before, Mr. Creasy?

131
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,105
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

132
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,110
Creasy.

133
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,146
Bye, Creasy.

134
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,909
So long.

135
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,747
Bye, Bird.

136
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,756
Ow.

137
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,222
- School tomorrow, peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

138
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,102
<i>Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.</i>

139
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,899
Yeah, we'll see.

140
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,805
If you get a dog,
will you give up your bear?

141
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,242
You're getting too old for him.

142
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,747
<i>- How'd you like Mr. Creasy?
- Creasy.</i>

143
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,216
He said to call him just Creasy.

144
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,787
- Uh-huh.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?

145
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,186
No, not if he asked you.

146
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,123
Here. There you go.

147
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:04,768
- He's like a bear too.
- Yeah?

148
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,170
A big, sad bear.

149
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,438
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

150
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,150
- Good night, honey.
- Night.

151
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,853
- Oh, can you get me
some floss in the morning?
- Floss?

152
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,485
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.
- Oh, sure.

153
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,856
Good night, Bear.

154
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,935
Creasy Bear.

155
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,802
What's that one for?

156
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,805
<i>La Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

157
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:18,310
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

158
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,040
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one.

159
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,708
I don't know.

160
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,752
She likes him.

161
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,652
- What are you talking about?
- Creasy.

162
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,855
Pita likes him.

163
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,863
Pita loves school.

164
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:43,164
<i>Pita would love Count Dracula
if he took her back there, honey.</i>

165
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,238
Okay?

166
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,575
<i>- Hey. Are you okay?
- I don't know.</i>

167
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,773
Okay?

168
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,316
I don't know, Lisa.

169
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,385
I'm trying.

170
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,543
Come on, Bird.

171
00:17:56,643 --> 00:18:00,010
That's right.
That's right. Come on.

172
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,276
All right. Home to Emilio.

173
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,250
You're home free, baby.

174
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,137
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The U.S.

175
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,177
<i>- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.</i>

176
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,270
You can drive and talk
at the same time.

177
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,849
No, I can't, Pita, so, please,
let me just do my job.

178
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,020
Are you going to stay?

179
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,023
My last bodyguard left.

180
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,992
Somebody gave him
more money than we could.

181
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:52,054
I guess that makes me
a bargain then, huh?

182
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:56,568
Being black... is that a positive or negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

183
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,570
Time will tell.

184
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:06,341
There were 24 kidnappings
in Mexico City in the last six days.

185
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,346
- Four a day.
- Yeah?

186
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,916
- Twenty-four?
- Twenty-four. What do you
think about that, Creasy?

187
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:14,681
- I think that you know
entirely more than you should.
- Well, thank you.

188
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,439
<i>Hola, Miguel.</i>

189
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,848
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

190
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:49,251
- What?
- You have to sign in, show them your I.D.

191
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,792
<i>Buenos días. Come on.</i>

192
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,860
Right there.

193
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,590
<i>- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.</i>

194
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,276
<i>- ¡Hola, Pita!
- ¡Hola!</i>

195
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:15,576
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

196
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,583
Sister Anna, this is
my new bodyguard, Creasy.

197
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,813
Sister Anna, the headmistress.

198
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,947
<i>Señor Creasy.</i>

199
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,957
Hurry. Class is about to begin.

200
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,391
- Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

201
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,986
<i>- Madre.
- You must look after our Pita.</i>

202
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,293
It is not good that she's late today.

203
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,962
I'm very sorry. I, uh... I'll have to get
used to the rules. It won't happen again.

204
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,632
No offense, but I regret
that your profession needs to exist.

205
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,870
<i>So do I, Madre. So do I.</i>

206
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,937
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

207
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,677
No, not for a long time.

208
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:56,153
The Bible says,
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome..."

209
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,692
"Overcome evil with good."

210
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,630
<i>I'm the sheep that got lost, Madre.</i>

211
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:15,092
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

212
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,865
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

213
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:22,874
No, I don't remember.
It, uh... Nah, I didn't like it.

214
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,035
Why not?

215
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,705
Because it wasn't a school like yours.

216
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,782
There was no, uh... no Sister Anna.

217
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,813
Were you unhappy?

218
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,424
Being unhappy, Pita, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

219
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,963
What happened to your hand?

220
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,406
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

221
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:59,774
Look, no more questions, okay?

222
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,246
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question.

223
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,943
<i>Look, I got a job to do. Hey!</i>

224
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,281
<i>No. Gracias. Gracias. No. No.</i>

225
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,322
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you, okay?

226
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:13,392
No, no, no. I'm being paid
to be your bodyguard.

227
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,587
<i>Look at me.
I'm not being paid to be your friend.</i>

228
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:20,257
<i>I'm being paid to protect you,
so no more questions. That's it. Period.</i>

229
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,766
<i>- You hear me?
- Yes.</i>

230
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:30,309
- And no crying.
- I'm not crying.

231
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,470
Well, don't start.

232
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,014
You gotta understand, this is a job.

233
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,914
In order for me to do...

234
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,953
In order for... Wait a minute.

235
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,571
Yeah, come in.

236
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,339
Mr. Creasy.

237
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,245
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

238
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,318
I'm fine, thanks.

239
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,753
Is the food all right?
'Cause, uh, Maria told me you didn't eat.

240
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:54,315
Uh... yeah, the food is great.

241
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:56,918
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

242
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,894
So you, uh, read the Bible?

243
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,632
Yeah, sometimes.

244
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,506
- Does it help?
- Yeah, sometimes.

245
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:16,111
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

246
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:21,079
How are you doing with Pita?

247
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,087
Fine. Fine.

248
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,454
Soon as she figures out that I'm
not her new toy, we'll be fine.

249
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,528
- Yeah, she told me about that.
- Okay.

250
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,258
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

251
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,824
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

252
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:41,270
<i>- And Pita just wants to be friends.
- Okay.</i>

253
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,003
But you're paying me to protect her,
right? Not to be her friend.

254
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,079
Right?

255
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,780
So, uh...

256
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,410
look, maybe this isn't
gonna work out.

257
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:58,480
Maybe your husband should find
somebody who's a little more sociable.

258
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,261
No, you're right.

259
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,700
You're being paid to protect her...

260
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:12,169
and I'm confident that you'll do that.

261
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:20,076
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

262
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,970
<i> You think God
will forgive us for what we've done?</i>

263
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,371
<i>I'm tired of killin', Ray.</i>

264
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:31,045
<i>You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?</i>

265
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,643
<i>In my state, I couldn't...
I couldn't guard a corpse.</i>

266
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,245
<i>Talk all the time.</i>

267
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,348
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

268
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,656
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

269
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,091
<i>You know how they say...</i>

270
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,569
<i>a bullet always tells the truth?</i>

271
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,647
Yeah.

272
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,908
- Hey.
- Crease.

273
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,711
What's wrong?

274
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:42,254
Hey, listen, you-you ever have a...

275
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,823
a nine-millimeter round
that didn't go off?

276
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,722
Well, yeah. Failure to fire.

277
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,955
I know.
Failure to fire and-and-and, uh...

278
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,931
You know, I pulled the trigger
and... and... and...

279
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,933
click, nothing.

280
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,333
You're talking about a bad primer.

281
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,497
Yeah, I... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

282
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,098
But I... You know, right, dimple.
Dimple on the primer.

283
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,302
That may be.

284
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,006
Well, like we used to say...

285
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:12,983
a bullet always tells the truth.

286
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,919
Crease?

287
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,689
- You all right?
- Yeah.

288
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,363
What were you shooting at?

289
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,594
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry I woke you.

290
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:34,162
No, i-it's okay. Nothin'.
I was watchin' TV.

291
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,107
Okay.

292
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,473
All right.

293
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,883
Pita, you have a pencil?

294
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,024
Thank you.

295
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,428
It's hard to get used to
the traffic down here.

296
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:44,628
Yeah. I'm very sorry.

297
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,422
- See you, baby.
- All right. See you later.

298
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,791
- Hey. Don't forget your towel.
- Oh, thank you.

299
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,895
<i>Bye. Buenas días.</i>

300
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:27,838
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

301
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,113
Thanks.

302
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,852
<i>- So what do I do?
- What do you think you should do?</i>

303
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:45,014
You're the fastest one in the water,
the slowest one off the blocks.

304
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:48,560
- What do you think that means?
What do you gotta do?
- Get faster off the blocks.

305
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:50,891
Get faster off the blocks.

306
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:54,364
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

307
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,231
<i>- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- Yeah, you'll be fine.</i>

308
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,304
You'll be okay.

309
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:04,276
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

310
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,971
I never finish better than third.

311
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,946
All right.
Maybe you are slow then.

312
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,495
<i>Go! ¡Vamos!</i>

313
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:30,796
<i>¡Vamos, Bird!</i>

314
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,871
¡Vamos!

315
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,372
<i>How do you think he got out?</i>

316
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,175
- I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right?

317
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,150
It's better for him.

318
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,818
<i>Actually, he was driving me crazy.</i>

319
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,330
Good night.

320
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,298
Good night.

321
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,380
- See you in a couple of days. I love you.
- All right. Love you.

322
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,389
Be good. Come on, Lise.

323
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:28,983
- All right, sweetheart.
We'll call you from Detroit.
- Okay.

324
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:32,030
- I love you.
- Love you.

325
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,099
<i>- Okay. Bye, honey.
- Señora.</i>

326
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,293
<i>- Bye.
- Oh. Gracias.</i>

327
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,870
<i>- Okay. Bye, honey!
- Bye.</i>

328
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,269
- I love you.
- Love you.

329
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:47,640
I hate leaving her.

330
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,587
Concentratin'?

331
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,926
Eyes are closed?

332
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,636
What happened?

333
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,261
- I flinched.
- You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

334
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,169
- Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear.

335
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,708
The gunshot holds no fear! Say it.

336
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,778
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

337
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,847
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

338
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,059
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

339
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,171
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

340
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,274
You welcome the sound.

341
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,683
In fact, it's the sound
that sets you free.

342
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:31,723
You are a prisoner on this block
until that sound sets you free.

343
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:34,190
- Are you ready? Are you ready?
- Yes. Yes.

344
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,885
- Are you set?
- Uh-huh.

345
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:45,137
- Creasy?
- Hmm?

346
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,400
- What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask?

347
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,907
It's in my history book.

348
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,740
- Oh.
- It's like a wife, right?

349
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:57,145
Yeah. Yes, uh... Can I see that?

350
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,774
- Kind of a wife.
- Right there.

351
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,013
But the emperor of China
had 1,000 of them.

352
00:37:03,122 --> 00:37:05,056
Um...

353
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:09,253
Okay, like nowadays in-in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

354
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,921
But in the olden time cultures,
they had, uh...

355
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,626
you know, different...
uh, different rules.

356
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:20,267
- Why, you feel sorry for the husband?
- Yeah.

357
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,772
Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

358
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:29,270
Creasy. You're smiling.

359
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,975
- What?
- You were smiling.

360
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,177
- No, I'm not. No, I was not.
- You were.

361
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,686
- You're not now, but you were.
- You were smiling. I wasn't.

362
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,586
- You were.
- When?

363
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,182
- Like five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

364
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,820
- A second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

365
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,125
- Six seconds ago I wasn't smiling.
- Ten seconds ago.

366
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:50,862
Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in
the next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.

367
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,637
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- Mmm!

368
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,212
- No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
- Yeah, you...

369
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:03,543
That's not a smile.
A smirk is different.

370
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:07,517
They both start with "S," but they're
not the same... Do your homework.

371
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,588
You were.

372
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,693
Bang!

373
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,229
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

374
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,163
Bang!

375
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:25,135
<i>Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop. Come here.</i>

376
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,569
<i>Hurry up, hurry up. Set.</i>

377
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,402
Bang!

378
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,636
Bang!

379
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,149
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

380
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:42,018
You listen for the sound.
You don't anticipate.

381
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,715
- Concentrate on the sound.
You understand me?

382
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:47,190
They're gaining on you!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Stop! Stop!

383
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:50,421
Come on, get out.
Let's go again. Let's go again.

384
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:11,283
<i>- Gracias. Come here, girl!
- Daddy!</i>

385
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:14,181
Oh, I missed you so much.

386
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:16,948
- I missed you too.
- How are you doing? I got a surprise for you.

387
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:19,251
- You do?
- Ready?

388
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,849
- Huh?
- You got me a dog! You finally got me a dog!

389
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:25,453
<i>- Huh?
- You bought me a dog, finally! Oh, my God!</i>

390
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,691
<i>- What do you think?
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

391
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,769
- Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam, like Dad.

392
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,703
Great! Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!

393
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,774
- State.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,208
Bhutan.
It's a Himalayan kingdom.

395
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:44,805
<i>They were having some problems
with their royal family not that long ago.</i>

396
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,647
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.</i>

397
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:50,950
Any more questions?

398
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,956
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- What?

399
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,049
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

400
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,424
<i>What kind of question is that?
You're supposed to be studying history.</i>

401
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,987
- That is history. Creasy history.
- No, that's ancient history.

402
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,727
<i>- No more questions.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?</i>

403
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,827
Nonya. Nonya business.
That's who.

404
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:10,170
<i>- Okay?
- Hi.</i>

405
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:13,973
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

406
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,809
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

407
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:20,477
Well, um, I'll leave you two
to your history.

408
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,851
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, honey.</i>

409
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,986
- Okay, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

410
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:39,428
Go, Pita, go. Go! Go, go, go, go!

411
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,098
Go, go, go, go, go.

412
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,507
- ¡Bravo! ¡Muy bien!

413
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,008
- 10.99.
- Yes!

414
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,549
<i>Whoo!</i>

415
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,882
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

416
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:58,354
There's trained,
then there's untrained.

417
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,152
<i>- Now, which are you?
- Trained.</i>

418
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:02,454
Trained. Okay. Let's go again.

419
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:13,030
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

420
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,072
Okay. Hey.

421
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:18,371
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

422
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,877
- Don't smile, don't fool around
if you want to win.
- Okay.

423
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,971
- You want to win? Trained or untrained?
- Trained.

424
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,380
Go.

425
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:29,921
<i>- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Madre.</i>

426
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:32,923
Pita's parents are away
on business in Juárez. I was...

427
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:35,653
Today you are her father.

428
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:00,737
<i>Pita Ramos!</i>

429
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:09,886
I won! Creasy! I won!

430
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:13,583
- Okay.
- I won!

431
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:26,968
<i>- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When I was young.</i>

432
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:30,166
Well, when we were young
and he was younger...

433
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,005
all heads turned our way.

434
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,774
We made a deal
to take the world together.

435
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:39,715
<i>Yeah, then one day
I got a call, and he said...</i>

436
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:43,117
"I'm in love! I'm in love!

437
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:45,986
<i>And I'm moving to Mexico. "</i>

438
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,457
<i>And... I said...</i>

439
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,223
- "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

440
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:54,424
I said, "The plan's right here."

441
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:57,001
Yeah. Yeah. And what'd I do?

442
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,502
I hung up, then I met Alicia...

443
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:03,803
and then I went,
"Oh, now I got you! I got you."

444
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,639
I got it. Can I kiss her? Is that...

445
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:10,374
Absolutely!
Hey, what are you doing?

446
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:20,718
- You got me.
- Okay, I think now is a good a time as any.

447
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:26,325
I bought it with my own money.

448
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,062
Open it.

449
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:42,903
It's St. Jude,
patron saint of lost causes.

450
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,846
Wow.

451
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,719
Well deserved.

452
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:55,552
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

453
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,096
You're welcome.

454
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:50,509
<i>- Dad.
- Yes, sweetie?</i>

455
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:52,516
Can I talk to you?

456
00:45:52,618 --> 00:45:54,745
Yes.

457
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:58,084
I don't want to play piano.
I want to swim.

458
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,624
It's not open for discussion,
honey, okay?

459
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:04,594
Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher,
and if he accepts you as his student...

460
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,664
you're gonna play the piano.

461
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,699
Whatever.

462
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,268
Baby.

463
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,930
- I love you.
- I love you.

464
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,440
- I just want what's best
for you, you know that?
- Okay.

465
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,533
Okay, honey.

466
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,548
If you broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together...

467
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:35,627
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

468
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:38,059
Sam, get back.

469
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:41,030
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

470
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,601
<i>Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

471
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:49,670
- Remember the day you wanted the pencil?
- Yeah.

472
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,266
I know why.

473
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:55,835
- Yeah?
- You wanted the license number
off of that car.

474
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:58,643
I wrote it down in my notebook.

475
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,514
I got it all but the last number.

476
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,680
I'll get it from you lat...
Can you belch?

477
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,850
Burp. Can you burp?

478
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:13,595
That's good. That's very good.

479
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,759
- I just had a Coke.
- All right. Listen.

480
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:19,166
Now, this teacher,
this famous teacher...

481
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:22,399
He teaches a lot of rich kids
and plays for the symphonies, right?

482
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,135
- Right.
- You belch every few minutes
while you're practicing.

483
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:27,507
- Okay.
- You apologize to him, but you keep belching.

484
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,206
- You'll offend every sensibility he has.
- Okay.

485
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:34,046
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

486
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:37,280
Right, Sam?

487
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:44,423
<i>- Hola.

My Russian is better than my English.

Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and
we neither need nor want police assistance.

No. Okay.

00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:28,378
The kidnapper will tell you

<i>Por favor, don't do that...</i>

Oh, Miguel Manzano...

<i>- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.</i>

549
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:21,226
Señor, if your daughter's life...

550
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,699
is as important to you
as it is to me...

551
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,168
you will do as I say.

00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:30,866
- Yes?
- Okay. Yes.

553

- Crease. Can you hear me?
- Hmm.

554
00:58:37,215 --> 00:58:39,410
You got four of them. All dead.

555
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:44,280
- Pita.
- It's, uh...

556
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:50,917
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.

557
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:56,794
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

558
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:03,037
Crease.

559
00:59:05,243 --> 00:59:08,212
Don't fuck with me, all right?

560
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:17,419
Do you have the 10 million?
Do you have the money?

561
00:59:17,522 --> 00:59:21,982
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now if you do as I say...

562
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:26,291
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

563
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,730
<i>But if you deviate from
the process in any way...</i>

564
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:35,201
I swear,
you will never see her again.

565
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:38,275
<i>I understand. Listen, I-I too worship
la Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

566
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:40,173
I ask you if you understand.

567
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:46,312
Hello, sir.
This is, uh, Mr. Ramos's attorney.

568
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,648
<i>He's going through a very difficult
time here, but he understands.</i>

<i> Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.</i>

570
00:59:53,324 --> 00:59:56,760
<i>Okay, the money, 10 million,
U.S., will be divided into...</i>

571
00:59:56,861 --> 01:00:00,058
<i>two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million...</i>

572

<i>which will be checked
at the bank by the K.R. Agent...</i>

573
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:07,170
<i>then driven to the house in
an armored car where it will be
transferred to the delivery car.</i>

574
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,798
You got a flat tire here.

Hello. Yeah.

577
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:19,141
Listen, I need a driver
to drive Samuel.

578
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,480
<i>No. Why?</i>

579
01:00:21,586 --> 01:00:25,386
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

580
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,653
Look, he's a nervous kid
who doesn't respond well to stress.

581
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:35,456
All right.
But the car will not be powerful.

582
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:40,697
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

583
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:45,242
<i>You will arrive at
La Diana Fountain at 1:00 a.m.</i>

the circle two times.

585
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:54,512
<i>Samuel will remove his shirt

586
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,519
to I.D. The car.

587
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:01,717
<i>There is a pay phone
on the southeast corner.</i>

588
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:07,264
<i>The phone will ring.
He will answer and wait for instructions.</i>

589
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,199
<i>There is a map on the top of the phone.
Follow it.</i>

590
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,204
<i>Perfecto.</i>

591
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,505
- What are you doing? He said no phones!
- Relax. Relax.

592
01:01:24,615 --> 01:01:28,107
- I'm just trying to protect your daughter.
- Just get me there, please.

593
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:37,450
- What's going on?
- Hospitals can be very dangerous places.

594
01:01:37,562 --> 01:01:41,430
Especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

595
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:57,941
<i> Leave the money
in the trunk of the white car.</i>

596
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:00,347
<i>Then return to your car.</i>

597
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,878
<i>Do not look back.</i>

598
01:02:23,174 --> 01:02:27,235
<i>Remember, I'm a professional.</i>

599
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:31,475
<i>If you keep your word,
I will keep mine.</i>

600
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,620
- Hello.

601
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:50,258
<i>You betrayed me.
You killed my nephew.</i>

602
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:52,495
You took my money.

01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:57,040
<i>Señor Ramos...</i>

604
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:04,437
All right. Get out of here, all of you.
Get the fuck out of my house!

605
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,812
Okay, this is Lisa.

606
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:12,385
I'm Pita's mother.

607
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:16,756
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

608
01:03:20,498 --> 01:03:24,662
This conversation
is not being recorded.

609
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:32,198
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, senora.

610
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:35,575
I'm really sorry.

611
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,707
Now it is too late.

612
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:52,719
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house now!

613
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,497
Get out! Get out!

614
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:39,876

01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:53,954
- Where am I?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

618
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:01,227
Manzano was afraid the cops
were gonna kill you.

619
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,735
How ya doin', Doc?

620
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,971
What's the matter?

621
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:17,507
She's de... dead, Crease.

622
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,117
<i>It's a mess.</i>

623
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,585
<i>Somebody hijacked the drop,
and, uh...</i>

624
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,352
<i>the kidnapper's nephew was killed...</i>

625
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:32,929
so he k... he killed Pita.

626
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,386
No.

627
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:15,639
No.

628
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:24,371
Did you recognize any of these men?

629
01:06:25,883 --> 01:06:30,149
No. Does that make me a suspect?

630
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:32,882
No.

631
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,015
It would be convenient, but no.

632
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:39,084
Um, maybe you should show me
some pictures of some Mexican cops.

633
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:41,177
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

634
01:06:41,212 --> 01:06:43,159
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

635
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:45,394
Bad judicial cops.

636
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:50,506

01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:52,508

I'll get you up to the border.

That's right.

Came to get my stuff.

692
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:59,829
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

It's crazy, huh?

695
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,334
One week we're figuring out
which nightclub to go to...

696
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:14,433
and the next thing
I'm reading the Bible.

697
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:18,275
It's a good thing.
You hold on to it.

698
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:27,680
I keep thinking,

699
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,288
It's like, um...

my whole life,
all I've ever thought about...

701

was what I could get for myself.

01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:44,863
Even with my own baby.

703
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:50,702
She needed me so much,
and sometimes...

704
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:54,614
I felt like I had nothing to give her.

705
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,346
Just, um, I don't know what to do.

Well, no, excuse me.

I got everything but the last digit,
so I need 10 possible matches.

720
01:17:49,793 --> 01:17:52,921
And when do I find out
which of the 10 it is?

775
01:30:04,394 --> 01:30:07,329
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me!
Did you kill her?

776
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,159
Oh, man, you're making me
fucking nervous.

777
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:12,166
- Did you kill her?
- No way. The fucking boss did, or his brother.

778
01:30:14,904 --> 01:30:17,600
- We never see his face.
- You're not lying to me, are you?

779
01:30:17,707 --> 01:30:19,937
No. Goddamn it! I'm telling you the truth!

780
01:30:20,043 --> 01:30:22,568
Tell me, who?
You never see whose face?

781
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:25,011
<i>Well, we were in the other room...</i>

782
01:30:25,114 --> 01:30:28,345
<i>and he was yellin' at the girl
'cause his nephew got killed...</i>

783
01:30:28,451 --> 01:30:30,851
<i>and the money got stolen.</i>

784
01:30:30,954 --> 01:30:32,854
Wait, wait. Wh-What?
Somebody stole what money?

785
01:30:32,956 --> 01:30:35,754
- The ransom money at the drop.
- Who? Who stole it?

786
01:30:35,858 --> 01:30:38,258
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.
- Who?

787
01:30:38,361 --> 01:30:40,522
- Fuentes.
- Fuentes?

788
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:42,689
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

789
01:30:42,799 --> 01:30:45,427
<i>All right? Huh? Jersey boy?</i>

790
01:30:45,535 --> 01:30:49,437
Yeah. Now.

791
01:30:50,707 --> 01:30:53,369
<i>- This Fuentes guy?
- Yeah.</i>

792
01:30:53,476 --> 01:30:55,876
<i>He's a lieutenant for
the Anti-Kidnapping Division.</i>

793
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:58,470
Fuentes is. What'd you do?

794
01:30:58,581 --> 01:31:01,141
- Oh, man.
- Tell me about the girl. What'd you do?

795
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,810
<i>- Huh? What'd you do?
- I just do what they told me.</i>

796
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,319
- You do what they tell you to do?
- Yeah.

797
01:31:05,421 --> 01:31:07,889
Did you say good-bye to her?
Answer my question.

798
01:31:07,991 --> 01:31:09,982
- Did you say good-bye to her?
- No!

799
01:31:10,093 --> 01:31:12,561
- You didn't? Here's your chance. Say good-bye.
- Oh, shit!

800
01:31:12,662 --> 01:31:15,392
Say good-bye to her.
Say good-bye to her.

801
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:17,625
Fucking let me go!

802
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:22,635
Rico?

803
01:32:03,813 --> 01:32:05,713
Okay. Okay.

804
01:32:22,665 --> 01:32:24,189
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

805
01:32:41,851 --> 01:32:43,682
<i>Sí.</i>

806
01:32:46,389 --> 01:32:48,653
<i>Sí.</i>

807
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:25,913
<i>- Sí, Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.</i>

808
01:34:26,022 --> 01:34:29,116
Yeah, it's me. You know anything about
a young girl being kidnapped recently?

809
01:34:29,225 --> 01:34:32,388
- She's about 12 years old?
- Yes, that's last night.

810
01:34:32,495 --> 01:34:34,224
- Do you know something?
- What's her name?

811
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:36,321
Uh, Camilla. Camilla Valencias.

812
01:34:36,432 --> 01:34:39,731
<i>¿Camilla?
¿Se llama Camilla?</i>

813
01:34:39,836 --> 01:34:41,667
<i>- Sí.
- Okay. I got her.</i>

814
01:34:41,771 --> 01:34:44,501
Where are you?

815
01:35:14,237 --> 01:35:17,035
<i>- Creasy, what happened?
- It's okay.</i>

816
01:35:17,139 --> 01:35:19,107
Sit down. Relax.

817
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:22,041
She's okay. She's okay.
You got banking connections?

818
01:35:22,144 --> 01:35:25,545
Yes, I have connections.

819
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,865
Okay. The PI N number's 4747.

820
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,481
Okay. The PI N number's 4747.

821
01:35:30,586 --> 01:35:34,078
I wanna find out who's
putting money in that account.

822
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:37,751
4747.

823
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,294
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

824
01:35:40,396 --> 01:35:42,626
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

825
01:35:42,732 --> 01:35:45,132
<i>He's the one who drove
Samuel Ramos to the drop.</i>

826
01:35:45,234 --> 01:35:46,826
- Fuentes?
- Sí.

827
01:35:46,936 --> 01:35:50,929
<i>- Who is she?
- You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.</i>

828
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,838
- What do you know about him?
About Fuentes?

829
01:35:53,943 --> 01:35:57,344
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

830
01:35:57,446 --> 01:35:59,141
<i>- Huh.
- Never charged.</i>

831
01:35:59,248 --> 01:36:02,115
Arresting officer couldn't testify
'cause he was dead.

832
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,119
<i>- Is he La Hermandad?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

833
01:36:06,222 --> 01:36:09,749
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a judicial compound.

834
01:36:11,694 --> 01:36:14,595
He travels by motorcade.

835
01:36:17,967 --> 01:36:20,333
<i>Creasy, he's better protected
than the president of Mexico.</i>

836
01:36:20,436 --> 01:36:22,700
He's gonna need it.
You gonna take care of her?

837
01:36:22,805 --> 01:36:25,330
- Yes. Well, how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

838
01:36:53,102 --> 01:36:57,038
This is my jurisdiction.

839
01:36:57,139 --> 01:37:01,542
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

840
01:37:01,644 --> 01:37:06,707
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than 10 years of your courts and tribunals.

841
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:10,149
- Just stay out of his way.
- I plan to.

842
01:37:17,593 --> 01:37:21,051
I will even help him, if I can.

843
01:37:21,163 --> 01:37:25,327
But, uh, I would like to
understand him.

844
01:37:27,169 --> 01:37:28,830
Give me that.

845
01:37:28,938 --> 01:37:31,566
Pita Ramos...

846
01:37:33,142 --> 01:37:35,042
that's a number to you.

847
01:37:35,144 --> 01:37:40,081
You know, one more dead,
but a number.

848
01:37:40,182 --> 01:37:42,776
What was she to Creasy then?

849
01:37:42,885 --> 01:37:45,718
She showed him
it was all right to live again.

850
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:52,919
And the kidnappers
took that away, huh?

851
01:37:53,029 --> 01:37:56,988
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

852
01:37:58,567 --> 01:38:01,764
A man can be an artist...

853
01:38:04,673 --> 01:38:07,301
in anything... food, whatever.

854
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:11,972
It depends on how good he is at it.

855
01:38:15,384 --> 01:38:17,284
Creasy's art is death.

856
01:38:20,156 --> 01:38:23,956
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

857
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:33,801
I don't have anything else to say.

858
01:40:02,424 --> 01:40:05,052
Shh. Shh.

859
01:40:23,612 --> 01:40:25,944
Forgiveness is between them and God.

860
01:40:26,048 --> 01:40:28,949
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

861
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:28,031
Don't move.
Put your hands down. Put 'em down.

862
01:42:36,745 --> 01:42:39,373
<i>Señor John W. Creasy...</i>

863
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:42,973
<i>is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police.</i>

864
01:42:45,087 --> 01:42:48,181
<i>He's suspected
of possible involvement...</i>

865
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:51,748
<i>of possible involvement in
the kidnapping of Lupita Ramos.</i>

866
01:43:21,757 --> 01:43:24,555
Can you hear me? Huh?

867
01:43:26,195 --> 01:43:28,163
Know where we are?

868
01:43:29,398 --> 01:43:33,767
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad.

869
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:38,636
The ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?

870
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:41,403
<i>- Have you heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.</i>

871
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:43,410
<i>- Do you know what it is?
- Yes.</i>

872
01:43:43,512 --> 01:43:45,639
<i>I'm the president of La Hermandad.</i>

873
01:43:45,748 --> 01:43:47,443
- You're the president?
- Yes.

874
01:43:47,549 --> 01:43:49,642
<i>The president? Wow.</i>

875
01:43:49,752 --> 01:43:51,811
Look at me.

876
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,488
Oh, you can't.
I'm sorry.

877
01:43:55,591 --> 01:43:57,650
How's that?

878
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:08,169
Let me show you what I got here.

879
01:44:10,105 --> 01:44:13,632
See this? This is a charger. It's used
by convicts to hide money and drugs.

880
01:44:13,742 --> 01:44:17,439
They stick it in their body.
They tuck it up their rectum.

881
01:44:17,546 --> 01:44:20,777
You familiar with that?
This... Look at me.

882
01:44:20,883 --> 01:44:23,647
Pencil detonator.

883
01:44:23,752 --> 01:44:27,483
Timer, used as a receiver-transmitter.

884
01:44:27,589 --> 01:44:30,615
C-4. Highly explosive.

885
01:44:30,726 --> 01:44:32,956
You put 'em all together,
you got a bomb.

886
01:44:33,061 --> 01:44:35,621
Not very sophisticated,
but very powerful.

887
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:40,461
That's what you have in your ass right now.

888
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:43,936
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

889
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:50,678
Cheap watch. Pager watch.

890
01:44:50,779 --> 01:44:56,411
Used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

891
01:44:56,518 --> 01:44:59,715
<i>So, I'm gonna send you a page...</i>

892
01:44:59,822 --> 01:45:01,722
which you will receive...

893
01:45:04,893 --> 01:45:07,384
in five minutes.

894
01:45:07,496 --> 01:45:09,726
Now.

895
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,970
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down...

896
01:45:17,072 --> 01:45:20,200
between your men and the kidnapper.

897
01:45:20,309 --> 01:45:22,140
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

898
01:45:22,244 --> 01:45:24,872
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

899
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:28,677
<i>You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.</i>

900
01:45:30,819 --> 01:45:32,810
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
Are you sure?

901
01:45:35,657 --> 01:45:38,524
Okay.

902
01:45:38,627 --> 01:45:41,858
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

903
01:45:41,964 --> 01:45:44,728
- Hey, relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

904
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:47,700
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

905
01:45:47,803 --> 01:45:50,567
I saw the opportunity,
and I got lucky.

906
01:45:50,672 --> 01:45:52,162
And?

907
01:45:52,274 --> 01:45:55,368
And I had my men ready as we
got instructions where to go.

908
01:45:55,477 --> 01:45:57,411
You had your men ready
to steal the drop.

909
01:45:57,513 --> 01:45:59,947
<i>You had your men ready to kill
one of the kidnappers, yeah?</i>

910
01:46:00,048 --> 01:46:02,573
<i>You've done this many times.</i>

911
01:46:04,486 --> 01:46:07,785
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper...
- Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

912
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:10,950
- Bingo, yeah. You've done this
many times, huh?
- Many times, yeah.

913
01:46:11,059 --> 01:46:14,392
- Yeah. Killed many victims too, haven't you?
- Come on, sir.

914
01:46:14,496 --> 01:46:17,465
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

915
01:46:20,536 --> 01:46:23,630
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

916
01:46:25,107 --> 01:46:28,372
Wait-Wait a minute. Come on.

917
01:46:28,477 --> 01:46:30,741
<i>- I have a little gift for you.
- For me?</i>

918
01:46:30,846 --> 01:46:33,644
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
- What do you got?

919
01:46:33,749 --> 01:46:37,879
<i>There was no $10 million.
There was one half in the bags.</i>

920
01:46:37,986 --> 01:46:40,716
The ransom was $10 million?
They put it in two bags.

921
01:46:40,822 --> 01:46:42,949
- Five million in each bag, right?
- Two bags, true.

922
01:46:43,058 --> 01:46:46,585
<i>But one has half paper...</i>

923
01:46:46,695 --> 01:46:49,789
<i>the other only paper.</i>

924
01:46:49,898 --> 01:46:53,800
Maybe your men stole it.

925
01:46:53,902 --> 01:46:56,393
Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

926
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,409
Okay. At the Ramos house...

927
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:06,140
before the exchange,
who put the bags in the car?

928
01:47:06,248 --> 01:47:08,512
- Guess what.
- What?

929
01:47:08,617 --> 01:47:11,916
Ramos lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

930
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:14,488
- Jordan Kalfus?
- Yeah.

931
01:47:17,125 --> 01:47:19,593
Pedro.

932
01:47:26,868 --> 01:47:29,359
Sir? Please.

933
01:47:29,471 --> 01:47:32,167
I-I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry for the girl.

934
01:47:32,274 --> 01:47:36,267
It was just business.
You know, I'm a professional.

935
01:47:36,378 --> 01:47:39,677
That's what everybody keeps saying.
"I'm just a professional."

936
01:47:39,781 --> 01:47:42,579
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
"I'm just a professional. I'm just a professional."

937
01:47:42,684 --> 01:47:45,710
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that.
You understand me?

938
01:47:49,124 --> 01:47:52,059
What are you going to do now?

939
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,287
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna leave. I gotta go.

940
01:47:54,396 --> 01:47:57,559
- Yeah. I got...
- Come on. Come on. What about me, huh?

941
01:47:57,666 --> 01:48:00,635
- What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on.

942
01:48:00,736 --> 01:48:05,173
- Thirty-five.
- A last wish, please. Please.

943
01:48:05,273 --> 01:48:10,506
Last wish?
I wish you had more time.

944
01:48:10,612 --> 01:48:14,708
Hey! Hey, hey!

945
01:50:17,205 --> 01:50:20,834
Hola.

946
01:50:20,942 --> 01:50:23,570
<i>- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?</i>

947
01:50:23,678 --> 01:50:26,340
Listen, I got something
that looks like banking codes...

948
01:50:26,448 --> 01:50:28,313
from Bank Coast in the Cayman Islands.

949
01:50:28,416 --> 01:50:31,544
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

950
01:50:31,653 --> 01:50:35,749
<i>Jordan Kalfus, and it looks like
U.S. Deposits and withdrawals.</i>

951
01:50:35,857 --> 01:50:37,791
<i>Give me the same thing
on Samuel Ramos.</i>

952
01:50:37,893 --> 01:50:41,624
Samuel Ramos. That's it?

953
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:43,459
- That's it.
- Okay.

954
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,600
<i>Gracias.</i>

955
01:51:29,044 --> 01:51:32,673
- Creasy.
- Samuel.

956
01:51:32,781 --> 01:51:34,772
<i>Honey?</i>

957
01:51:38,386 --> 01:51:40,752
What's going on?

958
01:51:42,557 --> 01:51:46,584
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on?

959
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:51,931
<i>Huh, Sam?</i>

960
01:51:52,033 --> 01:51:54,263
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple
of questions, okay?

961
01:51:54,369 --> 01:51:57,304
You move...

962
01:51:57,405 --> 01:51:59,430
<i>you make one sound...</i>

963
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:02,635
I'll snatch the life right outta you,
you understand?

964
01:52:09,951 --> 01:52:12,647
What happened, Lisa, hmm?

965
01:52:12,754 --> 01:52:14,654
Were you in on this?

966
01:52:14,756 --> 01:52:18,920
- Or was it just your husband, huh?
- Am I in on what?

967
01:52:19,027 --> 01:52:22,554
You know what I'm talking about... Pita's
kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?

968
01:52:22,664 --> 01:52:25,963
- Pita got killed because the ransom got stolen.
- Shut up!

969
01:52:27,502 --> 01:52:29,868
Yeah, the money was stolen.
You're right. He's right.

970
01:52:29,971 --> 01:52:33,498
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen though, huh?

971
01:52:33,608 --> 01:52:36,600
- $2.5 million, right?
- What are you talking about?

972
01:52:36,711 --> 01:52:39,839
He knows what I'm talking about.
$2.5 million. That's what Victor got, isn't it?

973
01:52:39,948 --> 01:52:42,940
- What are you talking about?
- 2.5 million.

974
01:52:43,051 --> 01:52:45,349
<i>2.5 million to your lawyer
Jordan Kalfus...</i>

975
01:52:45,453 --> 01:52:48,581
that he put in an account in the Cayman
Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

976
01:52:51,927 --> 01:52:54,259
What happened to the other five, Sam?

977
01:52:54,362 --> 01:52:57,297
<i>Huh? That's 2.5, 2.5.
What is five from 10?</i>

978
01:52:57,399 --> 01:52:59,924
That's five. What happened
to the other five, Sam? Tell your wife.

979
01:53:00,035 --> 01:53:02,469
<i>- It's your chance to talk.
What happened to the other five?</i>

980
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:03,935
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't have a wife.

981
01:53:04,039 --> 01:53:06,803
Then you'll never know how hard
it could be to tell your wife the truth.

982
01:53:06,908 --> 01:53:09,138
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

983
01:53:09,244 --> 01:53:11,371
It was in this room
that my father prayed.

984
01:53:11,479 --> 01:53:14,175
- I don't give a fuck about your fucking father!
- My father prayed.

985
01:53:14,282 --> 01:53:18,184
<i>He prayed that his gambling
debts and his infidelities would
be forgiven right in this room.</i>

986
01:53:18,286 --> 01:53:20,982
<i>- Samuel! I love you!
- What, Lisa?</i>

987
01:53:21,089 --> 01:53:24,889
<i>- Tell me the truth.
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!</i>

988
01:53:24,993 --> 01:53:27,894
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess.

989
01:53:27,996 --> 01:53:30,897
- I inherited his lawyer Jordan...
- You tell me what happened to my baby!

990
01:53:30,999 --> 01:53:33,559
Say it! Say it! Say it!

991
01:53:33,668 --> 01:53:36,296
Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!

992
01:53:40,108 --> 01:53:42,542
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room...

993
01:53:42,644 --> 01:53:45,044
and watch cartoons all day...

994
01:53:45,146 --> 01:53:48,013
and she'd eat ice cream
and we'd have her back in two days.

995
01:53:48,116 --> 01:53:50,710
He lied to me!

996
01:53:50,819 --> 01:53:53,686
That's why he's fucking dead!
I did it!

997
01:53:53,788 --> 01:53:55,847
I did it, Lisa!

998
01:53:55,957 --> 01:53:58,687
I agreed to the kidnapping.

999
01:53:58,793 --> 01:54:02,229
I did it for us...
for the three of us.

1000
01:54:10,672 --> 01:54:12,799
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1001
01:54:18,813 --> 01:54:20,781
You kill him.

1002
01:54:22,183 --> 01:54:24,083
You kill him or I will.

1003
01:54:54,449 --> 01:54:56,417
Huh. You know, they say a, um...

1004
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:01,948
<i>a bullet always tells the truth.</i>

1005
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,200
It never lies.

1006
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:30,447
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe...

1007
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,280
Maybe it'll work for you.

1008
01:55:44,599 --> 01:55:47,193
<i>I'll pray for you.</i>

1009
01:58:49,651 --> 01:58:51,551
<i>Gracias.</i>

1010
01:59:16,344 --> 01:59:18,244
- ¿Hola?
- Hola.

1011
01:59:18,346 --> 01:59:20,837
<i>- Mr. Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

1012
01:59:20,948 --> 01:59:25,009

1013
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:28,577
<i>The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,

<i>Good. Thank you.</i>

<i>Huh? You wanna negotiate?</i>

1039

<i>Do you agree?</i>

And there you are.
You have my family.

1043
02:06:24,605 --> 02:06:27,472
Well, most of my family.

<i>My wife and I are separated.

Ah.

Your brother wants to speak to you.
Yeah, hold on.

<i>Whose life, Daniel? I want you.</i>

I will give you her life for your life.

1058
02:08:06,974 --> 02:08:11,434
And in exchange,
I will get my life back.

1059
02:08:11,545 --> 02:08:15,538
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1060
02:08:19,453 --> 02:08:23,617
- Pita's dead.
- Creasy!

1061

<i> I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.</i>

All right.

1063
02:08:37,271 --> 02:08:39,466
I want proof of life. You hear me?

1064
02:08:39,573 --> 02:08:42,542
I want proof of life.
I want... I want...

1065
02:08:42,643 --> 02:08:45,077
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1066
02:08:45,179 --> 02:08:47,807
<i>You tell her to tell you...</i>

1067
02:08:47,915 --> 02:08:51,442

1074
02:10:38,692 --> 02:10:40,592
Hello?

1075
02:10:40,694 --> 02:10:43,356
Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1076
02:10:43,464 --> 02:10:45,659
I think Pita's alive.

1077
02:10:47,468 --> 02:10:49,698
I can't take this anymore.

1078
02:10:49,803 --> 02:10:51,737
Take the road to Puebla.

1079
02:10:51,839 --> 02:10:54,706
Get off junction 34, south side.

1080
02:10:54,808 --> 02:10:56,833
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1081
02:11:42,156 --> 02:11:44,056
So where is she?

1082
02:11:46,593 --> 02:11:49,721
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1083
02:11:55,035 --> 02:11:58,300
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1084
02:11:58,405 --> 02:12:01,738
this is his brother.

1085
02:12:03,110 --> 02:12:05,237
Here.

1086
02:12:05,345 --> 02:12:09,076
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

1087
02:12:09,183 --> 02:12:11,947
<i>If anything goes wrong,
you put it to his head.</i>

1088
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,647
You pull the trigger, all right?

1089
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:19,215
You understand?

1090
02:12:22,296 --> 02:12:24,662
You don't...

1091
02:12:24,765 --> 02:12:28,030
Let him loose until she's with you.

1092
02:12:28,135 --> 02:12:30,103
You got it?

1093
02:12:32,573 --> 02:12:35,235
And you don't wait for me, okay?

1094
02:12:37,978 --> 02:12:39,707
Yeah.

1095
02:12:39,813 --> 02:12:43,374
- You'll be all right. You okay?
- Yeah.

1096
02:14:28,555 --> 02:14:30,455
Creasy!

1097
02:14:32,226 --> 02:14:34,194
Creasy!

1098
02:14:35,362 --> 02:14:37,830
Creasy!

1099
02:14:54,114 --> 02:14:56,514
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1100
02:14:56,617 --> 02:14:59,313
They didn't hurt you?

1101
02:14:59,419 --> 02:15:01,751
Hi.

1102
02:15:04,491 --> 02:15:08,791
Your mother's waitin' for you. She's right
down there at the end of the bridge.

1103
02:15:08,895 --> 02:15:12,524
- Okay? You go home.
- Okay.

1104
02:15:12,633 --> 02:15:15,363
- All right.
- Where are you goin'?

1105
02:15:19,239 --> 02:15:21,707
I'm goin' home too.

1106
02:15:22,743 --> 02:15:24,643
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

1107
02:15:28,915 --> 02:15:31,543
Oh, Hey.

1108
02:15:31,652 --> 02:15:34,985
I got something for you.

1109
02:15:37,057 --> 02:15:39,048
I got the last number too.

1110
02:15:39,159 --> 02:15:41,992
I love you, Creasy.

1111
02:15:44,498 --> 02:15:47,160
And you love me, don't you?

1112
02:15:48,268 --> 02:15:50,361
Yes, I do.

1113
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:53,667
With all my heart. Pita, go.

1114
02:15:53,774 --> 02:15:55,742
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

1115
02:16:09,289 --> 02:16:11,189
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

1116
02:16:11,291 --> 02:16:14,556
- Pita! Baby, come here. It's okay.
- Mom!

1117
02:16:14,661 --> 02:16:17,858
<i>- Mom!
- Come on! Okay, I'll let you go now.</i>

1118
02:16:17,964 --> 02:16:20,023
<i>Mom!</i>
