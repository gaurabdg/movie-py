1
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,930
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

2
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,140
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,850
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,560
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,930
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,790
No! No!

7
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,960
Gandalf!

8
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,270
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,780
No!

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,810
Gandalf!

11
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,320
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,560
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,230
Nothing.

14
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,630
Just a dream.

15
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,980
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,380
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,360
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,410
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,740
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,150
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,560
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,790
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,230
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,370
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,240
You never know.

27
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,640
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,280
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,540
It is special.

30
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,330
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,060
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,020
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,670
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,310
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,610
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,750
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,820
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,440
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,810
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,310
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,720
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,820
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,760
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,070
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,170
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,520
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,090
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,440
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,230
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,170
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,880
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,600
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,770
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,130
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,280
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,310
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,410
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,150
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,760
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,120
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,230
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,500
I can smell it.

63
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,210
We're not alone.

64
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,950
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,090
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
Where is it?

68
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,700
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,070
My precious.

70
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,210
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,480
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,300
This is Sting.

73
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,030
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,700
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,240
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,100
It burns!

77
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,570
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,510
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,580
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,410
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,090
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,850
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,620
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,500
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,230
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,070
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,420
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,420
Take it off us.

89
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,460
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,560
We swears.

91
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,300
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,740
We swears...

93
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,710
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,680
We will swear on...

95
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,820
...on the precious.

96
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,180
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,490
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,660
Yes...

99
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,720
...on the precious.

100
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,530
On the precious.

101
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,190
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,700
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,610
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,840
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,790
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,460
You've been there before?

107
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,060
Yes.

108
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,580
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,030
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,000
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,470
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,100
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,240
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,280
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,590
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,360
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,000
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,400
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,100
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,870
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,170
Follow me!

122
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,390
Merry!

123
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,850
Merry!

124
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,200
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,210
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,640
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,740
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,690
Merry!

130
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,190
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,530
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,630
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,340
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,210
Stop it!

135
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,050
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,280
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,260
You want some?

138
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,370
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,800
Merry.

140
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,200
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,440
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,140
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,650
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,380
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,660
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,170
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,400
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,940
Let's move!

150
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,060
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,040
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,970
Hurry!

153
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,370
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,480
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,620
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,780
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,420
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,130
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,590
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,690
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,170
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,940
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,420
Rohan.

164
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,390
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,160
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,300
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,440
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,550
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,280
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,420
Saruman.

172
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,030
The world is changing.

173
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,800
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

174
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,240
...and Mordor?

175
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,550
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

176
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,350
...and the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,830
Together, my Lord Sauron...

178
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,530
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,850
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

180
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,690
The forests will fall.

181
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,460
A new order will rise.

182
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,440
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

183
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,560
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,290
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,090
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,290
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,590
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,600
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,240
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,010
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,010
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,170
Swear it.

193
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,430
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,530
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,230
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,840
Murderers!

197
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,870
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,840
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,180
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.

200
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,250
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,520
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

202
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,490
But no more.

203
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,930
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,770
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,800
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,640
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,800
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,510
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,690
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,580
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,190
Quickly!

212
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,160
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,010
Rohan, my lord...

214
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,190
...is ready to fall.

215
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,960
Theodred.

216
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,800
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,250
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,990
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,610
He's alive.

220
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,530
Theodred.

221
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,910
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,820
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,990
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,860
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,940
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,600
Grima.

227
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,950
Grima.

228
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,010
Grima.

229
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,850
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,850
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,430
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,040
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,680
Can you not see?

234
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,910
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,610
...your warmongering.

236
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,790
Warmongering?

237
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,120
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,330
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,230
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,350
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,510
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,900
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,230
Too much.

244
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,370
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,340
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,110
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,750
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,120
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,450
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,720
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,960
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,890
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,050
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,220
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,730
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,360
Merry!

258
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,070
Merry!

259
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,970
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,620
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,660
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,450
What?

263
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,630
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,290
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,000
...and come alive.

266
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,940
Alive?

267
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,500
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,980
...talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,010
...even move.

270
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,850
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,080
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,720
Yeah!

273
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,190
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,760
What about them?

275
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,840
They're fresh.

276
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,270
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,220
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,720
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,350
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,060
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,360
Alive?

282
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,600
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,380
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,570
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,320
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,920
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,760
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,120
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,500
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,370
Pippin.

291
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,240
Let's go.

292
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,180
Go on.

293
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,850
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,320
Squeal.

295
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,690
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,340
Pippin!

297
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,090
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,540
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,600
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,480
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,610
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,670
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,680
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,390
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,190
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,290
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,910
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,440
This is Gimli, son of Gloin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,850
We are friends of Rohan
and of Theoden, your king.

310
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,320
Theoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,760
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,240
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,340
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,300
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,610
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,680
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,880
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,550
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,960
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,060
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,700
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,970
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,300
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,440
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,770
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,350
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,050
Dead?

329
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,760
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,640
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,110
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,970
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,420
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,090
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,360
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,010
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,830
We failed them.

339
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,580
And the other.

341
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,960
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,230
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,220
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,800
They ran over here.

345
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,640
They were followed.

346
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,580
The belt!

347
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,610
Run!

348
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,660
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,630
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,970
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,760
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,510
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,640
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,860
Come here!

355
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,940
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,020
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,440
Merry!

358
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,290
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,960
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,080
Little Orcs.

361
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,580
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
Tree?

363
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,810
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,220
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,920
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,430
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,960
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,930
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,370
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,510
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,740
Side?

372
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,810
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,520
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,950
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,730
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,190
Hobbits?

377
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,300
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,000
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,370
They come with fire.

380
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,140
They come with axes.

381
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,150
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,150
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,190
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,190
Halflings!

385
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,490
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,000
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,930
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,940
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,680
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,700
Saruman.

391
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,950
See? See?

392
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
We've led you out.

393
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,260
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,860
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,270
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,450
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,250
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,720
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,490
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,370
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,240
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,940
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,210
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,850
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,120
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,590
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,030
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,630
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:09,100
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,570
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,040
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,520
Here.

413
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,720
What does it eats?

414
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,870
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,770
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,710
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,440
We must starve!

418
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,990
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,020
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,030
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,000
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,470
Not like master.

423
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,930
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,980
Master knows.

425
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,410
Yes.

426
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,210
Precious.

427
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,420
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,460
...it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,290
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,660
There are dead things!

431
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,600
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,400
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,680
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,510
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,050
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,990
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,420
This way.

438
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,360
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,970
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,270
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,990
Frodo!

442
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,150
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,190
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,220
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,060
So bright.

446
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,060
So beautiful.

447
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,060
Our precious.

448
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,060
What did you say?

449
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,460
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,700
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,940
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,600
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,580
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,850
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

455
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,580
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,320
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

457
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,490
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,430
Were you?

459
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,870
Smeagol.

460
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,100
What did you call me?

461
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,210
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,150
A long time ago.

463
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,150
My name.

464
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,710
My name.

465
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,120
Smeagol.

466
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,860
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,370
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,250
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,050
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,490
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,600
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,850
Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,250
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,300
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,030
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,300
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,740
I'm here.

478
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,290
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,770
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,510
Orc blood.

481
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,290
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,580
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,160
This forest is old.

484
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,960
Very old.

485
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,000
Full of memory...

486
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,940
...and anger.

487
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,020
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,680
Gimli!

489
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,790
Lower your ax.

490
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,360
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,890
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,800
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,670
Talking trees.

494
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,330
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,740
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,130
The White Wizard approaches.

497
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,600
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

498
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,450
We must be quick.

499
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,660
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

500
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,670
Where are they?

501
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,400
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

502
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,840
They met someone they did not expect.

503
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,140
Does that comfort you?

504
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,280
Who are you?

505
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,720
Show yourself!

506
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,620
It cannot be.

507
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,560
Forgive me.

508
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,140
I mistook you for Saruman.

509
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,670
I am Saruman.

510
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,080
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

511
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,540
You fell.

512
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,550
Through fire...

513
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,020
...and water.

514
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,020
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

515
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,960
...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

516
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,510
Until at last I threw down
my enemy...

517
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,150
...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

518
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,720
Darkness took me...

519
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,560
...and I strayed out of thought
and time.

520
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,400
Stars wheeled overhead...

521
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,140
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

522
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,410
But it was not the end.

523
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,490
I felt life in me again.

524
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,950
I've been sent back...

525
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,680
...until my task is done.

526
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,030
Gandalf.

527
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,690
Gandalf?

528
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,900
Yes.

529
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,470
That was what they used to call me.

530
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,600
Gandalf the Grey.

531
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,710
That was my name.

532
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,310
Gandalf.

533
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,340
I am Gandalf the White.

534
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,450
And I come back to you now...

535
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,120
...at the turn of the tide.

536
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,200
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

537
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,130
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

538
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,100
That is no short distance!

539
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,570
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

540
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,840
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

541
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,450
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

542
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,610
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

543
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,010
...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?

544
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,790
I mean, charming...

545
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,690
...quite charming forest.

546
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,890
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

547
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,440
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

548
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,040
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

549
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,540
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

550
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,710
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

551
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,480
You still speak in riddles.

552
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,730
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

553
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,530
The Ents are going to wake up...

554
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,560
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

555
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,500
Oh, that's good.

556
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,370
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

557
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,710
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

558
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,540
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

559
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,450
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

560
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,140
That is one of the Mearas...

561
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,110
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

562
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,000
Shadowfax.

563
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,200
He is the lord of all horses...

564
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,740
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

565
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,590
O rowan mine

566
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,560
I saw you shine

567
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,260
Upon a summer's day

568
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,830
Upon your head
How golden-red

569
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:41,740
The crown you bore aloft

570
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,310
Such a beautiful verse.

571
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,390
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

572
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,820
You might call it far, perhaps.

573
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,530
My home lies deep in the forest...

574
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,630
...near the roots of the mountain.

575
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,630
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

576
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,830
And safe is where I'll keep you.

577
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,450
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

578
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,840
It's one of my own compositions.

579
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,210
Right.

580
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:26,520
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

581
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,560
And the dreams of trees unfold

582
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:38,190
When woodland halls are green and cool

583
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:42,470
And the wind is in the West

584
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,570
Come back to me

585
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:50,570
Come back to me

586
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:57,180
And say my land is best

587
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:08,300
Sleep, little Shirelings.

588
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,060
Heed no nightly noise.

589
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,140
Sleep till morning light.

590
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,940
I have business in the forest.

591
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,640
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

592
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:33,550
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

593
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:39,570
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

594
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:53,240
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

595
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,640
Sauron will suffer no rival.

596
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,350
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

597
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,960
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

598
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,960
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

599
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,690
The rumor has reached him.

600
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,830
The heir of Numenor still lives.

601
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,640
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

602
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,140
He fears what you may become.

603
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,810
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

604
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,610
He will use his puppet Saruman
to destroy Rohan.

605
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,280
War is coming.

606
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:35,010
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

607
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,620
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

608
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,490
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

609
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,760
His hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.

610
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,630
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

611
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,600
But for all their cunning...

612
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,330
...we have one advantage.

613
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,040
The Ring remains hidden.

614
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,050
And that we should seek to destroy it...

615
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,190
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

616
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,090
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

617
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,750
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

618
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:16,020
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

619
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,830
We must trust now in Frodo.

620
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,830
Everything depends upon speed...

621
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
...and the secrecy of his quest.

622
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,280
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

623
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,910
Frodo must finish this task alone.

624
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,980
He's not alone.

625
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,850
Sam went with him.

626
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,710
Did he?

627
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:44,520
Did he, indeed? Good.

628
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,560
Yes, very good.

629
01:02:55,570 --> 01:03:00,440
The Black Gate of Mordor.

630
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,740
Oh, save us.

631
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,750
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

632
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:21,450
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

633
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,070
So good Smeagol does,
master says so.

634
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,460
I did.

635
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,240
That's it, then.

636
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,080
We can't get past that.

637
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,630
Look!

638
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,260
The gate.

639
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,630
It's opening!

640
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,030
I can see a way down.

641
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,870
Sam, no!

642
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,410
Master!

643
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,800
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

644
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,740
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

645
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,010
- Now!
- No!

646
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,570
No! No, master!

647
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,740
They catch you! They catch you!

648
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,580
Don't take it to him.

649
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,250
He wants the precious.

650
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:37,450
Always he is looking for it.

651
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,530
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

652
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:45,670
But we mustn't let him have it.

653
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,170
No! There's another way.

654
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,010
More secret. A dark way.

655
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,980
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

656
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,540
He's up to something.

657
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,750
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

658
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,650
Yes. There's a path...

659
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,320
...and some stairs.

660
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,190
And then...

661
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,700
...a tunnel.

662
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,480
He's led us this far, Sam.

663
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,050
Mr. Frodo, no.

664
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,660
He's been true to his word.

665
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,720
No.

666
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,490
Lead the way, Smeagol.

667
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:51,040
Good Smeagol always helps.

668
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,030
Hello?

669
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,500
Treebeard?

670
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,540
Where has he gone?

671
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,150
I had the loveliest dream last night.

672
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,480
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

673
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,140
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

674
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,590
...you were sick.

675
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:48,020
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

676
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,470
Did you hear that?

677
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,010
There it is again.

678
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:07,540
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

679
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,250
You just said something... Treeish.

680
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:18,420
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

681
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,830
You're taller.

682
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,860
- Who?
- You!

683
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,660
- Than what?
- Than me!

684
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,300
I've always been taller than you.

685
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,100
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

686
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:41,470
Please, Merry.

687
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:45,480
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

688
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,890
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

689
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,290
3'8"!

690
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,060
Three-foot-eight.

691
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,030
You did something.

692
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,430
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

693
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,830
Merry!

694
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,340
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

695
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,420
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

696
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,750
Give me it back. Merry!

697
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,950
What's happening?!

698
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,290
It's got my leg!

699
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,120
Merry!

700
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,110
Help!

701
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,720
Away with you.

702
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,690
You should not be waking.

703
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,130
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

704
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,290
Go to sleep.

705
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,500
Away with you.

706
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,970
Come, the forest is waking up.

707
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,480
It isn't safe.

708
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,050
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

709
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,250
Anger festers in their hearts.

710
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,720
Black are their thoughts.

711
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,420
Strong is their hate.

712
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,360
They will harm you if they can.

713
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:38,090
There are too few of us now.

714
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:42,260
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

715
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,530
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

716
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:48,900
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

717
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:54,710
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

718
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,120
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

719
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

720
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,890
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

721
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,290
We lost them.

722
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:14,530
And now we cannot find them.

723
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:20,940
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

724
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,670
Can't say that I have.

725
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,240
You, Pip?

726
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,080
What do they look like?

727
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,190
I don't remember now.

728
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:57,510
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

729
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,910
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

730
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,520
...whose mind is overthrown.

731
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:08,950
Saruman's hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.

732
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:12,760
My lord, your son...

733
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,120
...he is dead.

734
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,430
My lord?

735
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,860
Uncle?

736
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,940
Will you not go to him?

737
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,450
Will you do nothing?

738
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,610
Be careful what you say.

739
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,950
Do not look for welcome here.

740
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:08,210
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

741
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,550
What a tragedy for the king...

742
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,720
...to lose his only son and heir.

743
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:19,350
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

744
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:24,430
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

745
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,070
Leave me alone, snake!

746
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,160
Oh, but you are alone.

747
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:35,570
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

748
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:39,180
...in the bitter watches of the night...

749
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:43,050
...when all your life seems to shrink.

750
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,420
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

751
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:52,150
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

752
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,300
So fair.

753
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:58,930
So cold.

754
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,930
Like a morning of pale spring...

755
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,580
...still clinging to winter's chill.

756
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,810
Your words are poison.

757
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,850
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

758
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,040
I cannot allow you before Theoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

759
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,100
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

760
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,190
Your staff.

761
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,090
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

762
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,790
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

763
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,660
He's a herald of woe.

764
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,270
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

765
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,810
...Theoden King.

766
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:28,040
He's not welcome.

767
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:34,280
Why should I welcome you...

768
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:38,450
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

769
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,920
A just question, my liege.

770
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,960
Late is the hour...

771
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:49,090
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

772
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,960
Lathspell I name him.

773
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,040
Ill news is an ill guest.

774
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:59,770
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

775
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,880
I have not passed
through fire and death...

776
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:05,280
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

777
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,380
His staff.

778
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:12,690
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

779
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:17,960
Theoden...

780
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:21,090
...son of Thengel...

781
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:25,240
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

782
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:31,470
I would stay still if I were you.

783
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,740
Hearken to me!

784
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,380
I release you...

785
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,520
...from the spell.

786
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:58,100
You have no power here...

787
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:01,900
...Gandalf the Grey.

788
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:12,380
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

789
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,320
Wait.

790
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,600
If I go, Theoden dies.

791
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,500
You did not kill me...

792
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,870
...you will not kill him.

793
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,470
Rohan is mine.

794
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,280
Be gone.

795
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,920
I know your face.

796
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,760
Eowyn.

797
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,330
Eowyn.

798
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,810
Gandalf?

799
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:51,220
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

800
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,190
Dark have been my dreams of late.

801
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,110
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

802
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,250
...if they grasped your sword.

803
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,350
I've only...

804
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,590
...ever served you, my lord.

805
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,760
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

806
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,700
Send me not from your sight.

807
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:21,740
No, my lord! No, my lord.

808
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,140
Let him go.

809
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:27,080
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

810
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:38,520
Get out of my way!

811
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,930
Hail, Theoden King!

812
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,080
Where is Theodred?

813
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,660
Where is my son?

814
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:45,580
Simbelmyne.

815
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:54,320
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

816
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:01,140
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

817
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:07,140
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

818
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:12,320
The young perish and the old linger.

819
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,010
That I should live...

820
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:18,550
...to see the last days of my house.

821
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:23,660
Theodred's death
was not of your making.

822
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:30,100
No parent should have to bury
their child.

823
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,680
He was strong in life.

824
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:53,350
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

825
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,870
They had no warning.

826
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,440
They were unarmed.

827
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:46,940
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

828
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,850
Rick, cot and tree.

829
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,380
Where is Mama?

830
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:57,380
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

831
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,960
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

832
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,550
Ride out and meet him head on.

833
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,790
Draw him away from your women
and children.

834
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,760
You must fight.

835
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,770
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

836
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,570
Eomer is loyal to you.

837
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,440
His men will return
and fight for their king.

838
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:25,520
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

839
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,420
Eomer cannot help us.

840
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,820
I know what it is you want of me...

841
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:37,260
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

842
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,630
I will not risk open war.

843
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:46,200
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

844
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,100
When last I looked...

845
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:56,170
...Theoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

846
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,320
Then what is the king's decision?

847
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,230
By order of the king...

848
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,870
...the city must empty.

849
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,900
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

850
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:22,110
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

851
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:23,800
Helm's Deep.

852
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:27,500
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

853
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,650
Who will defend them if not their king?

854
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:32,280
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

855
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,250
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

856
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:38,320
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

857
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,690
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

858
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,020
What they will get is a massacre.

859
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:47,060
Theoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

860
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,270
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

861
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,600
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

862
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:57,870
The people of Rohan will need you.

863
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,710
The defenses have to hold.

864
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,880
They will hold.

865
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:10,190
The Grey Pilgrim.

866
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,990
That's what they used to call me.

867
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:18,260
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

868
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,060
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

869
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,900
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

870
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:29,470
At dawn, look to the east.

871
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,200
Go.

872
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,840
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

873
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:42,970
His name is Brego.

874
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,390
He was my cousin's horse.

875
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,420
Brego.

876
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:05,570
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

877
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,040
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

878
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,510
You speak as one of their own.

879
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,750
I was raised in Rivendell...

880
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,540
...for a time.

881
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,880
Turn this fellow free.

882
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:27,020
He's seen enough of war.

883
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:41,640
Gandalf the White.

884
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:44,180
Gandalf the Fool!

885
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:49,510
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

886
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:54,690
There were three
who followed the wizard.

887
01:32:55,090 --> 01:33:00,430
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

888
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,590
You stink of horse.

889
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,740
The Man...

890
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:16,970
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

891
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:20,950
One of the Dunedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

892
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,910
His cloth was poor.

893
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:28,950
And yet he bore a strange ring.

894
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,590
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

895
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:39,600
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

896
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:41,670
The Ring of Barahir.

897
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,230
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

898
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:49,740
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

899
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:52,640
The line was broken years ago.

900
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,540
It matters not.

901
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,240
The world of Men shall fall.

902
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,290
It will begin at Edoras.

903
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,430
I am ready, Gamling.

904
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,070
Bring my horse.

905
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,600
This is not a defeat.

906
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,240
We will return.

907
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,080
We will return.

908
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,410
You have some skill with a blade.

909
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,010
Women of this country learned long ago:

910
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:08,820
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

911
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,820
I fear neither death nor pain.

912
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,190
What do you fear, my lady?

913
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,400
A cage.

914
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:24,540
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

915
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:28,610
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

916
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,070
You're a daughter of kings...

917
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:38,650
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

918
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:46,450
I do not think that would be your fate.

919
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:22,560
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

920
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,830
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

921
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,900
He will expect an attack on the city.

922
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:32,470
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

923
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,980
...the great fortress of Rohan.

924
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:40,580
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

925
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,750
They will be slow.

926
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,560
They will have women and children
with them.

927
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,690
Send out your Warg-riders.

928
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,480
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

929
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,310
- Why do you do that?
- What?

930
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:18,010
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

931
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,480
Because.

932
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:24,150
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

933
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:26,520
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

934
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,730
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

935
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,170
You have no idea what it did to him...

936
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,830
...what it's still doing to him.

937
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,140
I want to help him, Sam.

938
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:40,570
Why?

939
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,010
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

940
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,190
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

941
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,090
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

942
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,230
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

943
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,200
I do.

944
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,110
It's the Ring.

945
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,240
You can't take your eyes off it.

946
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,950
I've seen you.

947
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:24,250
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

948
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,250
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

949
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:31,120
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

950
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,230
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

951
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,130
Mine! My own!

952
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:39,100
Can't you hear yourself?

953
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,930
Don't you know who you sound like?

954
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,340
We wants it.

955
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,220
We needs it.

956
01:38:56,390 --> 01:39:01,190
Must have the precious.

957
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,800
They stole it from us.

958
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,330
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

959
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:12,400
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

960
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,840
No. Not master.

961
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:19,840
Yes, precious. False.

962
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:24,510
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

963
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:28,120
Master's my friend.

964
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:33,350
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

965
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:37,120
Not listening. I'm not listening.

966
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:41,290
You're a liar and a thief.

967
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,490
No.

968
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,310
Murderer.

969
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,800
Go away.

970
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:53,340
Go away?

971
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:58,150
I hate you.

972
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,720
I hate you.

973
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,320
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

974
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:06,320
I saved us.

975
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:11,020
It was me. We survived because of me.

976
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:15,830
Not anymore.

977
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:18,730
What did you say?

978
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:24,640
Master looks after us now.

979
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:28,300
We don't need you.

980
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,570
What?

981
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,510
Leave now...

982
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:36,490
...and never come back.

983
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,680
No.

984
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:42,390
Leave now and never come back.

985
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,900
Leave now and never come back!

986
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,580
We told him to go away.

987
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:08,720
And away he goes, precious.

988
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:10,880
Gone! Gone! Gone!

989
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,890
Smeagol is free!

990
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,250
Look.

991
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:23,930
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

992
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:34,880
They are young.

993
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:37,570
They are tender. They are nice.

994
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:41,280
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

995
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:45,580
You'll make him sick, you will...

996
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,990
...behaving like that.

997
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,160
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

998
01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:59,930
What's it doing?

999
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,300
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1000
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,670
It ruins it.

1001
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:09,480
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1002
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:16,180
What we need is a few good taters.

1003
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:20,120
What's taters, precious?

1004
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,020
What's taters? Eh?

1005
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,920
Po-ta-toes.

1006
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:27,500
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1007
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,500
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1008
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:37,710
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1009
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:40,240
Oh, yes, we could.

1010
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:43,910
Spoil a nice fish.

1011
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,820
Give it to us raw...

1012
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:51,020
...and wriggling.

1013
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:54,320
You keep nasty chips.

1014
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,320
You're hopeless.

1015
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,340
Mr. Frodo?

1016
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:31,890
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1017
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:34,530
Servants of Sauron.

1018
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:37,530
They are called to Mordor.

1019
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,730
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1020
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:44,070
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1021
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:49,310
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1022
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:54,650
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1023
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:57,980
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1024
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,390
Mr. Frodo.

1025
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,520
Look.

1026
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:07,470
It's an oliphaunt.

1027
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:18,670
No one at home will believe this.

1028
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:31,690
Smeagol?

1029
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:14,540
We've lingered here too long.

1030
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:18,870
Come on, Sam.

1031
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,050
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1032
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:41,860
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1033
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:44,930
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1034
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:49,670
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1035
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,900
The enemy?

1036
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:57,470
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1037
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,040
You wonder what his name is...

1038
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,820
...where he came from.

1039
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:10,230
And if he was really evil at heart.

1040
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:15,350
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1041
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:19,440
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1042
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,160
...in peace.

1043
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:29,840
War will make corpses of us all.

1044
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,960
Bind their hands.

1045
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,630
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1046
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,460
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1047
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,800
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1048
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:52,110
It's the beards.

1049
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:54,430
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1050
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:57,480
...that there are no Dwarf women...

1051
01:46:57,650 --> 01:47:01,910
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1052
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,450
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

1053
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,820
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1054
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,320
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1055
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:22,030
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1056
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,070
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1057
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,540
Cut down by Orcs.

1058
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:30,700
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1059
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:36,010
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1060
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:40,750
Doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father.

1061
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,100
Gimli.

1062
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,330
No, I couldn't

1063
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,330
I really couldn't.

1064
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,470
I made some stew.

1065
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,910
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1066
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,780
Thank you.

1067
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:39,830
- It's good.
- Really?

1068
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:47,180
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1069
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:52,550
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1070
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,420
But he must be mistaken.

1071
01:48:55,690 --> 01:49:00,100
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1072
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:04,430
Then you must be at least 60.

1073
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,090
Seventy?

1074
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,200
But you cannot be 80!

1075
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:14,910
Eighty-seven.

1076
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:20,110
You are one of the Dunedain.

1077
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,280
A descendant of Numenor,
blessed with long life.

1078
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:28,150
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1079
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:30,550
There are few of us left.

1080
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:33,560
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1081
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:37,730
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1082
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:56,510
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1083
01:49:57,290 --> 01:50:00,740
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1084
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,960
Like my heart.

1085
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:09,090
Go to sleep.

1086
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,750
I am asleep.

1087
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,170
This is a dream.

1088
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:25,610
Then it is a good dream.

1089
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:39,720
Sleep.

1090
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:44,590
Arwen...

1091
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:35,900
Where is she?

1092
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:39,510
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1093
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:45,570
Our time here is ending.

1094
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,810
Arwen's time is ending.

1095
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:50,810
Let her go.

1096
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:53,010
Let her take the ship into the west.

1097
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:56,250
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1098
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,220
There it will be ever green.

1099
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,090
But never more than memory.

1100
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,390
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1101
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:10,200
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1102
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:12,670
She belongs with her people.

1103
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,820
Why are you saying this?

1104
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:07,580
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1105
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:11,690
It was a dream, Arwen.

1106
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:13,490
Nothing more.

1107
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:18,090
I don't believe you.

1108
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,910
This belongs to you.

1109
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,270
It was a gift.

1110
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,440
Keep it.

1111
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:41,150
My lord?

1112
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:48,520
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1113
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,450
What is it?

1114
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,010
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1115
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,630
Wargs!

1116
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:49,850
A scout!

1117
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,690
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1118
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:02,230
Get them out of here!

1119
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,000
All riders to the head of the column.

1120
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:11,700
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1121
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,600
Come on!

1122
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:27,860
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1123
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:29,520
- I can fight.
- No!

1124
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:34,290
You must do this, for me.

1125
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,890
Follow me!

1126
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:45,700
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1127
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:48,570
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1128
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,080
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1129
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,440
That one counts as mine!

1130
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,760
Stinking creature.

1131
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,920
Aragorn!

1132
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:01,090
Aragorn?

1133
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:18,010
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1134
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:19,610
He's...

1135
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,770
...dead.

1136
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:25,310
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1137
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,220
You lie.

1138
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:05,750
Get the wounded on horses.

1139
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:10,220
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1140
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:12,750
Leave the dead.

1141
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,660
Come.

1142
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:33,440
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1143
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:36,520
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1144
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:40,890
We're safe!

1145
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:45,260
We're safe, my lady.

1146
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:46,620
Thank you.

1147
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:32,370
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1148
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:34,100
Freda!

1149
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:42,680
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1150
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:47,850
Take it to the caves.

1151
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,850
Make way for the king.

1152
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:55,690
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.

1153
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:07,330
So few. So few of you have returned.

1154
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:12,370
Our people are safe.

1155
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:16,270
We have paid for it with many lives.

1156
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:18,640
My lady.

1157
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:24,620
Lord Aragorn...

1158
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:26,020
...where is he?

1159
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:29,550
He fell.

1160
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:55,220
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1161
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:58,320
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1162
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,650
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

1163
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:04,420
Get them into the caves.

1164
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:10,160
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1165
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:15,600
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1166
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:18,100
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1167
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:21,370
...but for a small culvert
at its base...

1168
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:24,310
...which is little more than a drain.

1169
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:31,310
How? How can fire undo stone?

1170
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:36,050
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1171
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:43,650
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1172
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:47,360
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1173
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:50,100
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

1174
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:51,700
Tens of thousands.

1175
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:55,930
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1176
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:10,950
A new power is rising.

1177
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:14,120
Its victory is at hand.

1178
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,860
This night...

1179
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:26,630
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1180
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:30,140
March to Helm's Deep!

1181
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:33,800
Leave none alive!

1182
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:38,800
To war!

1183
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:47,180
There will be no dawn for Men.

1184
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:06,430
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1185
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:09,770
There is always smoke rising...

1186
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:13,810
...from Isengard these days.

1187
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:15,640
Isengard?

1188
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:17,720
There was a time...

1189
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:21,580
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1190
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,120
But now he has a mind of metal...

1191
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:28,230
...and wheels.

1192
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,490
He no longer cares for growing things.

1193
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:35,470
What is it?

1194
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:42,670
It's Saruman's army.

1195
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,400
The war has started.

1196
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:27,080
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1197
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,250
Brego.

1198
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:28,540
Arwen.

1199
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:40,190
I have made my choice.

1200
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:49,500
He is not coming back.

1201
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:54,270
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1202
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:58,160
There is still hope.

1203
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:06,080
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1204
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:12,450
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1205
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:15,110
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

1206
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:19,990
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1207
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:23,250
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1208
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:26,370
...Aragorn will die.

1209
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,760
And there will be no comfort
for you...

1210
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:36,170
...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1211
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:41,710
He will come to death...

1212
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:44,480
...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

1213
02:09:44,650 --> 02:09:49,320
...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1214
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:02,360
But you, my daughter...

1215
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:08,200
...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

1216
02:10:08,370 --> 02:10:12,440
...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1217
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:17,250
Here you will dwell...

1218
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:22,320
...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

1219
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:26,050
...until all the world is changed...

1220
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:30,720
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1221
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:40,430
Arwen.

1222
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,340
There is nothing for you here...

1223
02:10:50,010 --> 02:10:52,110
...only death.

1224
02:12:25,540 --> 02:12:29,170
The power of the enemy is growing.

1225
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,970
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

1226
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:35,580
...to destroy the people of Rohan.

1227
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:41,280
Isengard has been unleashed.

1228
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,960
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

1229
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:53,090
...the last free kingdom of Men.

1230
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:57,670
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1231
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:04,470
He senses the Ring is close.

1232
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:08,100
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

1233
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:12,340
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

1234
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:17,750
...the quest will claim his life.

1235
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,080
You know this.

1236
02:13:20,690 --> 02:13:23,520
You have foreseen it.

1237
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:29,090
It is the risk we all took.

1238
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:37,670
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1239
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:43,280
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

1240
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:48,910
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1241
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,680
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1242
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:56,950
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1243
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,190
It is close now.

1244
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:05,630
So close to achieving its goal.

1245
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:12,370
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1246
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:16,670
...even unto to the ending
of the world.

1247
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,340
The time of the Elves...

1248
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:22,480
...is over.

1249
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:26,910
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1250
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:32,120
Do we let them stand alone?

1251
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:38,100
What news?

1252
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:41,060
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1253
02:14:41,230 --> 02:14:44,100
Theoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1254
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:48,300
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1255
02:14:48,470 --> 02:14:50,880
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1256
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:53,340
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1257
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:56,910
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1258
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:01,580
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1259
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:04,810
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1260
02:15:06,930 --> 02:15:09,120
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1261
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:11,990
Sauron from Mordor.

1262
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:16,530
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1263
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:18,400
Gondor is weak.

1264
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:21,700
Sauron will strike us soon.

1265
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,310
And he will strike hard.

1266
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:28,840
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1267
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:44,990
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1268
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:47,890
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1269
02:15:48,070 --> 02:15:50,330
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1270
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:58,930
Speak.

1271
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,640
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1272
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:06,010
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1273
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:07,940
Your bodyguard?

1274
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:09,910
His gardener.

1275
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,510
And where is your skulking friend?

1276
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:16,320
That gangrel creature.

1277
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:18,630
He had an ill-favored look.

1278
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:22,260
There was no other.

1279
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:28,700
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1280
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:35,100
One we lost in Moria...

1281
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:37,700
...two were my kin...

1282
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:41,610
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1283
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:45,690
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1284
02:16:50,690 --> 02:16:52,450
You're a friend of Boromir?

1285
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,390
Yes.

1286
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:58,560
For my part.

1287
02:17:05,070 --> 02:17:08,010
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1288
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,510
Dead?

1289
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,740
How? When?

1290
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:16,640
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1291
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:20,780
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1292
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:29,990
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1293
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:33,290
It was cloven in two.

1294
02:17:34,970 --> 02:17:38,370
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1295
02:17:40,410 --> 02:17:42,200
He was my brother.

1296
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:34,110
Boromir!

1297
02:18:34,660 --> 02:18:36,520
Boromir!

1298
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:44,530
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1299
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:48,360
A place of light and beauty and music.

1300
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:50,870
And so it shall be once more!

1301
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:56,070
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1302
02:18:56,250 --> 02:19:00,610
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1303
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:10,080
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1304
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:12,430
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1305
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:15,430
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1306
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:26,900
Good speech. Nice and short.

1307
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:29,970
Leaves more time for drinking!

1308
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:34,540
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1309
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:40,150
Remember today, little brother.

1310
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:43,310
Today, life is good.

1311
02:19:47,490 --> 02:19:49,080
What?

1312
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:50,930
He's here.

1313
02:19:54,130 --> 02:19:55,970
One moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1314
02:19:56,140 --> 02:19:57,160
Where is he?

1315
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:00,790
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1316
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:03,070
Father!

1317
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:10,280
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1318
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:13,850
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1319
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,220
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1320
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,320
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1321
02:20:21,490 --> 02:20:23,520
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1322
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:25,390
Oh, too few.

1323
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:28,300
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1324
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,560
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1325
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:36,000
That is not my intent.

1326
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:39,940
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1327
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:46,210
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1328
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:49,150
...I know his uses, and they are few.

1329
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:52,910
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1330
02:20:54,090 --> 02:20:56,520
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1331
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:59,560
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1332
02:20:59,730 --> 02:21:03,530
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1333
02:21:05,740 --> 02:21:08,030
The One Ring.

1334
02:21:10,770 --> 02:21:15,440
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1335
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:19,240
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1336
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:23,540
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1337
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:28,020
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1338
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:31,890
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1339
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:36,020
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1340
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:41,500
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1341
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:46,730
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1342
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:48,400
He will return.

1343
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:52,310
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1344
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:55,040
You must go.

1345
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:58,310
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1346
02:21:59,150 --> 02:22:04,650
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1347
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:08,520
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1348
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:11,660
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?

1349
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:14,770
Oh, I see.

1350
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:19,130
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1351
02:22:19,570 --> 02:22:21,560
I think not.

1352
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:24,610
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1353
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:27,680
The one who will not fail me.

1354
02:22:44,830 --> 02:22:47,990
Remember today, little brother.

1355
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:08,340
Captain Faramir!

1356
02:23:09,620 --> 02:23:11,750
We found the third one.

1357
02:23:23,230 --> 02:23:25,220
You must come with me. Now.

1358
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:37,570
Down there.

1359
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:55,360
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1360
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:07,460
They wait for my command.

1361
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:14,040
Shall I shoot?

1362
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:18,310
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1363
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:20,320
So juicy sweet

1364
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:23,920
Our only wish
To catch a fish

1365
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:26,790
So juicy sweet

1366
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:35,200
Wait.

1367
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:39,540
This creature is bound to me.

1368
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,070
And I to him.

1369
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:46,640
He is our guide.

1370
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:52,780
Please...

1371
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:54,820
...let me go down to him.

1372
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,760
Smeagol.

1373
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:11,000
Master is here.

1374
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:13,330
Come, Smeagol.

1375
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:18,830
Trust master. Come.

1376
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:25,850
We must go now?

1377
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:29,650
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1378
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:31,220
Follow me. Come on.

1379
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,010
Come.

1380
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:37,720
Come, Smeagol.

1381
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:40,290
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1382
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,320
Come on.

1383
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:48,400
Don't hurt him!

1384
02:25:48,570 --> 02:25:51,300
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.

1385
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,770
Master!

1386
02:26:17,970 --> 02:26:20,330
That's enough.

1387
02:26:23,970 --> 02:26:26,130
Where are you leading them?

1388
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,600
Answer me.

1389
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:33,640
Smeagol.

1390
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:41,850
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1391
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,720
Cruel Men hurts us.

1392
02:26:45,890 --> 02:26:48,890
Master tricksed us.

1393
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:52,620
Of course he did.

1394
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,700
I told you he was tricksy.

1395
02:26:56,870 --> 02:26:59,900
I told you he was false.

1396
02:27:00,070 --> 02:27:02,770
Master is our friend.

1397
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:05,310
Our friend.

1398
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:07,640
Master betrayed us.

1399
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:10,810
No. Not its business.

1400
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:14,320
Leave us alone!

1401
02:27:14,490 --> 02:27:16,890
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1402
02:27:17,060 --> 02:27:19,350
They stole it from us!

1403
02:27:19,530 --> 02:27:20,960
No. No.

1404
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:23,150
What did they steal?

1405
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:30,630
My precious!

1406
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:35,970
We have to get out of here.

1407
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:38,540
You go. Go, now.

1408
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:43,010
You can do it.

1409
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:45,920
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1410
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,880
Just this once.

1411
02:27:48,050 --> 02:27:49,820
Put it on.

1412
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:52,280
Disappear.

1413
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:54,410
I can't.

1414
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:59,730
You were right, Sam.

1415
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:03,660
You tried to tell me but...

1416
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:10,530
I'm sorry.

1417
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:17,950
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1418
02:28:19,350 --> 02:28:21,010
If I put it on...

1419
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:23,520
...he'll find me.

1420
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:27,160
He'll see.

1421
02:28:28,390 --> 02:28:30,360
Mr. Frodo...

1422
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:39,560
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1423
02:28:41,770 --> 02:28:44,760
Here in the Wild I have you...

1424
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,840
...two Halflings...

1425
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:50,170
...and a host of men at my call.

1426
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:56,970
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1427
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:10,390
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1428
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,030
...to show his quality.

1429
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:37,750
No!

1430
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:42,260
Stop it!

1431
02:29:42,430 --> 02:29:43,490
Leave him alone.

1432
02:29:44,830 --> 02:29:47,320
Don't you understand?

1433
02:29:48,630 --> 02:29:50,530
He's got to destroy it!

1434
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:53,930
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1435
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:55,770
To the Mountain of Fire!

1436
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:59,940
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1437
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:03,100
Please. It's such a burden.

1438
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,380
Will you not help him?

1439
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:10,620
Captain?

1440
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:13,520
Prepare to leave.

1441
02:30:18,460 --> 02:30:20,900
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1442
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:36,530
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1443
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:39,760
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1444
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:43,710
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1445
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:47,900
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1446
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:50,070
Bless you, laddie.

1447
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:52,380
Gimli, where is the king?

1448
02:32:06,170 --> 02:32:07,500
You look terrible.

1449
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,300
A great host, you say?

1450
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:54,140
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1451
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:57,800
Ten thousand strong at least.

1452
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:00,780
Ten thousand?

1453
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:03,710
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1454
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:08,520
To destroy the world of Men.

1455
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:13,020
They will be here by nightfall.

1456
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:20,170
Let them come!

1457
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:24,430
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1458
02:33:24,610 --> 02:33:27,740
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1459
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:38,920
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1460
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:41,520
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1461
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:44,420
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1462
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:46,990
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1463
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:49,790
These are Uruk-hai.

1464
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:53,400
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1465
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:58,700
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1466
02:33:58,870 --> 02:34:02,470
I know how to defend my own keep.

1467
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:12,480
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1468
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:17,890
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1469
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:20,750
Crops can be resown...

1470
02:34:20,930 --> 02:34:23,920
...homes rebuilt.

1471
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:27,090
Within these walls...

1472
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:28,960
...we will outlast them.

1473
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:31,540
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1474
02:34:31,700 --> 02:34:33,260
They come to destroy its people...

1475
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:35,930
...down to the last child.

1476
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:39,070
What would you have me do?

1477
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:40,970
Look at my men.

1478
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:42,870
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1479
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:49,490
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1480
02:34:49,650 --> 02:34:52,680
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1481
02:34:56,330 --> 02:34:58,230
Send out riders, my lord.

1482
02:34:58,530 --> 02:35:01,400
You must call for aid.

1483
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:06,930
And who will come?

1484
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:08,930
Elves?

1485
02:35:09,110 --> 02:35:11,170
Dwarves?

1486
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:14,810
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1487
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:17,910
The old alliances are dead.

1488
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:21,150
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1489
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:23,510
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1490
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:27,720
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1491
02:35:27,890 --> 02:35:29,830
Where was Gon-?

1492
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:34,430
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1493
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:38,500
...we are alone.

1494
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:47,100
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1495
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,540
We need more time
to lay provisions-

1496
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:52,200
There is no time. War is upon us.

1497
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:54,180
Secure the gate.

1498
02:35:59,390 --> 02:36:01,480
We Ents have not troubled...

1499
02:36:01,690 --> 02:36:05,060
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1500
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:08,800
...for a very long time.

1501
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:14,830
But now, something
is about to happen...

1502
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,330
...that has not happened...

1503
02:36:17,540 --> 02:36:20,010
...for an age.

1504
02:36:21,210 --> 02:36:23,470
Entmoot.

1505
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:24,900
What's that?

1506
02:36:25,310 --> 02:36:28,150
'Tis a gathering.

1507
02:36:29,350 --> 02:36:31,910
A gathering of what?

1508
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:52,200
Beech. Oak.

1509
02:36:52,370 --> 02:36:54,270
Chestnut. Ash.

1510
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:56,510
Good. Good. Good.

1511
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:59,040
Many have come.

1512
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:09,350
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1513
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:12,080
...will go to war.

1514
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:24,090
Move back! Move to the caves!

1515
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:28,630
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1516
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,340
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1517
02:37:31,510 --> 02:37:33,810
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1518
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:37,110
Aragorn, you must rest.

1519
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:39,680
You're no use to us half alive.

1520
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:41,350
Aragorn!

1521
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:47,780
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1522
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:49,620
That is an honorable charge.

1523
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:52,660
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1524
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:54,530
What renown is there in that?

1525
02:37:54,700 --> 02:37:58,400
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1526
02:37:58,670 --> 02:38:01,470
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1527
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:06,630
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1528
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:09,740
You do not command
the others to stay!

1529
02:38:09,910 --> 02:38:13,680
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1530
02:38:14,850 --> 02:38:17,050
Because they love you.

1531
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,680
I'm sorry.

1532
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:34,890
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1533
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:37,760
These are no soldiers.

1534
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:43,490
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1535
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:50,340
Look at them. They're frightened.

1536
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:51,980
I can see it in their eyes.

1537
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:15,130
Then I shall die as one of them!

1538
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:23,400
Let him go, lad.

1539
02:40:23,970 --> 02:40:25,940
Let him be.

1540
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:32,870
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1541
02:40:37,150 --> 02:40:39,050
My lord?

1542
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:43,690
Who am I, Gamling?

1543
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:50,970
You are our king, sire.

1544
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:57,240
And do you trust your king?

1545
02:40:58,770 --> 02:41:01,940
Your men, my lord...

1546
02:41:02,110 --> 02:41:04,910
...will follow you to whatever end.

1547
02:41:11,790 --> 02:41:13,690
To whatever end.

1548
02:41:23,530 --> 02:41:27,090
Where is the horse and the rider?

1549
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:30,330
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1550
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:36,280
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1551
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:40,510
Like wind in the meadow.

1552
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:47,950
The days have gone down in the West...

1553
02:41:48,650 --> 02:41:51,280
...behind the hills...

1554
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:54,820
...into Shadow.

1555
02:42:03,270 --> 02:42:06,710
How did it come to this?

1556
02:42:27,990 --> 02:42:29,860
It's been going for hours.

1557
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,430
They must have decided something
by now.

1558
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:37,690
Decided? No.

1559
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:43,000
We only just finished saying...

1560
02:42:44,210 --> 02:42:46,070
...good morning.

1561
02:42:47,410 --> 02:42:50,610
But it's nighttime already.

1562
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:52,580
You can't take forever.

1563
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:55,640
Don't be hasty.

1564
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:58,490
We're running out of time!

1565
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:04,460
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1566
02:43:22,010 --> 02:43:23,340
Give me your sword.

1567
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:34,020
What is your name?

1568
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:36,920
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1569
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:41,690
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1570
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:45,630
They say that it is hopeless.

1571
02:44:03,450 --> 02:44:05,080
This is a good sword.

1572
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:09,450
Haleth, son of Hama...

1573
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:15,950
...there is always hope.

1574
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:42,280
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1575
02:44:42,450 --> 02:44:44,010
Forgive me.

1576
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:45,620
I was wrong to despair.

1577
02:44:54,830 --> 02:44:57,630
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1578
02:45:01,070 --> 02:45:03,130
It's a little tight across the chest.

1579
02:45:09,310 --> 02:45:11,280
That is no Orc horn.

1580
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,790
Send for the king.

1581
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:22,550
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1582
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:55,890
How is this possible?

1583
02:45:56,890 --> 02:46:00,520
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1584
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:03,930
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1585
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:08,870
Long ago we fought and died together.

1586
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:14,040
We come to honor that allegiance.

1587
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:24,450
You are most welcome.

1588
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:33,760
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1589
02:47:07,390 --> 02:47:10,660
You could have picked a better spot.

1590
02:47:15,530 --> 02:47:19,730
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1591
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:27,670
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1592
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:30,800
Let's hope they last the night.

1593
02:49:12,250 --> 02:49:15,040
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1594
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:18,110
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1595
02:50:21,310 --> 02:50:23,110
So it begins.

1596
02:50:49,970 --> 02:50:51,340
Did they hit anything?

1597
02:50:52,010 --> 02:50:54,000
Give them a volley.

1598
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:56,270
- Fire!
- Fire!

1599
02:51:11,990 --> 02:51:13,690
Send them to me! Come on!

1600
02:51:34,450 --> 02:51:35,540
Good!

1601
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:45,310
Swords! Swords!

1602
02:52:23,390 --> 02:52:25,520
Legolas! Two already!

1603
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:27,820
I'm on 17!

1604
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,560
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1605
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:39,100
Nineteen!

1606
02:53:05,070 --> 02:53:06,500
Merry.

1607
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:14,710
We have just agreed.

1608
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:26,190
Yes?

1609
02:53:27,690 --> 02:53:31,850
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1610
02:53:32,990 --> 02:53:36,230
...and we have agreed...

1611
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:40,720
...you are not Orcs.

1612
02:53:42,470 --> 02:53:44,600
Well, that's good news.

1613
02:53:44,770 --> 02:53:48,900
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1614
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:53,340
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1615
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:55,040
Hasty?

1616
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:57,720
Our friends are out there.

1617
02:53:57,880 --> 02:54:02,050
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1618
02:54:02,390 --> 02:54:04,650
War? Yes.

1619
02:54:04,820 --> 02:54:06,720
It affects us all.

1620
02:54:06,890 --> 02:54:09,880
Tree, root and twig.

1621
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:14,790
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1622
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,940
...it takes a long time...

1623
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:22,010
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1624
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:26,410
...and we never say anything...

1625
02:54:26,580 --> 02:54:30,480
...unless it is worth taking...

1626
02:54:30,650 --> 02:54:34,710
...a long time to say.

1627
02:54:35,490 --> 02:54:38,790
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1628
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:40,020
Nineteen!

1629
02:54:40,590 --> 02:54:42,460
Twenty!

1630
02:54:42,630 --> 02:54:44,290
Twenty-one!

1631
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:56,360
Causeway!

1632
02:55:04,150 --> 02:55:06,510
Is this it?

1633
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:09,620
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1634
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:36,970
Brace the gate!

1635
02:56:55,290 --> 02:56:57,550
Hold them! Stand firm!

1636
02:57:05,430 --> 02:57:06,760
Aragorn!

1637
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:12,600
Gimli!

1638
02:58:01,350 --> 02:58:05,290
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1639
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:10,080
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1640
02:58:10,890 --> 02:58:12,980
How can that be your decision?!

1641
02:58:13,660 --> 02:58:17,290
This is not our war.

1642
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,790
But you're part of this world!

1643
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:25,770
Aren't you?!

1644
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:32,210
You must help. Please.

1645
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:36,280
You must do something.

1646
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:40,850
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1647
02:58:42,060 --> 02:58:45,790
But your part in this tale is over.

1648
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:48,190
Go back to your home.

1649
02:58:58,200 --> 02:59:00,470
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1650
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:02,510
We don't belong here, Merry.

1651
02:59:02,680 --> 02:59:04,940
It's too big for us.

1652
02:59:05,110 --> 02:59:07,770
What can we do in the end?

1653
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:12,710
We've got the Shire.

1654
02:59:13,250 --> 02:59:15,780
Maybe we should go home.

1655
02:59:17,620 --> 02:59:20,860
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1656
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:25,930
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1657
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:27,690
And...

1658
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:32,560
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1659
02:59:36,110 --> 02:59:39,040
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1660
02:59:58,560 --> 02:59:59,790
Aragorn!

1661
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:02,330
Fall back to the Keep!

1662
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:05,590
Get your men out of there!

1663
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:16,910
Haldir!

1664
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:24,280
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1665
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:44,730
Haldir!

1666
03:01:27,410 --> 03:01:28,900
Brace the gate!

1667
03:01:31,150 --> 03:01:32,450
Hold them!

1668
03:01:34,290 --> 03:01:37,650
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1669
03:02:05,790 --> 03:02:07,720
Make way!

1670
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:12,350
We cannot hold much longer!

1671
03:02:18,330 --> 03:02:21,890
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1672
03:02:22,070 --> 03:02:24,630
As long as you can give me.

1673
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:26,460
Gimli!

1674
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:29,300
Timbers!

1675
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:31,440
Brace the gate!

1676
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:47,920
Come on. We can take them.

1677
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:50,390
It's a long way.

1678
03:02:55,630 --> 03:02:57,390
Toss me.

1679
03:02:58,570 --> 03:03:00,400
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1680
03:03:00,570 --> 03:03:02,130
You'll have to toss me!

1681
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:09,000
Don't tell the Elf.

1682
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:11,310
Not a word.

1683
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:27,990
Shore up the door!

1684
03:03:28,160 --> 03:03:30,260
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1685
03:03:30,430 --> 03:03:31,490
Watch our backs!

1686
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:37,870
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1687
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:29,220
Hold fast the gate!

1688
03:04:33,460 --> 03:04:36,390
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1689
03:04:41,130 --> 03:04:42,720
Aragorn!

1690
03:05:16,170 --> 03:05:18,600
Pull everybody back.

1691
03:05:18,970 --> 03:05:20,770
Pull them back.

1692
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:22,770
Fall back!

1693
03:05:22,940 --> 03:05:25,430
Fall back!

1694
03:05:26,610 --> 03:05:28,300
They have broken through!

1695
03:05:28,480 --> 03:05:30,740
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1696
03:05:30,910 --> 03:05:33,140
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1697
03:05:33,310 --> 03:05:35,910
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1698
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:38,350
Into the Keep!

1699
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:54,760
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1700
03:05:54,940 --> 03:05:59,630
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1701
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,640
Wait! Stop!

1702
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:09,040
Stop!

1703
03:06:12,150 --> 03:06:13,880
Turn around.

1704
03:06:14,790 --> 03:06:17,480
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1705
03:06:17,660 --> 03:06:22,650
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1706
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,690
Yes. Exactly.

1707
03:06:25,870 --> 03:06:29,100
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1708
03:06:29,270 --> 03:06:31,930
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1709
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:34,090
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1710
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:39,740
That doesn't make sense to me.

1711
03:06:39,910 --> 03:06:41,070
But then...

1712
03:06:41,250 --> 03:06:43,940
...you are very small.

1713
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:46,180
Perhaps you're right.

1714
03:06:48,820 --> 03:06:50,340
South it is, then.

1715
03:06:51,860 --> 03:06:55,190
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1716
03:06:57,230 --> 03:06:59,990
I always like going south.

1717
03:07:00,160 --> 03:07:04,470
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1718
03:07:05,070 --> 03:07:07,540
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1719
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:09,640
No, we won't.

1720
03:07:10,380 --> 03:07:12,640
Not this time.

1721
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:20,310
Look!

1722
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:24,390
Osgiliath burns!

1723
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:25,990
Mordor has come.

1724
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:29,520
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1725
03:07:30,860 --> 03:07:33,060
It has only the power to destroy.

1726
03:07:33,960 --> 03:07:35,400
Please...

1727
03:07:35,560 --> 03:07:37,190
...let me go.

1728
03:07:38,230 --> 03:07:39,830
Hurry.

1729
03:07:43,310 --> 03:07:44,710
Faramir!

1730
03:07:44,870 --> 03:07:47,370
You must let me go!

1731
03:07:47,810 --> 03:07:51,250
And those little family of field mice...

1732
03:07:51,410 --> 03:07:54,250
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1733
03:07:54,980 --> 03:07:58,280
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1734
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:12,400
Many of these trees were my friends.

1735
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:17,730
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1736
03:08:18,910 --> 03:08:20,100
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1737
03:08:20,270 --> 03:08:23,040
They had voices of their own.

1738
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:27,840
Saruman.

1739
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:31,240
A wizard should know better!

1740
03:08:45,530 --> 03:08:49,160
There is no curse in Elvish...

1741
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:52,030
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1742
03:08:52,210 --> 03:08:54,540
...for this treachery.

1743
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:58,770
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1744
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:04,680
Where are they going?

1745
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:08,450
They have business with the Orcs.

1746
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:13,190
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1747
03:09:13,360 --> 03:09:15,990
...with rock and stone.

1748
03:09:39,920 --> 03:09:41,040
Yes.

1749
03:09:42,150 --> 03:09:43,590
Come, my friends.

1750
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:49,120
The Ents are going to war.

1751
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:51,060
It is likely...

1752
03:09:51,230 --> 03:09:54,760
...that we go to our doom.

1753
03:09:56,170 --> 03:09:58,630
Last march...

1754
03:09:59,170 --> 03:10:01,190
...of the Ents.

1755
03:10:49,320 --> 03:10:53,050
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1756
03:10:53,220 --> 03:10:55,280
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1757
03:10:58,060 --> 03:10:59,530
Mr. Frodo?

1758
03:10:59,830 --> 03:11:03,920
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1759
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:06,590
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1760
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:22,310
Take them to my father.

1761
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:26,880
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1762
03:11:29,290 --> 03:11:32,310
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1763
03:11:33,490 --> 03:11:36,190
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1764
03:11:36,830 --> 03:11:39,590
You want to know
why your brother died?

1765
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:43,830
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1766
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,900
He tried to kill him!

1767
03:11:46,070 --> 03:11:48,400
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1768
03:11:49,170 --> 03:11:51,040
Watch out!

1769
03:12:01,950 --> 03:12:03,080
Mr. Frodo?

1770
03:12:05,720 --> 03:12:07,560
They're here.

1771
03:12:10,660 --> 03:12:13,130
They've come.

1772
03:12:15,700 --> 03:12:17,600
Nazgul!

1773
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:41,880
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1774
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:45,920
Take cover!

1775
03:13:03,250 --> 03:13:04,800
The fortress is taken.

1776
03:13:05,580 --> 03:13:06,770
It is over.

1777
03:13:06,950 --> 03:13:10,880
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1778
03:13:11,050 --> 03:13:13,990
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1779
03:13:16,720 --> 03:13:18,120
They're breaking in!

1780
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:23,250
They're past the door!

1781
03:13:26,600 --> 03:13:30,730
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1782
03:13:33,410 --> 03:13:35,340
Is there no other way?

1783
03:13:36,910 --> 03:13:39,970
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1784
03:13:40,650 --> 03:13:42,840
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1785
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:50,120
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1786
03:13:50,290 --> 03:13:53,160
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1787
03:13:55,330 --> 03:13:58,730
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1788
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:04,840
Ride out with me.

1789
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:10,570
Ride out and meet them.

1790
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:13,500
For death and glory.

1791
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:15,080
For Rohan.

1792
03:14:16,580 --> 03:14:18,050
For your people.

1793
03:14:18,780 --> 03:14:20,720
The sun is rising.

1794
03:14:25,220 --> 03:14:28,220
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

1795
03:14:28,390 --> 03:14:29,790
At dawn...

1796
03:14:29,960 --> 03:14:31,660
...look to the east.

1797
03:14:35,870 --> 03:14:37,490
Yes.

1798
03:14:39,970 --> 03:14:41,630
Yes.

1799
03:14:42,970 --> 03:14:45,370
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1800
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:48,340
...shall sound in the Deep...

1801
03:14:48,780 --> 03:14:50,770
...one last time.

1802
03:14:50,950 --> 03:14:52,440
Yes!

1803
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:59,280
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1804
03:15:07,060 --> 03:15:08,390
Fell deeds, awake.

1805
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:10,690
Now for wrath...

1806
03:15:10,870 --> 03:15:14,270
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1807
03:15:21,310 --> 03:15:23,570
Forth Eorlingas!

1808
03:16:11,360 --> 03:16:12,590
Gandalf.

1809
03:16:19,870 --> 03:16:23,530
Theoden King stands alone.

1810
03:16:24,140 --> 03:16:26,300
Not alone.

1811
03:16:26,710 --> 03:16:27,830
Rohirrim!

1812
03:16:33,750 --> 03:16:34,910
Eomer.

1813
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:37,610
To the king!

1814
03:17:55,220 --> 03:17:56,990
Yes!

1815
03:18:06,130 --> 03:18:09,570
A hit. A fine hit.

1816
03:18:34,130 --> 03:18:36,600
Break the dam!

1817
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:40,200
Release the river!

1818
03:19:07,530 --> 03:19:10,260
Pippin! Hold on!

1819
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:18,470
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1820
03:19:59,810 --> 03:20:01,840
What are you doing?

1821
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:11,980
Where are you going?

1822
03:21:10,140 --> 03:21:11,470
It's me.

1823
03:21:13,980 --> 03:21:16,170
It's your Sam.

1824
03:21:20,520 --> 03:21:23,150
Don't you know your Sam?

1825
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:44,240
I can't do this, Sam.

1826
03:21:45,140 --> 03:21:47,130
I know.

1827
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:50,510
It's all wrong.

1828
03:21:51,250 --> 03:21:53,270
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1829
03:22:00,690 --> 03:22:02,790
But we are.

1830
03:22:09,200 --> 03:22:12,230
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1831
03:22:12,400 --> 03:22:14,800
The ones that really mattered.

1832
03:22:15,840 --> 03:22:18,830
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1833
03:22:19,010 --> 03:22:21,980
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1834
03:22:22,150 --> 03:22:25,080
...because how could the end be happy?

1835
03:22:27,650 --> 03:22:29,840
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1836
03:22:30,020 --> 03:22:33,510
...when so much bad had happened?

1837
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:36,260
Victory!

1838
03:22:36,430 --> 03:22:37,980
We have victory!

1839
03:22:38,160 --> 03:22:42,100
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1840
03:22:42,270 --> 03:22:43,600
...this shadow.

1841
03:22:43,770 --> 03:22:46,170
Even darkness must pass.

1842
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:49,030
A new day will come.

1843
03:22:49,200 --> 03:22:53,160
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1844
03:22:55,080 --> 03:22:57,440
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1845
03:22:57,610 --> 03:22:59,380
...that meant something.

1846
03:22:59,550 --> 03:23:02,110
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1847
03:23:03,480 --> 03:23:07,350
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1848
03:23:07,520 --> 03:23:09,080
I know now.

1849
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:12,120
Folk in those stories...

1850
03:23:12,290 --> 03:23:16,420
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1851
03:23:16,600 --> 03:23:18,830
They kept going...

1852
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:22,770
...because they were holding
on to something.

1853
03:23:24,370 --> 03:23:26,670
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1854
03:23:38,620 --> 03:23:42,550
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1855
03:23:42,820 --> 03:23:45,450
And it's worth fighting for.

1856
03:24:12,350 --> 03:24:16,650
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1857
03:24:17,390 --> 03:24:21,350
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1858
03:24:21,530 --> 03:24:23,720
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1859
03:24:28,100 --> 03:24:29,500
Then it is forfeit.

1860
03:24:32,230 --> 03:24:34,030
Release them.

1861
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:48,140
Stay out of the forest!

1862
03:24:48,320 --> 03:24:50,120
Keep away from the trees!

1863
03:25:40,940 --> 03:25:42,730
Final count...

1864
03:25:42,900 --> 03:25:45,810
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?

1865
03:25:47,270 --> 03:25:52,040
That's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1866
03:25:52,850 --> 03:25:56,510
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1867
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:03,920
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1868
03:26:04,690 --> 03:26:07,180
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1869
03:26:07,360 --> 03:26:12,060
...because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1870
03:26:14,270 --> 03:26:18,970
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1871
03:26:19,240 --> 03:26:22,770
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1872
03:26:22,940 --> 03:26:25,910
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1873
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:28,910
I hear the staff are very good.

1874
03:26:34,590 --> 03:26:36,950
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1875
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:41,390
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1876
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:42,790
I'm starving.

1877
03:26:42,960 --> 03:26:46,050
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1878
03:26:46,230 --> 03:26:49,290
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1879
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:15,660
Saruman's storeroom!

1880
03:27:17,990 --> 03:27:20,720
I don't believe it.

1881
03:27:20,900 --> 03:27:22,960
It can't be.

1882
03:27:23,570 --> 03:27:26,470
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1883
03:27:27,770 --> 03:27:30,070
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1884
03:27:30,440 --> 03:27:33,530
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1885
03:27:33,710 --> 03:27:34,830
Wait.

1886
03:27:35,580 --> 03:27:36,810
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1887
03:27:36,980 --> 03:27:38,500
Share it?

1888
03:27:40,350 --> 03:27:42,750
No. No.

1889
03:27:44,250 --> 03:27:45,580
Dead plant and all that.

1890
03:27:46,020 --> 03:27:48,180
Don't think he'd understand.

1891
03:27:49,460 --> 03:27:51,650
Could be a distant relative.

1892
03:27:52,430 --> 03:27:54,950
I get it.

1893
03:27:55,130 --> 03:27:57,930
Don't be hasty.

1894
03:27:59,030 --> 03:28:00,800
Exactly.

1895
03:28:01,870 --> 03:28:04,130
Bar-hrum.

1896
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:31,060
This is the old sewer.

1897
03:28:31,230 --> 03:28:34,360
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1898
03:28:34,530 --> 03:28:36,260
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1899
03:28:37,340 --> 03:28:39,810
Captain Faramir...

1900
03:28:40,440 --> 03:28:42,270
...you have shown your quality, sir.

1901
03:28:44,780 --> 03:28:46,070
The very highest.

1902
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:49,210
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1903
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:52,320
...where gardeners are held in high honor.

1904
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:55,490
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1905
03:28:56,090 --> 03:28:57,650
Gollum says there's a path...

1906
03:28:57,820 --> 03:29:01,760
...near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1907
03:29:02,230 --> 03:29:03,960
Cirith Ungol?

1908
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:10,060
- Is that its name?
- No.

1909
03:29:10,240 --> 03:29:11,900
No!

1910
03:29:12,740 --> 03:29:15,730
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1911
03:29:16,110 --> 03:29:19,630
...they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1912
03:29:20,550 --> 03:29:23,070
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1913
03:29:23,410 --> 03:29:29,680
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1914
03:29:31,190 --> 03:29:32,980
I must.

1915
03:29:36,560 --> 03:29:40,120
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1916
03:29:40,300 --> 03:29:42,320
Thank you.

1917
03:29:54,140 --> 03:29:58,270
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1918
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:12,280
Come on, keep up.

1919
03:30:15,730 --> 03:30:18,530
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1920
03:30:19,170 --> 03:30:21,000
You know that, don't you?

1921
03:30:21,800 --> 03:30:23,360
He was trying to save you, see?

1922
03:30:23,870 --> 03:30:25,400
Save me?

1923
03:30:25,740 --> 03:30:27,900
So there's no hard feelings.

1924
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:33,210
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1925
03:30:33,380 --> 03:30:36,010
Gollum, Gollum.

1926
03:30:37,050 --> 03:30:38,810
Yes, master.

1927
03:30:39,890 --> 03:30:42,720
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1928
03:30:42,890 --> 03:30:45,190
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1929
03:30:50,700 --> 03:30:55,900
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1930
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:06,030
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1931
03:31:06,710 --> 03:31:10,240
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1932
03:31:15,390 --> 03:31:18,820
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1933
03:31:19,790 --> 03:31:23,020
...somewhere in the wilderness.

1934
03:31:26,330 --> 03:31:29,730
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1935
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:31,270
What?

1936
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:35,390
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "

1937
03:31:35,570 --> 03:31:38,840
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. "

1938
03:31:39,010 --> 03:31:41,940
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1939
03:31:42,110 --> 03:31:43,770
"Yes, my boy.

1940
03:31:43,950 --> 03:31:47,750
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "

1941
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:50,440
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1942
03:31:50,620 --> 03:31:52,520
"Samwise the Brave. "

1943
03:31:52,690 --> 03:31:55,420
I want to hear more about Sam.

1944
03:31:59,730 --> 03:32:02,720
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1945
03:32:04,070 --> 03:32:08,090
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1946
03:32:09,210 --> 03:32:10,570
So was I.

1947
03:32:19,450 --> 03:32:22,150
"Samwise the Brave. "

1948
03:32:26,420 --> 03:32:27,750
Smeagol?

1949
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:30,820
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1950
03:32:30,990 --> 03:32:32,930
Master.

1951
03:32:33,090 --> 03:32:36,060
Master looks after us.

1952
03:32:36,830 --> 03:32:39,630
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1953
03:32:39,800 --> 03:32:42,270
Master broke his promise.

1954
03:32:42,440 --> 03:32:44,600
Don't ask Smeagol.

1955
03:32:44,770 --> 03:32:47,970
Poor, poor Smeagol.

1956
03:32:48,140 --> 03:32:50,970
Master betrayed us.

1957
03:32:51,140 --> 03:32:54,240
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1958
03:32:54,420 --> 03:32:58,320
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1959
03:32:58,490 --> 03:33:01,220
Kill him! Kill him!

1960
03:33:01,390 --> 03:33:02,880
Kill them both!

1961
03:33:03,060 --> 03:33:06,690
And then we take the precious...

1962
03:33:06,860 --> 03:33:10,390
...and we be the master!

1963
03:33:11,060 --> 03:33:13,730
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1964
03:33:13,900 --> 03:33:16,560
Eyes always watching.

1965
03:33:16,740 --> 03:33:20,300
Then we stabs them out.

1966
03:33:20,470 --> 03:33:24,970
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1967
03:33:25,140 --> 03:33:28,600
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1968
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:31,480
Kill them both.

1969
03:33:31,650 --> 03:33:34,140
Yes. No! No!

1970
03:33:34,320 --> 03:33:38,020
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1971
03:33:38,720 --> 03:33:41,320
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1972
03:33:41,490 --> 03:33:44,090
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

1973
03:33:44,260 --> 03:33:49,670
We could let her do it.

1974
03:33:50,640 --> 03:33:54,760
Yes. She could do it.

1975
03:33:54,940 --> 03:33:59,500
Yes, precious, she could.

1976
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:05,710
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1977
03:34:06,650 --> 03:34:09,480
Once they're dead.

1978
03:34:13,890 --> 03:34:17,590
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1979
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:19,820
Smeagol will show you the way.
