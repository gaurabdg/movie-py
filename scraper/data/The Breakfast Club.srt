It's so absurd I have to
be here on a Saturday.

It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

I'll make it up to you.

doesn't make you a defective.

Last.

Well, get in there and use the time
to your advantage.

We have to sit there and do nothing.

There's nothing wrong with that...

except you
got caught, sport.
Yeah, Mom already reamed me.

You want to blow your ride?

Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

All right, people,
we're going to try something
a little different today.

describing to me
who you think you are.
Is this a test?

00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:05,748
And when I say essay,
I mean essay.

72

I do not mean a single word
repeated a thousand times.

Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not
you care to return.

Uh, I can answer
that right now, sir.

Well, you wouldn't know.
You don't even know any of us.

154
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,782
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

155
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,188
but I'm not going to run
and join one of their fucking clubs.

156
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,057
Hey, let's watch
the mouth, huh?
I'm in Physics Club too.

157
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,393
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

158
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,628
What I said was that
I'm in the Math Club...

159
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:27,864
uh, the Latin Club
and the Physics Club... Physics Club.

160
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,672
Hey. Cherry.

161
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:36,845
Do you belong to
the Physics Club?

162
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:40,247
That's an academic club.
So?

163
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,846
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

164
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:48,380
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

165
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,657
What do you guys
do in your club?

166
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:57,393
In physics, well, we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

167
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:02,666
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad, but social, right?

168
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,731
[Johnson] I guess
you could consider it
a social situation.

169
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,439
Um, I mean, there are
other children in my club. And, uh...

170
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:14,712
at the end of the year, we have, um,
we have a big banquet at the Hilton.

171
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,049
You load up. You party.

172
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,750
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

173
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:26,125
- Only burners like you get high.
- And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

174
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,858
It's weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me
to wear other people's shoes.

175
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:33,062
My counsel kent...
My cousin Kendall from Indiana,
he got high once.

176
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,969
And, you know, he started eating,
like, really weird foods.

177
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,032
Then he felt like he didn't
belong anywhere, kind of
like Twilight Zone, kinda?

178
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,944
- [Laughs] Sounds like you.
- You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

179
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:47,541
I got a meet this Saturday,
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

180
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,711
Oh, and wouldn't that
be a bite?
[Grunts]

181
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,720
Missing a whole
wrestling meet?

182
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,881
You wouldn't know
anything about it, faggot.

183
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,948
You never competed
in your whole life.

184
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:58,688
[Mock Crying]
Oh, I know. I feel
all empty inside because of it.

185
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:03,290
I have such a deep admiration
for guys who roll around
on the floor with other guys.

186
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,770
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.
Oh, but I do.

187
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,329
I want to be just like you.

188
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,467
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

189
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,403
You wear tights?

190
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,814
No, I don't wear tights.

191
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:23,682
- I wear the required uniform.
- Tights.

192
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,222
Shut up.

193
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:42,035
[Snorts]
Woo!

194
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,866
[Johnson]
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

195
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,607
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

196
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,043
[Boy]
Come on, Bender.
Don't screw around.

197
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,350
What are you
going to do?
Drop dead, I hope.

198
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,584
[Water Running]

199
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,062
[Shouts, Indistinct]
All right!

200
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:15,298
Bender, that's-that's
school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

201
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:18,739
- It's something not to be
toyed with.
- That's very funny. Fix it.

202
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,970
You should really fix that.
Am I a genius?

203
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,535
No, you're an asshole.
Fix the door, Bender.
What a funny guy.

204
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:26,548
Everyone, just shh.
I've been here before.
I know what I'm doing.

205
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,914
[Boy]
No. Fix the door.!
[Bender] Shut up.!

206
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,511
Goddamn it.!

207
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,115
Why is that door closed?

208
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:44,089
Why is that door closed?
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

209
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:51,339
- Why?
- We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

210
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,270
Who closed that door?

211
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,446
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

212
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,779
Who?
[Squeaks]

213
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:10,224
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- [Girl Squeaks]

214
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,228
- [Vernon]
Give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

215
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,594
You want me to yank you
out of that seat?

216
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:19,692
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.
The world's an imperfect place.

217
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,635
Give it to me, Bender.

218
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,037
Excuse me, sir.
Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

219
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,406
Watch it, young lady.

220
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:32,941
[Door Opens]

221
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,445
The door's
way too heavy, sir.

222
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,923
[Vernon]
Damn it.!
[Clattering]

223
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,132
Andrew Clark,
get up here.

224
00:17:56,206 --> 00:18:00,142
[Snaps Fingers]
Come on. Front and center.
Let's go.

225
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,701
- Hey, how come Andrew
gets to get up?
- That's right.

226
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:06,306
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy.!

227
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:11,276
Watch-Watch
the magazines.
It's out of my hands.

228
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:20,620
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

229
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:25,157
I think violating fire codes
and endangering the lives of children...

230
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,396
would be unwise at this juncture
in your career, sir.

231
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,963
All right. What are you doing
with this? Get this out of here,
for God's sake.

232
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,509
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

233
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:36,512
You know, the school
comes equipped with fire exits
at either end of the library.

234
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,981
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

235
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,518
Go. Get back in your seat.

236
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:48,683
I expected a little more
from a varsity letterman.

237
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,954
You're not fooling
anybody, Bender.

238
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,794
The next screw that
falls out is gonna be you.

239
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:59,962
- Eat my shorts.
- What was that?

240
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:05,540
Eat... my... shorts.

241
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,578
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

242
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,170
- Oh, I'm crushed.
- You just bought
one more right there.

243
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,184
Well, I'm free the Saturday
after that. Beyond that,
I'll have to check my calendar.

244
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,016
Good! Because it's gonna be filled.
We'll keep going.

245
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:21,819
You want another one?
Say the word. Just say the word.

246
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:25,726
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

247
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,888
- Are you through?
- No.

248
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:31,661
I'm doing society a favor.
That's another right now.
So?

249
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,568
I've got you for the rest
of your life if you don't
watch your step.

250
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,629
You want another one?
Yes.

251
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:39,869
You got it.! You got
another one right there.
That's another one, pal.

252
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,002
Cut it out!

253
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,308
- [Mouthing]
Stop.
- You through?

254
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,373
Not even close, bud.

255
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,544
- You got one more right there.
- You really think I give a shit?

256
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,588
Another.

257
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,850
- You through?
- How many is that?

258
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,589
That's seven, including
the one when you asked
Mr. Vernon here...

259
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,858
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

260
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,423
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

261
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,026
Shut up, peewee.

262
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:14,573
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got ya.

263
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,112
I got ya.

264
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,081
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

265
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,086
Oh, I sure that's exactly
what you want these people
to believe. You know something?

266
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:27,351
You ought to spend
a little more time trying to
do something with yourself...

267
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:30,291
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

268
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,091
You might be better off.
All right. That's it!

269
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:36,394
I'm gonna be
right outside those doors.

270
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:41,062
The next time
I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

271
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,409
Fuck you!

272
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,921
[Sighs]

273
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,352
Fuck.

274
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,588
Wake up!

275
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,196
Who has to go
to the lavatory?

276
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:17,855
- That's real intelligent.
- You're right.

277
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,918
It's wrong
to destroy literature.

278
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,829
It's such fun to read.

279
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,231
And...

280
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,764
"Molay" really pumps my nads.

281
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,570
Moliere.

282
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,937
I love his work.

283
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:50,091
Big deal. Nothing to do
when you're locked in a vacancy.

284
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,128
Speak for yourself.

285
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:57,861
Do you think I'd speak for you?
I don't even know your language.

286
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,665
Hey, you grounded tonight?

287
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:06,198
I don't know. My mom said I was.
My dad told me just to blow her off.

288
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:14,305
There's a big party at Stubby's.
His parents are in Europe.

289
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,842
It should be pretty wild.
Are you going to go?
Yeah?

290
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,682
- I doubt it.
- How come?

291
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:25,751
'Cause if I do what my mother
tells me not to do, it's because
my father says it's okay.

292
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,162
It's like this whole, big monster deal.
It's endless. It's a total drag.

293
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,166
It's like,
any minute, divorce.

294
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:34,692
- Who do you like better?
- What?

295
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:37,899
- You like your old man
better than your mom?
- They're both screwed.

296
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:40,465
No, I mean, if you had
to choose between 'em.

297
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,342
I don't know. Probably go live

00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:59,948
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

449
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:02,183
Let's just drop it, okay?
We'll talk about it later.

450
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:04,726
- What are you talking about?
- Brian's trying to tell me...

451
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:08,058
that in addition to the number of girls
in the Niagara Falls area...

452
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,032
that presently you and he
are riding the hobby horse.

453
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:14,592
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not.

454
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,901
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't.
That's all that was said.

455
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,737
Then what were you
motioning to Claire for?

456
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:24,768
- I don't appreciate this
very much, Brian.
- He is lying.

457
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:28,078
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

458
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,881
You know he's lying, right?
Were you or were you not
motioning to Claire?

459
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:35,446
Yeah, but it was only...

460
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:38,425
It was only because
I didn't want her
to know I was a virgin.

461
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,857
Excuse me for
being a virgin. I'm sorry.

462
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:44,866
[Scoffs]
Why didn't you want me
to know you were a virgin?

463
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:48,131
Because it's personal business.
It's my personal, private
business.

464
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,468
Well, Brian, it doesn't sound
like you're doing any business.

465
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:53,235
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

466
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:56,941
You do?

467
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:09,350

You're wearing it.
You're nauseating.

470
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:33,238
What's that?

471
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:36,944
- Sushi.

Rice, raw fish
and seaweed.

a guy's tongue in your mouth,
and you're gonna eat that?

PB&J with the crusts cut off.

484

Well, Brian, this is
a very nutritious lunch.

to go fishing this weekend?

Great, Dad.
But I've got homework to do.

- You want to come over sometime?

That's the last time, Bender.

That's the last time you ever
make me look bad in front of
those kids. You hear me?

604
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,065
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

take your word over mine?

Come on. Right here.

Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

01:01:45,399 --> 01:01:47,959
I'll do what
I have to do.

749
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:51,334
Why do you have to
do anything?

750
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:56,433
My home life...
is unsatisfying.

751
01:01:58,012 --> 01:02:00,242
So you're saying you'd subject yourself
to the violent dangers...

752
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:03,806
of these Chicago streets
because your home life is unsatisfying?

753
01:02:03,884 --> 01:02:05,818
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

754
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:07,820
I can run away
and go to the ocean.

755
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:09,822
I can go to the country,
to the mountains.

756
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:13,485
I could go to Israel,
Africa... Afghanistan.

757
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:24,797
Andy, wanna get in
on this?

758
01:02:24,872 --> 01:02:28,035
Allison here says
she wants to run away...

759
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:31,977
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

760
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:35,709
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

761
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:40,478
And if it wasn't,
people would live
with their parents forever.

762
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:43,785
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond...

763
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:48,557
what, you know,
guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying.

764
01:02:48,629 --> 01:02:52,360
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

765
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:55,095
- What's the deal?
- No.

766
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:57,535
There's no deal, sporto.

767
01:02:57,605 --> 01:03:00,335
Forget it.
Leave me alone.
Wait a minute.

768
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,433
You're carrying all that crap
around in your purse.

769
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:07,003
Either you really wanna
run away, or you want people
to think you wanna run away.

770
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,811
Eat shit!

771
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:15,783
The girl is an island
unto herself, okay?

772
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:28,065
Hi.

773
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:30,126
You wanna talk?
No.

774
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:33,970
Why not?
Go away.

775
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:37,939
Where do you
want me to go?
Go away!

776
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:51,583
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems.

777
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,628
You do everything
everybody tells you to do.
That is a problem.

778
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:57,391
Okay, fine.
But I didn't dump my purse
out on the couch...

779
01:03:57,464 --> 01:04:02,993
and invite people
into my problems, did I?

780
01:04:07,675 --> 01:04:09,609
So what's wrong?

781
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:12,945
What is it?

782
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:18,278
[Sighs]
Is it bad?

783
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,847
Real bad?

784
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:23,856
Parents?

785
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,198
Yeah.

786
01:04:50,718 --> 01:04:52,811
What did they do to you?

787
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:57,819
They ignore me.

788
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:01,127
Yeah.

789
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,855
Yeah.

790
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:11,193
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

791
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:16,035
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be John Lennon.

792
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:19,509
Carl, don't be a goof.

793
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,208
I'm trying to make
a serious point here.

794
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:25,150
Carl, I've been teaching
for 22 years.

795
01:05:26,954 --> 01:05:30,515
And each year, these kids
get more and more arrogant.

796
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:33,355
Oh, bullshit, man.
Come on, Vern.

797
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:37,090
- The kids haven't changed,
you have.
- [Sighs]

798
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:41,362
You took a teaching position
'cause you thought
it'd be fun, right?

799
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:44,598
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

800
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:48,506
And then you found out
it was actually work.
That really bummed you out.

801
01:05:51,211 --> 01:05:53,236
These kids turned on me.

802
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:59,416
They think
I'm a big fucking joke.
Come on.

803
01:05:59,486 --> 01:06:04,253
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

804
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:09,058
Hey, Carl, you think
I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

805
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:11,529
Yes, I do.

806
01:06:11,598 --> 01:06:16,001
You think about this.
When you get old, these kids...

807
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:19,062
when I get old... they're gonna be
running the country.

808
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:21,300
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

809
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:24,776
Now this is the thought
that wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

810
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,741
When I get older,
these kids are gonna
take care of me.

811
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:33,451
I wouldn't count on it.

812
01:06:36,857 --> 01:06:40,258
What would I do
for a million bucks?

813
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:43,194
I guess I'd do
as little as I had to.

814
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:45,731
That's boring.
Well, how am I
supposed to answer?

815
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:50,099
The idea is to, like, search your mind
for the absolute limit.

816
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:54,470
Like, um... would you
drive to school naked?

817
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,009
[Chuckles]

818
01:06:57,077 --> 01:07:00,604
Um... would I have to
get out of the car?

819
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:04,617
- Of course.
- In the spring or winter?

820
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:06,619
[Claire]
Doesn't matter. Spring.

821
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:09,178
[Andy]
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

822
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:12,157
- Either one.
- Yes.

823
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:14,592
I'd do that.

824
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:18,028
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars
to do it either.

825
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:22,501
- You're lying.
- I already have.

826
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:25,970
I've done just about
everything there is, except
a few things that are illegal.

827
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:31,834
- I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Lie.

828
01:07:31,912 --> 01:07:33,971
Are your parents
aware of this?

829
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:36,881
The only person I told
was my shrink.

830
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,111
What did he do
when you told him?

831
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:41,211
He nailed me.

832
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:47,126
Very nice.

833
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,287
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint...

834
01:07:49,363 --> 01:07:52,355
what he did can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

835
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:56,529
- He's an adult.
- Yeah. He's married too.

836
01:07:56,603 --> 01:08:00,801
Oh! Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

837
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:04,139
Well, the first
few times...
The first few times?

838
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:06,543
You mean, he did it
more than once?
Sure.

839
01:08:06,613 --> 01:08:10,071
Are you crazy?
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

840
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,544
Have you ever done it?

841
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,850
[Scoffs]
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

842
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,326
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

843
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:25,525
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered the question.

844
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:29,797
Look. I'm not going to discuss
my private life with total strangers.

845
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,929
It's kind of a
double-edged sword, isn't it?

846
01:08:32,005 --> 01:08:36,339
A what?
If you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

847
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,471
If you say you have,
you're a slut. It's a trap.

848
01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,481
You want to,
but you can't.

849
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:46,383
And when you do, you wish
you didn't, right?
Wrong.

850
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:48,944
Or are you a tease?

851
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:53,316
She's a tease.
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

852
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:56,556
You're a tease
and you know it.
All girls are teases.

853
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,622
- She's only a tease if what
she does gets you hot.
- I don't do anything!

854
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,364
- That's why you're a tease.
- Okay, let me ask you
a few questions.

855
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:06,633
I already
told you everything.
No.

856
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:09,972
Doesn't it bother you to sleep
around without being in love?
Don't you want respect?

857
01:09:10,043 --> 01:09:12,739
I don't screw
to get respect.

858
01:09:12,813 --> 01:09:14,747
That's the difference
between you and me.

859
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:16,908
[Scoffs]
It's not the only difference
I hope.

860
01:09:16,984 --> 01:09:19,578
[Bender]
Face it, you're a tease.
I'm not a tease.

861
01:09:19,653 --> 01:09:21,848
Sure you are.
Sex is your weapon.

862
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:24,823
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

863
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:28,658
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

864
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:31,823
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

865
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:35,426
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

866
01:09:35,502 --> 01:09:38,903
I didn't mean it that way.
You guys are putting words
into my mouth.

867
01:09:38,972 --> 01:09:41,770
- Just answer the question.
- [Brian] Why don't you
just answer the question?

868
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:44,709
Be honest.
No big deal.
Yeah, answer it.

869
01:09:44,778 --> 01:09:47,576
- Just answer the question.
- Talk to us.
- Answer the question.!

870
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:50,276
Don't be a jerk.!
It's easy.
It's only one question.

871
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,750
No, I never did it!

872
01:09:57,324 --> 01:10:00,623
I never did it either.

873
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:05,895
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

874
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,525
You are such a bitch!

875
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:12,868
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over.!

876
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,569
I would do it though.
If you love someone, it's okay.

877
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:20,041
[Claire]
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

878
01:10:20,113 --> 01:10:23,082
You don't say anything all day,
and then when
you open your mouth...

879
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,983
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

880
01:10:26,053 --> 01:10:29,580
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit something
you didn't want to admit to.

881
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:32,022
Okay, fine.
But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

882
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:36,188
What's bizarre?
I mean, we're all
pretty bizarre.

883
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:38,561
Some of us are just
better at hiding it, that's all.

884
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,657
How are you bizarre?

885
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:44,970
He can't think for himself.

886
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:49,601
She's right.

887
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:53,737
Do you guys know what, uh,
what I did to get in here?

888
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:57,514
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

889
01:10:57,584 --> 01:10:59,575
- [Laughs]
- That was you?

890
01:10:59,653 --> 01:11:03,612
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

891
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:06,352
Then you know how hairy
he is, right?

892
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:10,723
When they pulled
the tape off...

893
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:14,289
most of his hair came off
and some skin too.

894
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:16,700
Oh, my God.

895
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,534
The bizarre thing is...

896
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:21,699
is that I did it
for my old man.

897
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:26,273
I tortured this poor kid...

898
01:11:26,346 --> 01:11:29,144
because I wanted him
to think that I was cool.

899
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:36,178
He's always going off about,
you know, when he was in school.

900
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:39,714
All the wild things
he used to do.

901
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:45,629
And I got the feeling that
he was disappointed that I never
cut loose on anyone, right?

902
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:52,028
So, I'm sittin'
in the locker room...

903
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:54,596
and I'm taping up my knee.

904
01:11:56,343 --> 01:12:01,144
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

905
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:05,851
And... he's kind of...

906
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,853
he's kind of skinny.

907
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:10,583
He's weak.

908
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:14,525
And I started thinking
about my father...

909
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:18,963
and his attitude about...
about weakness.

910
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:22,934
And the next thing I knew...

911
01:12:23,003 --> 01:12:27,201
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

912
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:32,670
And my friends, they just laughed
and cheered me on.

913
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:39,210
And afterwards...

914
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:42,346
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

915
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:48,121
all I could think about...

916
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:51,722
was Larry's father...

917
01:12:51,798 --> 01:12:55,791
and Larry
having to go home...

918
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:00,272
and... and explain
what happened to him.

919
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:07,937
And... the humiliation...

920
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:11,142
fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

921
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:16,581
It must have been unreal.

922
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:23,094
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

923
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,834
There's no way.

924
01:13:33,006 --> 01:13:35,668
It's all because of me
and my old man.

925
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,814
God, I fucking hate him.

926
01:13:44,418 --> 01:13:49,412
He's like this...
He's like this mindless machine
that I can't relate to anymore.

927
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:56,157
Andrew.!
You've got to be number one.!

928
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:58,754
I won't tolerate any losers
in this family.

929
01:13:58,832 --> 01:14:03,633
Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!

930
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:07,836
You son of a bitch.

931
01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:15,204
You know sometimes
I wish my knee would give...

932
01:14:15,282 --> 01:14:18,308
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

933
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:22,515
Then he could forget
all about me.

934
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:25,820
I think your old man
and my old man should get
together and go bowling.

935
01:14:25,892 --> 01:14:27,860
[Chuckles]

936
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:34,032
It's like me, you know,
with my grades.

937
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,503
Like when l... when l...
when I step outside myself...

938
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,837
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

939
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:46,739
And l... And I see me.

940
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,984
I don't like what I see.

941
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:55,550
I really don't.

942
01:14:55,622 --> 01:15:00,685
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

943
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,751
Sounds stupid, but...

944
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:08,567
because I'm failing shop.

945
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:15,067
We had this assignment,
you know, to make this,
like, ceramic elephant...

946
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:17,439
and we had eight weeks
to do it.

947
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:21,072
And then, you know,
we're supposed to... It was like a lamp.

948
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:25,083
And when, you know,
when you pull it, the trunk,
the light was supposed to go on.

949
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,183
But my light didn't go on.

950
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:32,384
I got an "F" on it.

951
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,561
I've never got an "F" in my life.

952
01:15:36,963 --> 01:15:39,557
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean...

953
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:41,658
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know...

954
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:43,760
'cause I thought, you know,
I'll take shop.

955
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:46,271
It'll be such
an easy way to maintain
my grade point average.

956
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:48,273
Why'd you think
it'd be easy?

957
01:15:50,744 --> 01:15:52,871
Have you seen some of the dopes
that take shop?

958
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:56,882
I take shop.
You must be a fuckin'idiot.

959
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:58,747
I'm a fuckin' idiot
'cause I can't make a lamp?

960
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:01,378
No, you're a genius 'cause
you can't make a lamp.

961
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:04,150
What do you know
about trigonometry?

962
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:05,987
I could care less
about trigonometry.

963
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:08,960
Bender, did you know
without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

964
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:10,894
Without lamps,
there'd be no light.

965
01:16:10,964 --> 01:16:14,730
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than the other one.

966
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:17,133
I can write with my toes.

967
01:16:17,203 --> 01:16:20,604
I can also eat,
brush my teeth...

968
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:22,835
With your feet?

969
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:26,003
- Play "Heart And Soul" on the piano.
- I can make spaghetti.

970
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,980
What can you do?

971
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,315
I can, uh, tape
all of your buns together.

972
01:16:33,386 --> 01:16:36,287
I wanna see
what Claire can do.

973
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:39,086
- I can't do anything.
- Everybody can do something.

974
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:43,825
There's one thing I can do.

975
01:16:43,897 --> 01:16:47,196
- No, forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.
- You ever seen Wild Kingdom?

976
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:49,201
That guy's been doing
that show for 30 years.

977
01:16:50,503 --> 01:16:55,202
Okay. But you have to swear
to God you won't laugh.

978
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:57,368
[Scoffs]

979
01:16:58,378 --> 01:17:00,312
Okay.

980
01:17:02,215 --> 01:17:06,117
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

981
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:20,027
[Applause]
Yea.!

982
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,628
All right. That's great!
Where'd you learn to do that?

983
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:26,638
Camp.
Seventh grade.

984
01:17:26,706 --> 01:17:29,732
[Slow Clapping]

985
01:17:32,278 --> 01:17:34,212
That was great, Claire.

986
01:17:35,515 --> 01:17:37,813
My image of you
is totally blown.

987
01:17:37,884 --> 01:17:42,014
You're a shit.
Don't do that to her. You swore
to God you wouldn't laugh.

988
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:44,886
- Am I laughing?
- You fuckin' prick!

989
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:50,696
What do you care
what I think anyway?

990
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:55,423
I don't even count,
right?

991
01:17:55,502 --> 01:17:58,232
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

992
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:04,667
I may as well not even exist
at this school, remember?

993
01:18:07,947 --> 01:18:10,780
And you...
don't like me anyway.

994
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,819
You know, I have
just as many feelings
as you do...

995
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:16,412
and it hurts just as much
when somebody steps
all over them.

996
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:18,457
[Bender]
God, you're so pathetic.

997
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:23,622
Don't you ever,
ever compare yourself to me, okay?

998
01:18:23,697 --> 01:18:25,688
You got everything,
and I got shit.

999
01:18:25,765 --> 01:18:28,825
Fuckin'Rapunzel, right?

1000
01:18:28,902 --> 01:18:32,133
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up.

1001
01:18:32,205 --> 01:18:34,833
Queenie isn't here.

1002
01:18:34,908 --> 01:18:38,469
I like those earrings,
Claire.
Shut up.

1003
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,979
Are those real diamonds,
Claire?
Shut up!

1004
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:44,983
I bet they are.
Did you work for the money...

1005
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:47,747
Shut your mouth!
For those earrings?

1006
01:18:47,821 --> 01:18:50,551
Or did your daddy
buy those for you?
Shut up!

1007
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,853
I bet he bought those
for you.

1008
01:18:52,926 --> 01:18:56,862
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

1009
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:58,898
You know what I got
for Christmas this year?

1010
01:18:58,965 --> 01:19:03,800
It was a banner fucking year
at the old Bender family.
I got a carton of cigarettes.

1011
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:07,362
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny."

1012
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,170
Okay, so go home
and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

1013
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:18,242
[Claire Sniffling]

1014
01:19:23,356 --> 01:19:25,847
My God, are we gonna
be like our parents?

1015
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:27,984
Not me.

1016
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:32,698
Ever.

1017
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,768
It's unavoidable.

1018
01:19:37,837 --> 01:19:40,965
It just happens.

1019
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,008
[Claire]
What happens?

1020
01:19:44,444 --> 01:19:48,380
When you grow up,
your heart dies.

1021
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:52,885
- Who cares?
- I care.

1022
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,519
[Brian]
Um, I was just thinking,
I mean...

1023
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:02,459
I know it's kind of a weird time,
but I was just wondering, um...

1024
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:07,065
what is going to happen
to us on Monday...

1025
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:09,363
when we're all
together again?

1026
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:13,497
I mean, I consider
you guys my friends.

1027
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:19,139
- I'm not wrong, am I?
- No.

1028
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:22,739
So... So on Monday,
what happens?

1029
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:25,614
Are we still friends,
you mean?

1030
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:28,347
- If we're friends now, that is.
- Yeah.

1031
01:20:29,856 --> 01:20:33,314
- Do you want the truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.

1032
01:20:33,393 --> 01:20:35,884
[Sighs]
I don't think so.

1033
01:20:38,331 --> 01:20:43,200
- With all of us or just John?
- With all of you.

1034
01:20:43,269 --> 01:20:47,171
That's a real nice
attitude, Claire.
Oh, be honest, Andy.

1035
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:51,370
If Brian came walking up to you
in the hall on Monday,
what would you do?

1036
01:20:51,444 --> 01:20:54,538
I mean, picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

1037
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:57,777
You know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi to him,
and when he left...

1038
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:01,184
you'd cut him all up
so your friends wouldn't think
you really liked him.

1039
01:21:01,254 --> 01:21:04,417
- No way.
- [Allison] Okay.

1040
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:08,358
- What if I came up to you?
- Same exact thing.

1041
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:11,295
You are a bitch!

1042
01:21:11,364 --> 01:21:14,697
Why, 'cause I'm telling the truth?
That makes me a bitch?

1043
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:16,792
No, you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

1044
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:19,270
And you don't got the balls
to stand up to your friends...

1045
01:21:19,339 --> 01:21:21,466
and tell them you're gonna like
