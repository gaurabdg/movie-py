... stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.

The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...

A drink, perhaps?

740
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,374
Is it poison?

Yes.

746
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,860
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.

747
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:47,406
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.

748
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,201
But why would I want to do that?

749
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,164
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.

750
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,082
True.

751
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,085
But this is politics, not war.

752
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,921
Leonidas is an idealist.

753
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:06,258
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.

754
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:11,347
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.

755
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:16,143
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.

756
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,647
- I"m simply a realist.
- You"re an opportunist.

757
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:24,902
You"re as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.

758
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,657
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

759
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,746
I admire your passion.

760
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,791
But don't think that you...

761
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,585
... a woman, even a queen...

762
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:45,673
... can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.

763
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,259
I own that chamber...

764
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,511
... as if it were built with these hands.

765
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,519
I could crush
the life out of you right now.

766
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:03,274
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.

767
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:09,196
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...

768
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,324
... he will go to jail or worse.

769

Do you love your Sparta?

Yes.

- And your king?
- I do.

772

Your husband fights for his land
and his love.

773

What do you have to offer...

774
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:38,434
... in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?

775
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,065
What does a realist want with his queen?

776
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:51,405
I think you know.

777
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,547
This will not be over quickly.

778
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,092
You will not enjoy this.

01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,544
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?

782
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,714
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.

783
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:54,093
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.

My captain?

785

Curses the gods and mourns alone.

787
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,151
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.

788
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,736
Daxos, calm yourself.

789
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,532
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' Immortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.

790
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:19,743
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

791
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:25,165
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.

792
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:29,712
By morning, the Immortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.

793
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:34,717
Spartans! Prepare for glory!

794
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,095
Glory? Have you gone mad?

795
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,805
There is no glory to be had now.

796
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:44,018
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.

797
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,354
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.

798
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:53,027
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

799
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,738
Go spread the word.

800
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,616
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

801
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:02,619
Let each among them
search his own soul.

802
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:08,459
And while you"re at it, search your own.

803
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,260
My men will leave with me.

804
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,809
Godspeed, Leonidas.

805
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,734
Children!

806
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,028
Children.

807

Gather round.

808
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,203
No retreat, no surrender.

809
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:48,248
That is Spartan law.

810
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,545
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...

811
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,714
... and die.

812
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,679
A new age has begun.

813
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,518
An age of freedom.

814
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:12,272
And all will know that 300 Spartans...

815
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,692
... gave their last breath to defend it.

816
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,756
My friend.

817
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:46,890
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

818
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:56,191
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.

819
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:01,947
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.

820
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,410
That he stood by me with honor.

821
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,789
That he was all that was best in me.

822
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,426
My heart is broken for your loss.

823
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,887
Heart?

824
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:33,061
I have filled my heart...

825
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:34,938
... with hate.

826
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,777
Good.

827
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,747
Dilios...

828
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,584
... let's take a walk.

829
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,129
Yes, my lord.

830
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:04,176
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.

831
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:07,471
That you are, one of the finest.

832
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:11,391
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

833
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,522
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...

834
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,192
... with force and verve.

835
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,988
Tell them our story.

836
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:29,660
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

837
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,163
You'll have a grand tale to tell.

838
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,667
A tale of victory.

839
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,877
Victory.

840
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,925
Yes, my lord.

841
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:52,975
Sire, any message... ?

842
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:57,187
For the queen?

843
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:22,087
None that need be spoken.

844
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,604
Hundreds leave.

845
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,691
A handful stay.

846
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,490
Only one looks back.

847
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:03,003
Spartans!

848
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,257
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...

849
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:11,345
... for tonight we dine in hell!

850
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,898
May I give the floor now...

851
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:27,486
... to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.

852
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,957
- What's this?
- This is nothing.

853
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,959
Councilmen...

854
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:46,880
... I stand before you
not only as your queen.

855
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,467
I come to you as a mother.

856
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:54,137
I come to you as a wife.

857
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,475
I come to you as a Spartan woman.

858
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:06,608
I come to you with great humility.

859
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:12,447
I am not here to represent Leonidas.

860
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,367
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

861
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:18,120
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

862
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,831
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

863
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:23,959
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...

864
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,587
... and for the very principles
this room was built upon.

865
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:30,298
We are at war, gentlemen.

866
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,260
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...

867
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,513
... in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.

868
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,225
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.

869
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,727
Send it for justice.

870
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:44,521
Send it for law and order.

871
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:47,274
Send it for reason.

872
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:51,528
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.

873
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:55,282
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.

874
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,536
That their courage bonds us together.

875
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,039
That we are made stronger
by their actions...

876
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:08,170
... and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

877
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,756
Three hundred.

878
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:15,927
We must send them.

879
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,558
Moving...

880
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,769
... eloquent, passionate.

881
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:29,357
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

882
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:31,943
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...

883
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,571
... and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.

884
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,490
The Persians will not stop...

885
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:40,035
... until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.

886
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:44,164
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.

887
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,875
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

888
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,127
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?

889
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,964
Honor. Duty. Glory.

890
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:58,261
You speak of honor, duty and glory?

891
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,805
But what of adultery?

892
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,433
- How dare you.
- How dare l?

893
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:06,895
Watch her carefully.

894
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:10,023
She is a trickster in true form.

895
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,360
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.

896
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,613
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.

897
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:21,243
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.

898
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:24,412
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!

899
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,582
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...

900
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,961
... in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?

901
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,921
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

902
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:36,841
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?

903
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:42,013
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?

904
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:48,144
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...

905
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,606
... while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

906
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,735
He speaks truth.

907
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,531
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...

908
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,783
... my little whore queen.

909
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:08,331
What queen-like behavior.

910
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:13,169
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...

911
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,339
... with her inglorious and shabby self.

912
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,764
This will not be over quickly.

913
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,644
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.

914
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,710
Traitor.

915
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:59,049
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

916
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,593
Traitor!

917
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:44,636
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.

918
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:48,473
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.

919
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,643
Despite your insufferable arrogance...

920
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:55,980
... the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.

921
01:34:56,732 --> 01:34:58,108
You will make a mighty ally.

922
01:34:58,275 --> 01:34:59,984
Yield, Leonidas.

923
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:04,030
Use your reason. Think of your men.

924
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,493
I beg you.

925
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,037
Listen to your fellow Greek.

926
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,916
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.

927
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:19,546
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...

928
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:23,633
... the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...

929
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,928
... and more, to reward your service.

930
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:28,513
You fight for your lands.

931
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,057
Keep them.

932
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:33,727
You fight for Sparta.

933
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:37,897
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.

934
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:40,024
You fight for your kingship.

935
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:43,903
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...

936
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:48,366
... answerable only
to the one true master of the world.

937
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:53,496
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...

938
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:56,249
... if you but lay down your arms...

939
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,586
... and kneel to holy Xerxes.

940
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:35,038
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.

941
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,751
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...

942
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:45,089
... only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.

943
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:50,678
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.

944
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,347
Gulls cawing...

945
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:56,726
... complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.

946
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:03,399
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...

947
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:07,654
... ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.

948
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,616
Every one of them...

949
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,036
... ready to die.

950
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,471
His helmet is stifling.

951
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,995
His shield is heavy.

952
01:38:04,628 --> 01:38:05,962
Your spear.

953
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:16,222
You there...

954
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,641
... Ephialtes.

955
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,024
May you live forever.

956
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,742
Leonidas, your spear.

957
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,560
Stelios!

958
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:56,197
Slaughter them!

959
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:01,160
His helmet was stifling.

960
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:04,455
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.

961
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:09,627
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...

962
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,464
... and his target is far away.

963
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:22,617
The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.

964
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:28,414
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.

965
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,710
His roar is long and loud.

966
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,408
My king.

967
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:20,299
It's an honor to die at your side.

968
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:26,389
It's an honor to have lived at yours.

969
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,412
My queen!

970
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:59,380
My wife.

971
01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:12,602
My love.

972
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:41,167
"Remember us."

973
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,255
As simple an order as a king can give.

974
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:51,052
"Remember why we died."

975
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:57,099
For he did not wish tribute or song...

976
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:03,105
... nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.

977
01:46:05,984 --> 01:46:08,277
His wish was simple.

978
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:15,743
"Remember us"...

979
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:18,496
... he said to me.

980
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:22,375
That was his hope.

981
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:26,295
Should any free soul
come across that place...

982
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:30,424
... in all the countless
centuries yet to be...

983
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:33,427
... may all our voices...

984
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:37,640
... whisper to you
from the ageless stones.

985
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:42,269
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...

986
01:46:42,604 --> 01:46:48,484
... that here, by Spartan law, we lie.

987
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,948
And so my king died...

988
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,451
... and my brothers died...

989
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,289
... barely a year ago.

990
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:11,465
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.

991
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,343
Time has proven him wise.

992
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:18,264
For from free Greek to free Greek...

993
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:23,018
... the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...

994
01:47:23,186 --> 01:47:25,187
... so far from home...

995
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:28,774
... laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...

996
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:32,736
... but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.

997
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:38,701
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...

998
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:43,873
... Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!

999
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:48,961
Just there the barbarians huddle...

1000
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:54,008
... sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...

1001
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:56,051
... with icy fingers...

1002
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:59,472
... knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...

1003
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,183
... at the swords and spears of 300.

1004
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:09,148
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...

1005
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:12,610
... commanding 30,000 free Greeks!

1006
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:23,329
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.

1007
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,623
Good odds for any Greek.

1008
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:31,045
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...

1009
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:35,591
... and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.

1010
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,514
Give thanks, men...

1011
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:45,976
... to Leonidas and the brave 300.

1012
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:48,896
To victory!

1013
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:28,063
