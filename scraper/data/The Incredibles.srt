1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,176
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,870
I can break through
walls, I just can't...

3
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,039
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,459
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,463
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,758
Who wants the pressure of
being super all the time?

7
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,887
Of course I have a
secret identity.

8
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,641
Can you see me in this at
the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,006
Who'd want to go shopping as
Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,858
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,069
Think it'll strengthen the
relationship or something.

12
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:15,491
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:20,121
I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,125
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,252
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:30,006
it always manages to get
back in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,551
Sometimes I just want it
to stay saved, you know?

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,971
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess."

19
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,640
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,434
I could
get to that point.

21
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,437
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,857
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,359
Relax a little and
raise a family.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,613
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,407
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,869
Leave the saving of the world to the men?
I don't think so.

27
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,246
I don't think so.

28
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,974
We interrupt
for a bulletin.

29
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,144
A high-speed pursuit between police
and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,647
traveling northbound
on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,237
Yeah, I've got time.

32
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,807
Mr. Incredible.

33
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,564
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

34
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,529
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

35
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,989
No, he's quite tame.

36
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,045
Let go now.

37
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,272
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

38
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,441
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

39
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,901
All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

40
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,446
Tour bus robbery.
I've still got time.

41
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,781
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

42
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,868
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...

43
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,537
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,205
What? No.

45
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,499
You're that kid
from the fan club.

46
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,252
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

47
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,171
My name is IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,339
I've been nice, I've
stood for photos,

49
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,009
signed every scrap of
paper you pushed at me...

50
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,720
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

51
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,765
crime fighting style, favorite
catch phrases, everything!

52
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,558
I'm your number one fan!

53
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,605
Hey! Hey, wait!

54
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,948
You know,

55
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,036
you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

56
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,081
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

57
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,165
Hey, look...

58
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,047
Elastigirl.

59
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,216
Mr. Incredible.

60
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,761
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

61
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,930
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

62
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,724
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

63
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,685
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

64
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,938
Thanks, but I don't
need any help.

65
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,981
Whatever happened
to "ladies first"?

66
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,275
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,945
Look, the lady got me first.

68
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,198
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

69
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,784
Well, I think you
need to be more

70
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,911
flexible.

71
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,330
Are you doing anything later?

72
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,791
I have a previous engagement.

73
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,179
Now, you just stay here.

74
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,224
They usually pick up the
garbage in an hour.

75
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,935
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,438
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

77
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,025
He's gonna jump!

78
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,250
I think you
broke something.

79
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,461
With counseling, I think
you'll come to forgive me.

80
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,338
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,995
Bomb Voyage.

82
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,997
Mr. Incredible...!

83
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,541
And IncrediBoy!

84
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,251
IncrediBoy?

85
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,131
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

86
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,799
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

87
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,967
Little oaf...!

88
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,427
Can we talk?

89
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,638
You always say be
true to yourself,

90
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,557
but you never say which
part to be true to.

91
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:18,437
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward. IncrediBoy!

92
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,565
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

93
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,859
This is because I don't
have powers, isn't it?

94
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,028
Not every superhero
has powers, you know.

95
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
You can be super without them.

96
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,450
I invented these. I can fly.
Can you fly?

97
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,786
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

98
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,579
And your outfit is
totally ridiculous!

99
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,958
Just give me one chance! I'll show you.
I'll go get the police.

100
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,293
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

101
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,712
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

102
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,925
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

103
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,886
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...

104
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,181
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

105
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:42,104
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

106
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,064
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

107
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,233
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

108
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,317
They picked him up.

109
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,820
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

110
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,447
who I caught robbing the vault.

111
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,074
We might nab him if we
set up a perimeter.

112
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,118
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

113
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,454
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

114
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,082
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

115
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,376
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

116
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,921
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

117
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:12,134
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

118
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,851
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

119
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,313
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,317
Showtime.

121
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,116
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

122
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,286
You're late. When you asked if
I was doing anything later,

123
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,706
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

124
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,167
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

125
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,753
You need to be more flexible.

126
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,255
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

127
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,508
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

128
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,635
You know that. Don't you?

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,221
So long as you both shall live?
I do.

130
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,182
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

131
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,480
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

132
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,734
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

133
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,824
In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

134
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,327
for saving someone who, apparently,
didn't want to be saved.

135
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,079
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

136
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,624
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

137
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,711
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

138
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,132
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

139
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,218
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

140
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,637
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

141
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,973
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

142
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,766
My client
has no comment.

143
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,479
Another suit was filed by
victims of the El train accident.

144
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,649
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

145
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,112
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

146
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,159
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

147
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Time for them to
join us, or go away.

148
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,248
Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

149
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,792
of an ever mounting
series of lawsuits,

150
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,921
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

151
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,466
The supers were granted amnesty from
responsibility for past actions,

152
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,888
in exchange for the promise to
never again resume hero work.

153
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,681
Where are they now?

154
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,019
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

155
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,441
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

156
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,403
Denied?
You're denying my claim?

157
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,032
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

158
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,284
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

159
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,288
but our liability is spelled
out in paragraph 17.

160
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,748
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

161
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,625
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

162
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,671
We're now officially moved in.

164
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,548
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

165
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,967
The last three years
don't count because...

166
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,096
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

167
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,598
Why do we
have so much junk?

168
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,183
Listen, I've got a client.

169
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,353
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

170
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,730
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

171
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
Bye, honey. Excuse me.
Where were we?

172
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:19,363
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

173
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,490
I don't know what I'll do.

174
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,584
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

175
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,296
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

176
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,341
Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

177
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,677
On the third floor. But I can't.

178
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,806
I also do not advise you to
fill out and file a WS2475 form

179
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,849
with our legal department
on the second floor.

180
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,186
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

181
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,605
I'd like to help, but
there's nothing I can do.

182
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,982
Oh, thank you, young man.

183
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,818
Sorry.
I know you're upset!

184
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,444
Pretend
to be upset.

185
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,367
Parr!

186
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,869
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

187
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,038
Someone broke into
their house, Mr. Huph.

188
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,208
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

189
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,129
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

190
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,423
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

191
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,885
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

192
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,057
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

193
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,647
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

194
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,068
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

195
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,323
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

196
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,783
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

197
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,911
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

198
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,789
Well... Not really. No.

199
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,999
Actually, not.

200
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,126
Oh, then how do you
know it was him?

201
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,754
I hid a camera. Yeah, and
this time, I've got him.

202
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,637
See? You see?

203
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,348
You don't see it?

204
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,935
He moves!
Right there!

205
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,439
Wait, wait! Right there!

206
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,149
Right as I'm sitting down!

207
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,942
I don't know how he does it,

208
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,278
but there's no tack
before he moves

209
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,491
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

210
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,413
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

211
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,624
This
little rat is guilty!

212
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,128
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

213
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,173
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

214
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,885
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

215
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,394
Dash, this is the third time this
year you've been sent to the office.

216
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,981
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

217
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,901
Maybe I could, if you'd
let me go out for sports.

218
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,112
Honey, you know why
we can't do that.

219
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,741
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

220
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,701
Dashiell Robert Parr,

221
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,288
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

222
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,499
The last thing you
need is temptation.

223
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,961
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

224
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,255
Why can't I do the
best that I can do?

225
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,966
Right now, honey, the world
just wants us to fit in,

226
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,593
and to fit in, we just gotta
be like everybody else.

227
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,596
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,267
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

229
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,978
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

230
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,031
Rydinger, where you headed?

231
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,619
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

232
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,457
- "Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
- That's kind of funny.

233
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,251
"Hey, Tony, do you
play football?"

234
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,423
Tony, I thought we
were gonna go swimming.

235
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,801
He looked at me.

236
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,722
Come on, Violet!

237
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,207
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

238
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,627
Oh, great.

239
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,540
Mom.

240
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,461
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

241
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,964
You make weird faces, honey.

242
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,467
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

243
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,554
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

244
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,765
Bob, could you help the
carnivore cut his meat?

245
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,104
Dash, you have something you wanna
tell your father about school?

246
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,273
Well, we
dissected a frog.

247
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,983
Dash got sent to
the office again.

248
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,610
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

249
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,863
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

250
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,657
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

251
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,451
He put a tack on the teacher's
chair, during class.

252
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,580
Nobody saw me. You could
barely see it on the tape.

253
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,874
They caught you on tape and you
still got away with it? Whoa!

254
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,419
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

255
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,878
We are not encouraging this.

256
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,214
I'm not, I'm just
asking how fast...

257
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,008
Honey!

258
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,263
Great. First the car, now I
gotta pay to fix the table...

259
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,056
What happened to the car?

260
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,102
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

261
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,272
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

262
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,191
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

263
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,903
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

264
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,948
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

265
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,743
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

266
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,787
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

267
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,540
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

268
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,877
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

269
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,589
She'd eat if we were
having Tony loaf.

270
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,382
That's it!

271
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,675
Stop it!

272
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,221
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

273
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,223
Sit down!

274
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,810
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

275
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,480
You sit down! You sit down!

276
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,939
Violet!

277
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,822
"Simon J. Paladino,

278
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,744
"longtime advocate of superhero
rights, is missing"?

279
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,540
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

280
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,001
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

281
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,046
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

282
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,964
Okay. I'm intervening!

283
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,677
Violet, let go of your brother.

284
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,595
Hello?

285
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,223
Get the door.

286
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,102
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

287
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,049
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

288
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,816
Lucius!

289
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,942
Whoa!

290
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,530
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

291
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,241
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

292
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,868
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

293
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,205
Bowling night. Say hello
to Honey for me, Lucius.

294
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,999
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

295
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,215
Don't think you've avoided talking
about the principal's office.

296
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,384
Your father and I are
still gonna discuss it.

297
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,220
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

298
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,222
Other kids don't
have superpowers.

299
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,351
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

300
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,812
What does anyone in this
family know about normal?

301
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,691
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

302
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,611
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

303
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,906
Lucky.

304
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,492
I meant about being normal.

305
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,913
So now I'm
in deep trouble.

306
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,250
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

307
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,795
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

308
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,423
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

309
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,469
He starts this prepared speech about
how feeble I am compared to him.

310
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,848
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

311
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,183
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

312
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,603
I mean, the guy has me on
a platter, and he won't shut up.

313
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,938
Municiberg,
we have a 23-56...

314
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,565
23-56, what is that?

315
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,609
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

316
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,819
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

317
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,197
Tell you the truth, I'd
rather go bowling.

318
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,784
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

319
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,411
Just to shake things up.

320
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,124
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

321
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,585
They're just talking.

322
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,796
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

323
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,132
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

324
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,802
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

325
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,306
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

326
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,643
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

327
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,313
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

328
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,607
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

329
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,485
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

330
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,988
- We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

331
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,741
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

332
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,163
Fire! Yeah!

333
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,423
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

334
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,262
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

335
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,598
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

336
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,809
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

337
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,186
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

338
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,689
You can't run out. You can
use water in the air.

339
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,526
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

340
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,529
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

341
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,782
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

342
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,163
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

343
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,177
Yeah.

344
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,308
Uh-oh.

345
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,976
Oh, good.

346
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,646
That ain't right.

347
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,485
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

348
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,570
Freeze!

349
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,912
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

350
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,832
I'm just getting a drink.

351
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,841
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

352
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,429
Police officers!

353
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,276
That was way too close.

354
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,071
We are not doing that again.

355
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,618
Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

356
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,205
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

357
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,567
- I thought you'd be back by 11:00.
- I said I'd be back later.

358
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,320
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all,

359
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:53,408
- you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

360
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,083
Is this rubble?

361
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,586
It was just a
little workout. Just to stay loose.

362
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,340
You know how I feel about that. Darn you!
We can't blow cover again.

363
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,217
The building was
coming down anyway.

364
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,510
What?

365
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,178
You knocked down a building?

366
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,306
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

367
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,767
Have you been listening to
the police scanner again?

368
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,895
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

369
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,397
It is a bad thing, Bob!

370
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,651
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

371
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,612
It's better than acting
like they didn't happen!

372
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,532
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

373
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,077
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

374
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,330
I can't believe you don't want to
go to your own son's graduation.

375
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,417
It's not a graduation. He's moving
from fourth to fifth grade.

376
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,586
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

377
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,422
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

378
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,424
but if someone is exceptional...

379
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,760
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

380
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,721
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

381
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,599
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

382
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,185
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

383
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,437
This is not about you!

384
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,067
All right, Dash. I know you're listening.
Come on out.

385
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,403
Vi?
You, too, young lady.

386
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,864
Come on. Come on out.

387
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,242
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

388
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,077
Pretty loud discussion.

389
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,790
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

390
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:29,754
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

391
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,381
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

392
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,134
Everything's okay. Go back to bed.
It's late.

393
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,969
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

394
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,515
In fact, we should
all be in bed.

395
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,324
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

396
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,618
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

397
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,663
Mr. Huph would like to
talk to you in his office.

398
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,873
- Now?
- Now.

399
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,643
Sit down, Bob.

400
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,361
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

401
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,990
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

402
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,867
Why what?
Be specific, Bob.

403
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,618
Why are you unhappy?

404
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,495
Your customers make me unhappy.

405
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,330
What, you've gotten complaints?

406
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,874
Complaints I can handle.

407
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,586
What I can't handle is your
customers' inexplicable knowledge

408
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,631
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

409
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,718
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

410
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,345
They're penetrating
the bureaucracy!

411
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,181
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

412
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:08,519
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

413
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,939
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

414
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,858
Starting with our stockholders.

415
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,360
Who's helping them out, huh?

416
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,783
You know,
Bob, a company...

417
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,118
Is like an enormous clock.

418
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:28,205
Is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

419
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,544
It only works if all the
little cogs mesh together.

420
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:38,841
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

421
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:43,930
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

422
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,182
I'm being
metaphorical, Bob.

423
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,768
Know what I mean by
cooperative cogs?

424
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,561
Bob?

425
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,981
Bob? Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Parr.

426
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,068
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

427
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,237
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

428
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,865
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

429
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,494
Stop right now or you're fired!

430
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,165
Close the door.

431
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,252
Get over here, now.

432
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,551
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

433
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,264
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

434
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,976
You were this close
to losing your...

435
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,361
Uh-oh.

436
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,700
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

437
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,874
- How is he?
- He'll live.

438
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,793
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

439
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,045
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

440
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,423
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

441
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,342
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

442
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,636
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

443
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,055
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

444
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,641
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

445
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,811
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

446
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,564
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

447
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,651
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

448
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,071
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

449
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:31,620
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate
you, you know, for old times' sake.

450
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,999
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

451
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,334
I'll make it work. Thanks.

452
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,420
Take care of yourself.

453
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,809
What are you waiting for?

454
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,938
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

455
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,357
Me, too, kid.

456
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,132
Huh?

457
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,396
"Hold still"?

458
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,857
Match, Mr. Incredible.

459
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,283
Room is secure.
Commence message.

460
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,746
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

461
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,749
Rest assured, your
secret is safe with us.

462
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,336
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

463
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,090
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

464
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,678
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

465
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,222
I represent a top secret
division of the government,

466
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,474
designing and testing
experimental technology,

467
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,811
and we have need of
your unique abilities.

468
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,105
Something happened at
our testing facility.

469
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

470
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,525
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

471
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,153
It is contained within
an isolated area,

472
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,574
it threatens to 'cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

473
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,410
jeopardizing hundreds of
millions of dollars...

474
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,078
Is someone in there?

475
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,415
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

476
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,793
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

477
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,797
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

478
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,718
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

479
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,680
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

480
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,684
You can still do great things.
Or

481
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,937
you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

482
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,981
You have 24 hours to respond.

483
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,691
Think about it.

484
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,689
This message
will self-destruct.

485
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,815
Uh-oh.

486
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,544
You are one distracted guy.

487
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,463
Am I?
I don't mean to be.

488
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:15,261
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

489
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:20,057
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

490
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,726
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

491
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,062
- Something's happened.
- What?

492
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,772
- The, uh...
- What?

493
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,483
The company is sending
me to, uh, a conference.

494
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,735
- A conference?
- Out of town.

495
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,320
I'm gonna be gone
for a few days.

496
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,950
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

497
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,076
Yes.

498
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,288
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

499
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,914
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

500
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,126
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

501
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,421
Hello?

502
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,506
This is Mr. Incredible.

503
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,341
I'm in.

504
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,727
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top
secret prototype battle robot.

505
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,230
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

506
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,191
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

507
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,820
Let me guess. It got smart enough to
wonder why it had to take orders.

508
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,991
We lost control. Now it's loose in the
jungle, threatening our facility.

509
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,244
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

510
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,329
How am I going in?

511
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,291
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5,000 feet.

512
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,794
Its cloaking devices make
it difficult to track.

513
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,006
We're pretty sure it's on the
Southern half of the island.

514
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,052
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

515
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,512
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

516
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,140
You are Mr. Incredible.

517
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,828
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

518
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,665
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

519
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,918
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

520
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,505
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

521
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,245
Showtime.

522
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,332
Huh?

523
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,878
Hmm.

524
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,352
Uh-oh.

525
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,624
Oh, my back!

526
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,188
Oh!

527
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,862
Surprising. We must
bring him back.

528
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,782
Sound the all clear, and
invite him to dinner.

529
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,429
Most
important, keep things light.

530
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,433
Praise him. Make him feel like
we appreciate his abilities.

531
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,061
Am I overdressed?

532
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,730
Actually, you look
rather dashing.

533
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,858
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

534
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,111
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

535
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,990
Of course. I do usually make it a
point to know who I'm working for.

536
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,077
He prefers a certain
amount of anonymity.

537
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,496
Surely, you of all
people understand that.

538
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,250
I was just wondering, of all the
places to settle down, why live...

539
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:06,630
With a volcano?
He's attracted to power. So am I.

540
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,509
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

541
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,804
I prefer to think of
it as misunderstood.

542
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,472
Aren't we all?

543
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,266
Volcanic soil is among the
most fertile on Earth.

544
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,478
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

545
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,816
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

546
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,901
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

547
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,320
Or you'll be late for work.

548
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,782
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

549
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,743
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

550
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,870
All that jazz.

551
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,879
You have an appointment?

552
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,798
I'm an old friend.
I just wanted to...

553
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,802
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

554
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,929
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

555
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,226
My God, you've gotten fat.
Come in. Come, come.

556
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:36,238
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

557
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,617
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

558
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,495
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

559
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,914
Milan, darling. Milan.

560
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,960
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

561
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,212
Spoiled, stupid,
little stick figures

562
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,840
with poofy lips who think
only about themselves.

563
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,844
Feh!
I used to design for gods.

564
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:05,016
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh?
I was surprised to get your call.

565
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,435
E, I just need a patch job.

566
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,814
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

567
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,443
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

568
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,113
Moonlighting hero work?

569
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,031
Must have happened
a long time ago.

570
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,159
I see. This is a
hobo suit, darling.

571
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,745
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

572
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,000
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

573
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,211
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

574
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,922
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

575
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,508
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

576
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,011
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

577
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,305
So ask me now, before
I again become sane.

578
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,266
Wait. You want to
make me a suit?

579
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,686
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

580
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,856
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

581
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,149
Heroic!

582
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,861
Yeah, something
classic, like Dynaguy!

583
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,615
Oh! He had a great look! Oh,
the cape and the boots...

584
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,741
No capes!

585
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,913
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

586
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,749
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

587
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,127
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

588
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,672
All was well,
another day saved

589
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,550
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.

590
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,969
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

591
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,054
Stratogale!

592
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:29,434
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

593
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,811
You can't generalize
about these things.

594
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,190
Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

595
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,069
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

596
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,572
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

597
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,699
You know I'm retired
from hero work.

598
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,036
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

599
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,499
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

600
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,670
Fine. I will
also fix the hobo suit.

601
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,341
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

602
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,648
Don't answer it,
honey, I got it!

603
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,484
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

604
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:26,509
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

605
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,284
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

606
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,790
Who was that, honey?
The, uh, office?

607
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,793
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

608
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,712
duty calls.

609
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,555
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

610
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

611
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,812
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

612
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,066
- So much.
- I love you, too.

613
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,165
This is
your automated Captain.

614
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,418
Would you care for more mimosa?

615
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,671
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

616
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,969
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

617
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,687
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

618
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,715
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

619
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,091
Thanks.

620
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,928
Nice to be back, Mirage.

621
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,457
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

622
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,961
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

623
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,546
See you there.

624
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,496
Edna.

625
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,457
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

626
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,252
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

627
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,589
Helen Parr?
You know...

628
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,841
Elastigirl?

629
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,137
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

630
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
It's been a while.

631
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,576
There's only one
person Bob would trust

632
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,309
to patch his supersuit.
That's you.

633
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,352
Yes, yes, yes.
Marvelous, isn't it?

634
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,606
Much better than those horrible
pajamas he used to wear.

635
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,191
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

636
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,360
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

637
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,945
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

638
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,656
No, I'm calling about suit.

639
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,492
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

640
00:49:56,577 --> 00:50:00,371
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

641
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,886
Hmm.

642
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,112
It's bigger!

643
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,491
It's badder!

644
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:43,081
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
too much for Mr. Incredible!

645
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,876
It's finally ready.

646
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,339
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

647
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,884
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

648
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,972
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

649
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,141
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

650
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,396
I mean, after all, I
am your biggest fan.

651
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,984
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

652
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,820
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

653
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,365
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

654
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,702
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

655
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,454
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

656
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,291
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

657
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,335
You can't count on anyone.

658
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,337
Especially your heroes.

659
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,716
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

660
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,219
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

661
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,762
That's the way it works.

662
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,598
There's a lot of people, whole
countries who want respect.

663
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,268
And they will pay through
the nose to get it.

664
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,937
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

665
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,066
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

666
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,946
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

667
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,865
I can't believe it.

668
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:06,080
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

669
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
Am I good enough now?

670
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,794
Who's super now?

671
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm Syndrome!
Your Nemesis and...

672
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,633
Oh, brilliant!

673
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,071
All right, try this one
on for size, big boy.

674
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,274
Gazerbeam.

675
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,621
Kronos?

676
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,651
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

677
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,367
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

678
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,705
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

679
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,084
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

680
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,003
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

681
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,631
and it turned out so
beautiful, I had to continue.

682
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,510
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

683
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,888
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

684
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,891
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

685
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,059
That is why I show you my work.

686
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,853
That is why you are here.

687
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,695
Edna Mode.

688
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,448
And guest.

689
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,091
Come. Sit.

690
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,806
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

691
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

692
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,730
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

693
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,733
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

694
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,738
And can also withstand a
temperature of over 1000 degrees.

695
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,909
Completely bulletproof.

696
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

697
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,875
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

698
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,088
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

699
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,341
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

700
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,969
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

701
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,845
Well, he'll look
fabulous anyway.

702
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,893
Your boy's suit I designed to
withstand enormous friction

703
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,563
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

704
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

705
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:08,447
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

706
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:16,372
Your suit can stretch as far as you
can, without injuring yourself,

707
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,499
and still retain its shape.

708
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,544
Virtually indestructible,

709
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,298
yet it breathes like
Egyptian cotton.

710
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,968
As an extra feature, each suit
contains a homing device,

711
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,306
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

712
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,435
Well, darling?
What do you think?

713
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,064
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

714
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,649
Our family is underground.

715
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,902
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

716
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,530
Well, I assumed you
knew, darling.

717
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,491
Why would he keep
secrets from you?

718
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,202
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

719
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,206
Men at Robert's age
are often unstable.

720
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,752
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

721
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,379
Do you know where he is?

722
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,382
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

723
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,018
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

724
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,442
Are you okay?
What happened?

725
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,114
Break surveillance and engage.
Continuing sweep...

726
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,343
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

727
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,970
Bob Parr is my husband.

728
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,306
I was wondering if you could give me the
number of the hotel he's staying at?

729
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:48,769
- The number I have is no good.
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.

730
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,147
What do you mean? He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

731
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,276
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

732
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,934
So, you don't know where he is.

733
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,273
Would you like to find out?

734
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:55,687
I am such an idiot.
I let this happen, you know.

735
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,401
The new sports car, the getting in
shape, the blond hair, the lies.

736
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,362
Yes, he attempts to
relive the past.

737
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,825
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

738
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,369
What are you talking about?

739
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:16,083
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

740
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,252
What will you do?
Is this a question?

741
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,796
Show him you remember that
he is Mr. Incredible,

742
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,841
and you will remind
him who you are!

743
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:28,220
Well, you know where he is. Go!
Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

744
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,224
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

745
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,893
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

746
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,314
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

747
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,275
I should be back tonight. Late.

748
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,734
You can be in charge
that long, can't you?

749
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,988
Yeah. But why am I
in charge again?

750
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,490
Nothing. Just a little
trouble with Daddy.

751
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:52,870
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

752
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:56,790
I mean either he's in
trouble, or he's going to be.

753
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,966
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

754
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,177
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

755
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,678
We all get cool outfits?

756
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,764
Dash! You come back
here this moment!

757
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,686
Hey, Snug.
Thanks for getting back.

758
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,564
I know this is short notice, but
I was hoping that I could...

759
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,609
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

760
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,445
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

761
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,699
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

762
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,577
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

763
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,871
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

764
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:39,291
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

765
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,837
What makes you think
it's special?

766
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,673
I don't know.
Why'd Mom try to hide it?

767
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,602
Snug, I'm calling in
a solid you owe me.

768
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:02,314
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

769
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,483
Let me think.

770
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,286
Island approach. India Golf
niner-niner checking in.

771
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,080
VFR on top. Over.

772
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,794
Island tower, this is
India Golf niner-niner

773
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,213
requesting vectors
to the initial.

774
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,142
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

775
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:43,480
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

776
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,610
At the same time. Yeah.

777
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:07,379
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

778
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,299
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

779
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,344
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

780
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,847
I'm still geeking out about it!

781
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,685
And then you had to just
go and ruin the ride.

782
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:26,690
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

783
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,234
Lame, lame, lame.

784
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,736
All right, who did you contact?

785
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,655
Contact? What are
you talking about?

786
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,830
I am referring to last
night at 23:07 hours

787
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,042
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

788
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,086
I didn't know about
the homing device.

789
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,637
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

790
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,721
Who did you contact?

791
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,848
I didn't send for a plane.

792
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,850
Play the transmission.

793
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,480
- India Golf checking in.
- Helen!

794
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,650
So you do know these people.

795
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,861
Well, then, I'll send
them a little greeting.

796
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,366
- Ow!
- Violet!

797
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,909
It's not my fault.

798
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,036
Dash ran away, I knew
I'd get blamed for it.

799
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,954
That's not true!

800
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,479
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

801
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,378
and it's not my fault!
Hundred percent allyours idea!

802
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,297
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

803
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,509
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

804
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,886
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

805
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,764
All right, well, who'd you get?

806
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,225
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

807
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,603
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

808
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,273
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

809
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,567
I brought Mozart to
play while he sleeps

810
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,529
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

811
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:56,822
- Kari...
- The beauty is

812
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,574
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

813
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,743
I wish my parents played Mozart

814
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,830
because half the time I don't
know what anyone's talking about.

815
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,542
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

816
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,545
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

817
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,588
There's really no
need, Mrs. Parr.

818
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,383
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

819
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,219
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

820
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,221
Who can handle it?

821
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,440
India Golf niner-niner
transmitting in the blind guard.

822
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,693
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

823
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,765
Repeat, disengage.

824
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,058
- Friendlies...
- No!

825
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,704
Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

826
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,063
Too late.
Fifteen years too late.

827
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,943
Friendlies two-zero Miles
South-southwest of your position.

828
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,321
Angels 10. Track east.
Disengage.

829
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,948
Vi! Put a force field
around the plane.

830
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,783
You said not to use our powers.

831
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,328
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

832
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,455
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

833
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,294
Mom?

834
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:35,921
Violet!

835
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,424
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

836
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,009
There are children aboard.

837
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,802
- There are children aboard!
- No!

838
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,097
Put a field around us now!

839
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,641
I've never done one that big.

840
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:48,808
Do it now!

841
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:55,690
Abort, abort, abort!

842
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,640
Brace yourselves!

843
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,941
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

844
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,734
I'll tell you what
we're not gonna do.

845
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,404
We're not gonna panic, we're not...
Look out!

846
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,334
- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

847
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,920
We're dead!
We're dead!

848
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,923
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

849
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,341
Stop it!

850
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,719
We are not gonna die!

851
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,762
Both of you will get a grip.

852
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,265
Or so help me I will
ground you for a month!

853
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,850
Understand?

854
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,771
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

855
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,898
Ah, you'll get over it.

856
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:22,569
I seem to recall you
prefer to "work alone."

857
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,706
Release me. Now!

858
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,291
Or what?

859
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,917
I'll crush her.

860
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,837
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

861
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,798
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

862
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,884
Show me.

863
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,523
I knew you
couldn't do it.

864
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,360
Even when you have
nothing to lose.

865
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:04,903
You're weak.

866
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,697
And I've outgrown you.

867
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:21,378
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

868
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,380
That way is our best bet.

869
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,257
You want to go toward the
people that tried to kill us?

870
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,345
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

871
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,264
I expect you to trust me.

872
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,494
What a trooper.

873
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,122
I'm so proud of you.

874
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,040
Thanks, Mom.

875
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,591
I think your father
is in trouble.

876
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,677
If you haven't noticed, we're
not doing so hot either.

877
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,262
I'm going to look for him.

878
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,140
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

879
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,476
- What?
- You heard her.

880
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:05,482
Put these on. Your identity is
your most valuable possession.

881
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,816
Protect it.

882
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,985
And if anything goes
wrong, use your powers.

883
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:12,322
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

884
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,576
Remember the bad guys

885
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,454
on those shows you used to
watch on Saturday mornings?

886
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:23,041
Well, these guys are
not like those guys.

887
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,836
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

888
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,173
They will kill you if
they get the chance.

889
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,550
Do not give them that chance.

890
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,385
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

891
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,597
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

892
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:43,019
Dash, if anything goes wrong, I
want you to run as fast as you can.

893
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,939
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

894
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:49,651
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

895
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,240
Mom!

896
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,785
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

897
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,830
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

898
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,249
Shh. It isn't your fault.

899
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,919
It wasn't fair for me to
suddenly ask so much of you.

900
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,505
But things are different now.

901
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,633
And doubt is a luxury we can't
afford anymore, sweetie.

902
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,052
You have more power
than you realize.

903
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,888
Don't think. And don't worry.

904
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,474
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

905
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,143
It's in your blood.

906
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,809
- He's not weak, you know.
- What?

907
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,186
Valuing life is not weakness.

908
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,065
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

909
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,859
I had everything under control.

910
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,820
And disregarding it
is not strength.

911
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,656
I called his bluff,
sweetheart, that's all.

912
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,242
I knew he wouldn't have
it in him to actually...

913
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:24,078
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

914
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,678
Okay, okay, okay.

915
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,568
A rocket?

916
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Hey!

917
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:35,603
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

918
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,438
What do you think
is going on here?

919
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,649
You think we're on vacation?

920
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,860
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

921
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,196
Or worse,
their marriage.

922
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,073
Their marriage?

923
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,869
So, the bad guys are trying to
wreck Mom and Dad's marriage.

924
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,122
Forget it. You're so immature.

925
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,416
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

926
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:01,337
I'm not gonna leave the cave.
Sheesh.

927
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,379
Cool!

928
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,842
Roger.
We are ready for launch.

929
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,272
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

930
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,953
ETA two-niner.
Over.

931
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:22,210
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

932
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,006
Not responding to IFF.

933
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,883
IRCM reads negative.

934
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,053
- Bob.
- What?

935
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,387
I didn't say anything.

936
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,377
Identification, please.

937
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,170
Hey!

938
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:09,257
- Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks!
- What? What?

939
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,800
There. That one.

940
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,510
Voice key incorrect.

941
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,178
"Voice key"?

942
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,931
Voice key incorrect.

943
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,683
Wait a second.

944
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,353
- What do we do?
- Run!

945
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,522
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

946
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:32,947
Intruder alert.

947
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,305
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

948
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,807
In fact, there's no time at all.

949
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,018
- Please...
- Why are you here?

950
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:07,106
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

951
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:10,735
Family
survived the crash.

952
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,820
They're here on the island!

953
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,280
They're alive?

954
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,795
- Helen?
- Hello.

955
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,048
You must be Mrs...

956
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,217
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

957
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:38,262
That's what I was doing.
Let go of me!

958
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,432
Let go, you lousy,
lying, unfaithful creep!

959
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,353
How could I betray
the perfect woman?

960
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,271
Oh, you're referring to me now?

961
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,522
Where are the kids?

962
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,399
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

963
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,861
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

964
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,746
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

965
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:59,367
They stowed away. You're not
striking the proper tone.

966
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,788
Think they're supers?

967
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,212
Dash, remember what Mom said.

968
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,797
- What?
- Stop talking!

969
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,050
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

970
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,843
- What?
- Run!

971
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,055
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

972
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:23,974
Show yourself!

973
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,036
Hey!

974
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,920
Ha, ha!

975
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,897
I'm alive. Yeah!

976
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,900
Uh-oh.

977
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,764
I should've told you I
was fired, I admit it.

978
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,140
But I didn't want you to worry.

979
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,559
You didn't want me to worry?

980
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,520
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

981
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,815
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

982
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:23,153
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

983
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,543
You can't hide from me.

984
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,968
- There you are.
- Hey!

985
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,932
Don't touch my sister!

986
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,942
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

987
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,694
Whatever you do, don't stop!

988
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,212
Mom! Dad! Hey!

989
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:25,132
Kids.

990
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,009
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

991
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,595
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

992
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,448
I love you.

993
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:51,033
- Wow. 
- Whoa.

994
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,091
Time out!

995
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,054
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

996
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:16,475
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

997
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,313
You married Elastigirl?
Whoa!

998
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,817
And got busy!

999
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:29,488
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

1000
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:32,157
Oh, this is just too good!

1001
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:35,703
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

1002
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:40,791
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

1003
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,211
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

1004
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:47,047
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

1005
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:51,844
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

1006
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,763
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

1007
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:59,017
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

1008
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,854
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

1009
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:05,983
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

1010
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,234
I'll give them heroics.

1011
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:10,738
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

1012
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,991
And when I'm old and I've had
my fun, I'll sell my inventions

1013
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:18,412
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

1014
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:21,331
And when
everyone's super

1015
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:26,170
no one will be.

1016
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:53,572
Fire at will!

1017
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,707
It's
overwhelming the tanks.

1018
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

1019
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:09,254
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1020
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:13,133
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1021
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,136
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1022
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:17,346
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1023
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,140
So caught up in the
past that I...

1024
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:26,146
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1025
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,315
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1026
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,402
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1027
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,155
but I think it's time
we wind down now.

1028
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:40,035
We need to get back
to the mainland.

1029
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:42,788
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1030
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:53,924
Where are all the guards?

1031
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,968
Go, go!

1032
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:03,267
Hey, every time
they run, you take a shot.

1033
01:32:19,397 --> 01:32:21,678
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1034
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:24,204
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1035
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,206
How about a rocket?

1036
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:34,006
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1037
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,800
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1038
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,264
Wait. I bet Syndrome's
changed the password by now.

1039
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:45,142
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

1040
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:03,076
- Honey?
- What?

1041
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,995
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1042
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:08,749
Where is my supersuit?

1043
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,919
- I put it away.
- Where?

1044
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:15,339
- Why do you need to know?
- I need it!

1045
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:18,425
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1046
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,385
We've been planning this
dinner for two months!

1047
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,847
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1048
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:27,434
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1049
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:29,686
"Greater good"?
I am your wife!

1050
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:32,689
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1051
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,778
Run!

1052
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,864
My baby!

1053
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:47,913
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1054
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:51,249
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1055
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:56,296
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1056
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:01,134
All right, stand back.

1057
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:09,267
Someone needs to teach this
hunk of metal a few manners.

1058
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:12,312
Ha, ha!

1059
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:42,801
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1060
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,264
How you doing, honey?

1061
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,891
Do I have to answer?

1062
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,355
Kids, strap yourselves
down like I told you.

1063
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,403
Here we go, honey.

1064
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:03,113
Ready, Violet?

1065
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,116
Ready? Now!

1066
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:11,455
This is gonna be rough.

1067
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,214
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1068
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:22,924
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1069
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:24,889
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1070
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,722
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1071
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,599
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1072
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:32,309
Get in the right Lane! Signal!

1073
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:33,935
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1074
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,840
Is everybody okay back there?

1075
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:07,677
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1076
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,558
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1077
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:17,145
While what? I watch helplessly
from the sidelines?

1078
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,689
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1079
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,442
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1080
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,361
I'm with you for
better or worse.

1081
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,446
I have to do this alone.

1082
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,448
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1083
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,408
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1084
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:31,743
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1085
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:33,829
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1086
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,956
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1087
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,083
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1088
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:40,085
I can't lose you again!

1089
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:44,381
I can't. Not again.

1090
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,967
I'm not strong enough.

1091
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:58,478
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1092
01:36:58,563 --> 01:36:59,771
I don't know what'll happen.

1093
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,858
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1094
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,281
Vi! Dash! No!

1095
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,167
Violet?

1096
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,922
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1097
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:39,102
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1098
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,531
Frozone!

1099
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,824
Yeah!

1100
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,703
Bob!

1101
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,080
Hey!

1102
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:16,640
Syndrome's remote!

1103
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:27,734
The remote controls the robot!

1104
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,322
Throw it, throw it!

1105
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,657
Go long!

1106
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,086
Got it!

1107
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:52,926
Honey, take out its guns!

1108
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:01,268
Gotcha!

1109
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,024
Mom, I've got it!
I've got the remote!

1110
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,403
A remote? A remote
that controls what?

1111
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,449
The robot?

1112
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:06,875
It's coming back!

1113
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,654
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1114
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,426
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

1115
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,431
itself.

1116
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:22,724
It's getting closer!

1117
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:24,934
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1118
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,021
It's not
doing anything.

1119
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,145
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1120
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:37,113
Honey!

1121
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,413
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1122
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,542
No, the other one!
The first one!

1123
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:50,835
First button!
Got it!

1124
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,545
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1125
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:56,132
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1126
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:57,967
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1127
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:00,553
- Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

1128
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,972
A closer target!
You got one shot!

1129
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:07,018
Everybody duck!

1130
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,210
Hey, Zone.

1131
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:40,343
Huh? No!

1132
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:44,514
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1133
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:48,768
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1134
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:54,607
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1135
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,985
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

1136
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,699
We've frozen all of
Syndrome's assets.

1137
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:06,786
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1138
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,913
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1139
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,623
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1140
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,750
Let the politicians
figure that one out.

1141
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:16,463
I've been asked to assure you we'll
take care of everything else.

1142
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:17,547
You did good, Bob.

1143
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:23,136
Hi, this is Kari. I have a
question about Jack-Jack...

1144
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,596
Come on. We're in a limo.

1145
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,640
Hey, you're wearing
your hair back?

1146
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:30,560
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

1147
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:33,313
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1148
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,648
Not as cool as you
running on water.

1149
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:39,527
That was sweet when you snagged
that bad guy with your arm

1150
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,238
and whiplashed him into
the other guy. Sweet!

1151
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:44,991
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.

1152
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:48,328
Jack-Jack is fine, but weird
things are happening.

1153
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:52,040
Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm
getting really weirded out!

1154
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,125
When are you coming back?

1155
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,628
Aced those guys that
tried to kill us!

1156
01:42:56,712 --> 01:43:00,840
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1157
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:03,510
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1158
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,513
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1159
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,598
I need help, Mrs...

1160
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,308
Bob, listen to this.

1161
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:12,435
I'm gonna
call the police...

1162
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:14,521
Hi, this is Kari.

1163
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:18,608
Sorry for freaking out, but
your baby has special needs.

1164
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,944
Thanks for sending
a replacement.

1165
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,238
I didn't call a replacement.

1166
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:31,079
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1167
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:36,000
You took away my future.

1168
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:39,462
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1169
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:42,757
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1170
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:46,511
And in time, who knows, he
might make a good sidekick.

1171
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:54,310
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1172
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,244
What's happening?

1173
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:20,336
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1174
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:25,925
Throw me.

1175
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:31,764
Bob, throw me!

1176
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,022
No!

1177
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:44,569
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1178
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:46,029
I'll get your son!

1179
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,365
Oh, no.

1180
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:03,755
Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down.
Mommy's got you.

1181
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,591
Everything is all right.

1182
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,858
That's my girl.

1183
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:26,819
Does this mean we
have to move again?

1184
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,866
Oh, man.

1185
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:34,619
That was totally wicked!

1186
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:54,347
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1187
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:57,350
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1188
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:58,893
- Hey.
- Hey.

1189
01:45:58,977 --> 01:46:01,688
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1190
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,731
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1191
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:07,402
I feel different.
Is different okay?

1192
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:10,780
Hey, different is... Different is great.

1193
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,824
Would you...

1194
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,575
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1195
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,369
- you and I...
- Yeah?

1196
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:17,787
- Do you...
- Shh.

1197
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:21,165
I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn.
Okay?

1198
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:24,210
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1199
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:27,004
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1200
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:34,554
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1201
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:37,557
Come on, run!
Pick up the pace.

1202
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:38,683
Run!

1203
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:40,143
Pull back, pull back!

1204
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:42,770
Pace it. Slow down
just a little bit.

1205
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,897
- Make it close!
- Second.

1206
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:47,650
Close
second, yeah!

1207
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,948
That's my boy!

1208
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:55,992
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1209
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,956
I didn't know what the
heck you wanted me to do.

1210
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:14,010
Behold the Underminer!

1211
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:17,138
I am
always beneath you,

1212
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,183
but nothing is beneath me!

1213
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:26,230
I hereby declare
war on peace and happiness!

1214
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:34,940
Soon all will tremble before me!
