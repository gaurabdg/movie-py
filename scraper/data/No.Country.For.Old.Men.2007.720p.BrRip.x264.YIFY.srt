1
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:41,889
<i>I was sheriff of this
county when I was 25 years old.</i>

2
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,824
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

3
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:48,262
<i>My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.</i>

4
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:53,167
<i>Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.</i>

5
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:55,569
<i>I think he's pretty
proud of that.</i>

6
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,172
<i>I know I was.</i>

7
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,527
<i>Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.</i>

8
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,681
<i>Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.</i>

9
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:08,282
<i>That's the younger Jim.</i>

10
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,837
<i>Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear
one up in Comanche County.</i>

11
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:16,473
<i>I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.</i>

12
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,110
<i>Never missed a chance to do so.</i>

13
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:23,797
<i>You can't help but compare
yourself against the old-timers.</i>

14
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Can't help but wonder how they'd
have operated these times.</i>

15
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:32,874
<i>There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.</i>

16
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,627
<i>My arrest and my testimony.</i>

17
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:41,031
<i>He killed a 14-year-old girl.</i>

18
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,467
<i>Paper said it was
a crime of passion,</i>

19
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,370
<i>but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.</i>

20
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:50,791
<i>Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.</i>

21
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:53,661
<i>Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.</i>

22
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:56,513
<i>Said he knew
he was going to hell.</i>

23
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,883
<i>Be there in about 15 minutes.</i>

24
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,786
<i>I don't know
what to make of that.</i>

25
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:05,289
<i>I sure do don't.</i>

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,793
<i>The crime you see now, it's
hard to even take its measure.</i>

27
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:13,498
<i>It's not that I'm afraid of it.</i>

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,302
<i>I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.</i>

29
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:22,673
<i>But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out</i>

30
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:26,610
<i>and meet something
I don't understand.</i>

31
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:33,217
<i>A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.</i>

32
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,854
<i>He'd have to say, "OK.</i>

33
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,076
<i>I'll be part of this world."</i>

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,281
Yes, sir, I just walked
in the door.

35
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:49,317
He had some sort
of thing on him,

36
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:52,953
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

37
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:55,289
and a hose that
run down his sleeve.

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,958
<i>Oxygen tank? What the
hell's he got that for?</i>

39
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,761
You got me. Well, you can
look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:05,399
<i>- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.</i>

41
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:46,183
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

42
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,568
What is that?

43
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,354
I need you to step
out of the car, sir.

44
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,480
- What is that for?
- Would you...?

45
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:03,000
Would you hold still please,
sir?

46
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:35,015
You hold still.

47
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:45,960
Shit.

48
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,270
<i>Agua.</i>

49
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,306
<i>Agua.</i>

50
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,154
<i>Agua.</i>

51
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,908
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,778
<i>Agua.</i>

53
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,705
<i>Agua.</i>

54
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,158
<i>I told you I ain't got no agua.</i>

55
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,457
Do you speak English?

56
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,178
Where's the last guy?

57
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,400
<i> ltimo hombre, last man standing.
There must have been one. Where'd he go?</i>

58
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:29,576
I reckon I go out
the way I come in.

59
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,215
<i>Hay lobos.</i>

60
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:37,484
<i>There ain't no lobos.</i>

61
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:55,035
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

62
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,872
Now shoot my dumb ass.

63
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,644
But if you stop,

64
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,880
you stopped in shade.

65
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:11,087
Yeah.

66
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:20,214
Hmm.

67
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:23,150
Mmm.

68
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:19,639
<i>My place is wrong?</i>

69
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,576
<i>Yours is the first place Danzer
and Dora will look if they...</i>

70
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,913
<i>If they know.</i>

71
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:30,817
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

72
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,086
That would be the day.

73
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:36,139
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the gettin' place.

74
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:40,794
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

75
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,865
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

76
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,469
What'd you get for that thing?

77
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,689
You don't need to know
everything, Carla Jean.

78
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,159
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours,

79
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,929
I'm gonna take you
in the back and screw you.

80
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,199
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

81
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,352
Fine. I don't want to know.

82
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:09,389
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,391
That'll work.

84
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,056
All right.

85
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,198
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

86
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:40,770
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

87
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,772
Going where?

88
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,742
A little something I forgot
to do, but I'll be back.

89
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:49,229
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something

90
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,131
dumber than hell,
but I'm going anyways.

91
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,403
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

92
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,605
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

93
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,945
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

94
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:02,275
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

95
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,876
And the gas?

96
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:07,397
Y'all getting any rain
up your way?

97
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:12,034
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

98
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:17,006
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

99
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,876
...friendo?

100
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:25,131
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

101
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:28,601
I was just passing the time.

102
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:32,972
If you don't want to accept that, I
don't know what else I can do for you.

103
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,328
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

104
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,587
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

105
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:49,556
With anything.

106
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:54,059
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

107
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,914
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

108
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:04,370
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

109
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:06,338
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

110
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,558
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

111
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:13,212
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. At dark.

112
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,035
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

113
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,887
Sir?

114
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:25,258
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

115
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,562
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

116
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:33,883
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I
said, what time do you go to bed?

117
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,803
Oh.

118
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:41,757
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

119
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,143
I could come back then.

120
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:45,761
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

121
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:48,498
Yeah, you said that.

122
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:54,020
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

123
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:57,856
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

124
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:03,012
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

125
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:06,782
You married into it?

126
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:11,738
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

127
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,724
Raised a family there.
In Temple.

128
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:18,878
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

129
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,264
If that's the way
you want to put it.

130
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,283
Well, I don't have
some way to put it.

131
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:26,269
That's the way it is.

132
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:36,846
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

133
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:41,967
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

134
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:45,955
Oh, I don't know.
I couldn't say.

135
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,059
- Call it.
- Call it?

136
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,328
- Yes.
- For what?

137
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,163
Just call it.

138
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:59,952
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

139
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:03,206
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

140
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:06,626
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

141
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:10,313
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

142
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,431
You just didn't know it.

143
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,551
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

144
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:20,039
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

145
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,961
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

146
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:26,462
You have to say. Call it.

147
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:29,815
Well, look, I need to know
what I stand to win.

148
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,868
- Everything.
- How's that?

149
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:35,772
You stand to win everything.
Call it.

150
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:43,412
All right. Heads, then.

151
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:49,285
Well done.

152
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,088
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

153
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,726
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

154
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:58,411
Where do you want me to put it?

155
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,329
Anywhere not in your pocket.

156
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,218
Or it'll get mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.

157
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:09,822
Which it is.

158
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,084
Llewelyn?

159
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:27,723
What the hell?

160
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,643
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

161
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:34,380
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

162
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,581
Well, how come?

163
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:37,683
Look, right now
it's midnight Sunday.

164
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:39,735
Courthouse opens nine
hours from now.

165
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:44,090
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

166
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:46,426
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

167
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,994
- How long do we...?
- What point would you quit

168
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:52,498
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

169
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,534
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

170
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:57,370
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

171
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,622
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

172
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:02,925
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

173
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:07,997
Well, don't fall down
apologizing.

174
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:10,533
Oh, baby, things happen.

175
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,486
Come on, I can't take them back.

176
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,843
Mind riding bitch?

177
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,042
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,914
Got a screwgie?

179
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:07,156
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

180
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,660
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

181
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,999
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

182
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,670
These are some ripe petunias.

183
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,855
Hold this, please.

184
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,415
Want it?

185
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:37,970
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

186
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:40,005
All right.

187
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,443
Give me that.

188
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:56,622
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

189
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:59,926
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

190
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,293
Step in there.

191
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:04,196
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

192
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:07,533
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

193
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,353
- Be careful.
- Always am.

194
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,221
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

195
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:14,540
Don't hurt no one.

196
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:18,727
If you say so.

197
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:57,266
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,801
We should've brought wienies.

199
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,837
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

200
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:05,140
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

201
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:10,212
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

202
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:14,500
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his
car, killed that man on the highway,

203
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:20,072
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

204
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:23,475
That's very linear, sheriff.

205
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:26,545
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:29,115
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

207
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:33,152
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

208
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:37,523
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

209
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,726
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

210
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:45,797
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

211
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,434
You can see the sipes
real clear.

212
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:54,240
Somebody's pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

213
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:57,910
I know this truck.

214
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,312
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

215
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:03,082
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

216
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:07,286
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

217
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:11,223
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

218
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:16,229
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

219
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,216
This is just a deal
gone wrong, isn't it?

220
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:25,821
Yup. Appears to have
been a glitch or two.

221
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,162
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

222
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:36,198
Couple of .45 ACPs.

223
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:40,402
Somebody unloaded on
that thing with a shotgun.

224
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,074
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

225
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,409
I don't know.

226
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,767
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

227
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:58,003
These boys appear
to be managerial.

228
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:01,874
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

229
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,809
Wild West over there.

230
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:09,681
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

231
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:12,701
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

232
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:15,421
Then, whoa, differences, and...

233
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:19,541
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

234
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:23,079
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

235
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,614
Probably I don't.

236
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:30,352
Well, it's a mess,
ain't it, sheriff?

237
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:35,124
If it ain't, it'll do
till the mess gets here.

238
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:30,806
Yes, sir?

239
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:34,844
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

240
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:37,780
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

241
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:41,183
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

242
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,285
I can't say.

243
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,255
Where does he work?

244
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:47,389
Sir, I ain't at liberty

245
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,760
to give out no information
about our residents.

246
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:53,762
Where does he work?

247
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:55,731
Did you not hear me?

248
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:59,668
We can't give out
no information.

249
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:25,261
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

250
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:29,231
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

251
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:32,067
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

252
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:34,403
Yes, I do.

253
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:37,737
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- Well, I got a good one.

254
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:39,132
So that oughta even out.

255
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,578
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

256
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,747
- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:46,682
She's just gonna
cuss you up and down.

258
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:50,552
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

259
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,856
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

260
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:55,640
You are retired.

261
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,876
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

262
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:04,617
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

263
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,640
Sheriff's department!

264
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,661
Look at that lock.

265
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:20,799
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

266
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,389
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

267
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:32,494
Sheriff's department!

268
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,540
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

269
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:05,477
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

270
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:09,013
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

271
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:11,550
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

272
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:17,289
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

273
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:22,127
We gotta circulate
this on radio.

274
00:36:22,228 --> 00:36:23,828
All right.

275
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:26,715
What do we circulate?

276
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:32,621
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

277
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:41,547
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

278
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:45,500
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches

279
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,853
- that are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

280
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:57,062
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

281
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:05,404
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

282
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,390
Someplace cheap.

283
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:12,311
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

284
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:16,114
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

285
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:21,019
I'm just one person, so it don't
matter the size of the bed.

286
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:29,678
<i>This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.</i>

287
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:31,797
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

288
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:34,336
<i>- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?</i>

289
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:37,872
<i>Llewelyn? No, he ain't.</i>

290
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:39,641
You expect him?

291
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:43,912
<i>Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?</i>

292
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:54,757
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

293
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,091
Shoulder, size 11?

294
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:58,660
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

295
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:02,798
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

296
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:31,393
Don't stop. Just ride me
up past those rooms.

297
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:35,830
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

298
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,400
I wanna see if someone's here.

299
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,709
Keep going. Don't stop.

300
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,712
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

301
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:52,714
It's all right.

302
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:56,384
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

303
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:59,737
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

304
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,024
You're in the jackpot, and I'm
trying to get you out of it.

305
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,427
Take me to another motel.

306
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:56,661
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

307
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,197
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

308
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:04,002
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

309
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:09,224
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

310
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,558
No, sir.

311
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:14,696
You said entry wound in the
forehead, no exit wound.

312
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:15,261
Yes, sir.

313
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:17,140
You telling me he shot
this boy in the head?

314
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:20,368
and then went digging around
in there with a pocket knife?

315
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,789
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

316
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,141
Can I freshen that there
for you, sheriff?

317
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,077
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

318
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:32,130
Ranger and the DEA are headed
back out to the scene.

319
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:34,550
Gonna join 'em?

320
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,369
Any new bodies
accumulate out there?

321
00:42:38,554 --> 00:42:41,873
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

322
00:42:56,171 --> 00:43:00,342
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

323
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:04,312
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

324
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:06,214
- Tent poles?
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:07,899
You already have the tent?

326
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,601
Well, something like that.

327
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:12,403
Give me the model number on
the tent, I can order poles.

328
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,940
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

329
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:17,275
The kind with most poles.

330
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:42,133
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

331
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:44,803
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

332
00:43:44,903 --> 00:43:47,439
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

333
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,874
And do you have
a map of the rooms?

334
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:52,811
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

335
00:43:54,547 --> 00:43:56,748
Oh, thank you.

336
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:01,886
How about 38?

337
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:06,525
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

338
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:10,979
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

339
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:47,608
How'd you find that?

340
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,718
You shouldn't be doin' that.

341
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,322
Even a young man like you.

342
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:45,443
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

343
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:53,317
Dangerous.

344
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:14,171
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

345
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:17,725
Yes, sir, I know him
every which way.

346
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,228
When did you last see him?

347
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,796
Uh...

348
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:24,799
...November 28th, last year.

349
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,137
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

350
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:33,291
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

351
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:39,013
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

352
00:53:41,016 --> 00:53:42,516
Got a loose cannon here.

353
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:45,969
We're out a bunch of money, and the
other party is out his product.

354
00:53:46,388 --> 00:53:48,890
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up

355
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:53,394
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

356
00:53:53,495 --> 00:53:57,731
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

357
00:53:57,832 --> 00:53:59,566
OK.

358
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:03,655
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

359
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:07,441
I just wanna know your
opinion of him, in general.

360
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:13,231
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

361
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:15,283
He's bad enough you called me.

362
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:20,071
Yeah, he's a psychopathic
killer, but so what?

363
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:21,739
There's plenty of them around.

364
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,491
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

365
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:28,596
and two others in that colossal
goat-fuck out in the desert.

366
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:31,582
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

367
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,988
You've led something of a charmed
life, haven't you, Mr. Wells?

368
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:43,561
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

369
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:47,231
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

370
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:50,968
Could you validate
my parking ticket?

371
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:57,358
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

372
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:07,268
You know, I counted the floors to
this building from the street.

373
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:10,254
- And?
- There's one missing.

374
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,808
We'll look into it.

375
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,231
One room. One night.

376
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:41,269
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

377
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,490
You on all night?

378
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:51,312
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

379
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:55,816
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

380
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:58,836
There's someone who been
looking for me. Not police.

381
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:01,606
You just call me if anyone else
checks in tonight.

382
00:56:01,707 --> 00:56:04,274
And by anyone,
I mean any swinging dick.

383
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:49,003
There just ain't no way.

384
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,759
Don't worry,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

385
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,861
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

386
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:40,234
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

387
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:06,209
Were you in a car accident?

388
01:06:07,979 --> 01:06:10,497
I'll give you 500 bucks
for that coat.

389
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:13,333
Lemme see the money.

390
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,021
Were you in a car accident?

391
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,042
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

392
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:26,680
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

393
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:34,888
Give it here.

394
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,897
Gimme that beer too.

395
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,434
How much?

396
01:06:48,886 --> 01:06:50,954
Brian, give him the beer.

397
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:06,029
Ah!

398
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,571
<i>Médico...</i>

399
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:07,841
<i>...por favor.</i>

400
01:11:10,915 --> 01:11:12,716
Just went up!

401
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:18,205
<i>...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,</i>

402
01:11:18,305 --> 01:11:20,406
<i>and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!</i>

403
01:11:20,507 --> 01:11:24,077
<i>Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,</i>

404
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,064
<i>though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight</i>

405
01:11:28,165 --> 01:11:31,568
<i>instead of lost it. The most
difficult part is still ahead.</i>

406
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:33,937
<i>Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.</i>

407
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:36,439
<i>It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.</i>

408
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:40,410
<i>But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...</i>

409
01:12:37,334 --> 01:12:41,921
<i>Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.</i>

410
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:12,969
Any word on those vehicles yet?

411
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,806
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

412
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:20,526
Those vehicles are titled and
registered to deceased people.

413
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:23,429
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

414
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:25,549
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

415
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,602
No. Lord, no.

416
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,154
There's this month's checks.

417
01:13:31,255 --> 01:13:33,940
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

418
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,993
Gonna try to keep from it
much as I can.

419
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:39,896
He's going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

420
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,597
That's cordial of him.

421
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,767
Can I get you to call Loretta,

422
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:47,320
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

423
01:13:47,421 --> 01:13:50,623
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

424
01:13:50,724 --> 01:13:53,326
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

425
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:56,499
Do you want me to wait till
you quit the building?

426
01:13:56,525 --> 01:13:57,246
Uh-huh.

427
01:13:57,248 --> 01:14:00,650
Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

428
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,023
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

429
01:14:07,124 --> 01:14:11,127
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily
anew. Something like that.

430
01:14:11,228 --> 01:14:14,080
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

431
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:17,150
Might come to three before it's over.

432
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:20,036
What the hell?

433
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:30,513
Sheriff?

434
01:14:30,614 --> 01:14:32,782
You looked at your load lately?

435
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:35,835
- Oh.
- That is a damn outrage.

436
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:38,671
One of those
tie-downs worked loose.

437
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:40,940
How many bodies
did you leave with?

438
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,976
I ain't lost
none of 'em, sheriff.

439
01:14:44,077 --> 01:14:46,546
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

440
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:48,981
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

441
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:51,784
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

442
01:14:51,885 --> 01:14:53,919
You get your ass outta here.

443
01:14:56,774 --> 01:14:59,825
<i>Buenos días.</i>

444
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:03,847
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

445
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:07,049
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

446
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:10,053
Don't worry. I'm not
the man who's after you.

447
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:13,173
I know that.

448
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:15,475
I've seen him.

449
01:15:15,576 --> 01:15:19,128
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

450
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,164
Huh.

451
01:15:21,265 --> 01:15:23,817
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

452
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:26,186
Don't think that's how
I'd describe him.

453
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:27,937
How would you describe him?

454
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:32,258
I guess I'd say he doesn't
have a sense of humor.

455
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,878
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

456
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:37,580
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

457
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:40,800
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

458
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:44,037
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

459
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:46,889
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

460
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,692
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

461
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:54,847
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

462
01:15:56,717 --> 01:15:59,986
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

463
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:03,089
- What did you do?
- Welder.

464
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,241
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

465
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:07,910
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

466
01:16:08,012 --> 01:16:09,779
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

467
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,982
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

468
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:13,833
What did I say?

469
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:19,923
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

470
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:21,374
Hmm.

471
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:23,509
So was I.

472
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:27,397
So, what does that make me,
your buddy?

473
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:32,669
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

474
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:37,373
It's too late.
I spent it.

475
01:16:37,474 --> 01:16:39,876
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey,

476
01:16:39,977 --> 01:16:42,945
and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

477
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:47,234
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

478
01:16:51,138 --> 01:16:55,391
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

479
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:06,869
Maybe he's the one that needs
to be worried... about me.

480
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,387
He isn't.

481
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:12,224
Yeah. You're not
cut out for this.

482
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:16,062
You're just a guy who happened
to find those vehicles.

483
01:17:21,618 --> 01:17:24,186
I'm across the river
at the Hotel Eagle.

484
01:17:24,905 --> 01:17:27,489
Carson Wells.

485
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:29,726
Call me when you've had enough.

486
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:32,595
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

487
01:17:32,696 --> 01:17:35,982
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

488
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:40,420
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

489
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:45,575
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

490
01:17:45,676 --> 01:17:47,460
He's a peculiar man.

491
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:52,798
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

492
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,453
or anything like that.
Not like you.

493
01:17:57,621 --> 01:17:59,872
Yeah. He's not even like me.

494
01:17:59,973 --> 01:18:03,743
No, he don't talk as much as
you. I give him points for that.

495
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:08,598
Carla Jean,
thank you for coming.

496
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,399
Don't know why I did.

497
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,336
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

498
01:18:13,437 --> 01:18:15,805
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

499
01:18:15,906 --> 01:18:17,807
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

500
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:22,195
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

501
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,297
He don't need
any trouble from you.

502
01:18:24,398 --> 01:18:26,833
It ain't me he's
in trouble with.

503
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:30,336
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

504
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:34,340
These people will kill him,
Carla Jean. They won't quit.

505
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:37,192
He won't neither. He never has.

506
01:18:37,428 --> 01:18:42,715
He can take all comers.

507
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:47,103
You know Charlie Walser's got
that place out east of Sanderson?

508
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:50,857
You know how he used to
slaughter beeves,

509
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,625
hit 'em right there with a maul,

510
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:54,728
truss 'em and slit their
throats?

511
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:57,713
Charlie's got one all trussed
up, all set to drain him

512
01:18:57,814 --> 01:19:00,917
and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

513
01:19:01,018 --> 01:19:03,636
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

514
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:06,272
You'll excuse the... Well...

515
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:08,975
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

516
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:12,144
but with the swinging and
thrashing, it's a glance shot.

517
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:14,614
Ricochets, hits Charlie
in the shoulder.

518
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:18,451
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

519
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:22,805
The point being, that even in the
contest between man and steer,

520
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:25,108
the issue is not certain.

521
01:19:32,366 --> 01:19:37,320
When Llewelyn calls, just
tell him I can make him safe.

522
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:45,461
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

523
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:49,833
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little
rod about that far under the brain.

524
01:19:49,934 --> 01:19:53,319
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

525
01:19:55,823 --> 01:19:59,959
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

526
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:05,381
My mind wanders.

527
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:30,750
Hello, Carson.

528
01:21:32,903 --> 01:21:34,670
Let's go to your room.

529
01:21:46,733 --> 01:21:49,318
You don't have to do this.

530
01:21:49,419 --> 01:21:53,673
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

531
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:58,278
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

532
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:02,548
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

533
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:05,168
And everybody just walks away.

534
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:08,604
An ATM.

535
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:15,444
I know where the satchel is.

536
01:22:15,545 --> 01:22:17,713
If you knew, you would
have it with you.

537
01:22:17,814 --> 01:22:22,017
I can find it from the river
bank. I know where it is.

538
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:26,139
- I know something better.
- What's that?

539
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,040
I know where it's going to be.

540
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:33,028
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me

541
01:22:33,129 --> 01:22:35,932
and placed at my feet.

542
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:40,169
You don't know to a certainty.

543
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:44,240
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

544
01:22:44,341 --> 01:22:48,061
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

545
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,962
You should admit your situation.

546
01:22:50,063 --> 01:22:53,115
There would be
more dignity in it.

547
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:01,457
You go to hell.

548
01:23:01,591 --> 01:23:05,127
All right.
Let me ask you something.

549
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:11,501
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,

550
01:23:11,602 --> 01:23:14,437
of what use was the rule?

551
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:24,797
Do you have any idea
how crazy you are?

552
01:23:24,898 --> 01:23:27,182
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

553
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:29,668
I mean the nature of you.

554
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:39,795
You... You can
have the money, Anton.

555
01:24:19,553 --> 01:24:22,254
<i>- Hello?
- Yes?</i>

556
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:27,159
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

557
01:24:29,346 --> 01:24:31,897
Not in the sense that you mean.

558
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:37,837
<i>- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?</i>

559
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:40,856
You know who it is.

560
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:44,226
<i>- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.</i>

561
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:46,562
I think you do.

562
01:24:46,663 --> 01:24:48,297
Do you know where I'm going?

563
01:24:48,364 --> 01:24:51,133
Why would I care
where you're going?

564
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,703
I know where you are.

565
01:24:53,804 --> 01:24:56,038
<i>Yeah, where am I?</i>

566
01:24:56,139 --> 01:25:01,243
You're in the hospital across the
river, but that's not where I'm going.

567
01:25:01,344 --> 01:25:03,679
Do you know where I'm going?

568
01:25:04,981 --> 01:25:09,251
<i>- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.</i>

569
01:25:09,352 --> 01:25:10,853
<i>You know she won't be there.</i>

570
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,372
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

571
01:25:13,473 --> 01:25:15,891
So, what're you going
up there for?

572
01:25:19,163 --> 01:25:22,064
You know how this is gonna
turn out, don't you?

573
01:25:23,867 --> 01:25:25,234
Nope.

574
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:30,689
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

575
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:33,125
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

576
01:25:33,226 --> 01:25:38,196
<i>Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.</i>

577
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:42,485
That's the best deal
you're gonna get.

578
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:46,722
I won't tell you you can save
yourself, because you can't.

579
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:52,744
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you
something, all right.

580
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:55,314
Decided to make you
a special project of mine.

581
01:25:55,415 --> 01:25:58,384
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

582
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:05,057
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

583
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:06,859
None of the three
had ID on 'em,

584
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,746
but they're tellin' me that all
three is Mexicans... was Mexicans.

585
01:26:10,847 --> 01:26:15,918
There's a question, whether
they stopped being and when.

586
01:26:17,754 --> 01:26:19,622
Yes, sir.

587
01:26:19,723 --> 01:26:22,291
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

588
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,778
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

589
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,747
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for,

590
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:31,284
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

591
01:26:31,385 --> 01:26:35,087
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they was in.

592
01:26:35,188 --> 01:26:38,307
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

593
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:42,227
I can't think of any other word
for it. Who are these people?

594
01:26:42,328 --> 01:26:45,731
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

595
01:26:45,832 --> 01:26:49,719
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

596
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:52,839
cash their
Social Security checks.

597
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:57,459
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

598
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,628
Maybe their television set
was broke.

599
01:26:59,763 --> 01:27:03,266
And this went on until,
here, I quote,

600
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:07,119
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

601
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:09,372
wearing only a dog collar."

602
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:13,542
You can't make up such a thing
as that. I dare you to try.

603
01:27:13,643 --> 01:27:17,612
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

604
01:27:17,713 --> 01:27:20,432
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

605
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:31,077
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

606
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:35,214
Ain't a whole lot else
you can do.

607
01:27:37,884 --> 01:27:39,418
Tell me something.

608
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:42,988
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

609
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:46,993
I don't know. American citizens?

610
01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:49,879
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

611
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,830
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

612
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:54,383
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

613
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:58,403
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

614
01:27:58,504 --> 01:27:59,905
If I don't, they don't.

615
01:28:00,006 --> 01:28:01,991
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

616
01:28:02,058 --> 01:28:05,010
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

617
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:08,864
Well, I got an overcoat on.

618
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,866
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

619
01:28:10,967 --> 01:28:13,485
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

620
01:28:13,586 --> 01:28:15,904
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

621
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:18,290
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

622
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:20,742
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,

623
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:24,897
August 7th, 1966,
July 2nd, 1968.

624
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:30,486
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

625
01:28:30,587 --> 01:28:34,173
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

626
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:46,218
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

627
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,554
- I need everything else.
- OK.

628
01:28:49,655 --> 01:28:52,691
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

629
01:28:52,792 --> 01:28:55,361
No, sir. It's unusual.

630
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:11,510
<i>- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.</i>

631
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:14,079
<i>- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,</i>

632
01:29:14,181 --> 01:29:16,382
and don't you
hang up this phone.

633
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:20,018
<i>Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.</i>

634
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:22,688
<i>- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.</i>

635
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:26,108
<i>- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?</i>

636
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:29,811
I don't know. I had the sheriff
here from Terrell County. He...

637
01:29:30,146 --> 01:29:33,598
<i>- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?</i>

638
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,169
<i>- You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

639
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:39,337
What makes you say that?

640
01:29:39,438 --> 01:29:42,875
<i>- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!</i>

641
01:29:42,976 --> 01:29:46,712
Look, I want you to meet me at the
Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

642
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:49,314
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

643
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,833
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

644
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:54,904
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,

645
01:29:55,005 --> 01:29:57,973
he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

646
01:29:58,074 --> 01:30:00,509
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

647
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:04,146
<i>Find who? What am I
supposed to do with mother?</i>

648
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:06,081
<i>- She'll be all right.
- All right?</i>

649
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:08,818
<i>Be all right?
I got the cancer!</i>

650
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:11,053
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

651
01:30:42,586 --> 01:30:45,371
Hmm.

652
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:47,122
Who are you?

653
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,145
- Me?
- Yes.

654
01:30:53,246 --> 01:30:55,363
Nobody.

655
01:30:55,464 --> 01:30:57,349
Accounting.

656
01:30:58,568 --> 01:31:01,253
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

657
01:31:03,456 --> 01:31:05,157
He feels...

658
01:31:05,258 --> 01:31:09,144
He felt that
the more people looking...

659
01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:14,116
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

660
01:31:14,217 --> 01:31:16,318
I see.

661
01:31:18,405 --> 01:31:20,272
Are you going to shoot me?

662
01:31:26,362 --> 01:31:28,330
That depends.

663
01:31:30,533 --> 01:31:32,301
Do you see me?

664
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:37,706
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

665
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:39,924
Three years ago,
I pre-visioned it.

666
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:42,211
It ain't three years
we been married.

667
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:46,448
Three years ago I said them
very words, "no" and "good."

668
01:31:46,549 --> 01:31:50,152
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

669
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:56,458
I got the cancer and look at
this, not even a home to go to.

670
01:31:56,559 --> 01:31:58,977
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

671
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:02,214
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

672
01:32:02,315 --> 01:32:05,751
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

673
01:32:14,444 --> 01:32:17,546
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

674
01:32:17,647 --> 01:32:21,416
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

675
01:32:21,517 --> 01:32:25,120
You just set there. I'll get
tickets and a cart for the bags.

676
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:27,355
You need help
with the bags, madam?

677
01:32:27,457 --> 01:32:31,594
Well, thank God, there is one
gentleman left in west Texas.

678
01:32:31,695 --> 01:32:34,129
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

679
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:38,900
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

680
01:32:39,085 --> 01:32:42,271
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

681
01:32:42,372 --> 01:32:44,790
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

682
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:45,991
Oh...

683
01:32:46,092 --> 01:32:47,893
<i>Carla Jean,
how are you?</i>

684
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:52,030
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

685
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:54,650
<i>Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...</i>

686
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,718
Um...

687
01:32:56,819 --> 01:32:59,154
True story. I couldn't
swear to every detail,

688
01:32:59,255 --> 01:33:03,141
<i>- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.</i>

689
01:33:03,242 --> 01:33:06,862
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

690
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:08,797
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

691
01:33:08,898 --> 01:33:13,502
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

692
01:33:13,603 --> 01:33:16,655
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

693
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:20,876
<i>- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

694
01:33:21,077 --> 01:33:23,746
He never thinks he needs any.

695
01:33:23,847 --> 01:33:27,566
<i>Carla Jean, I will not
harm your man.</i>

696
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:31,470
<i>And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.</i>

697
01:33:40,046 --> 01:33:42,314
What's the problem there,
neighbor?

698
01:33:42,415 --> 01:33:47,052
Yep, that'll suck some power,
over time.

699
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:52,257
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

700
01:33:52,358 --> 01:33:56,328
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

701
01:33:56,429 --> 01:34:00,749
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

702
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:04,553
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

703
01:34:04,654 --> 01:34:07,522
Just lightin' out for
the territories, huh?

704
01:34:07,548 --> 01:34:09,633
Brother, I been there.

705
01:34:09,709 --> 01:34:12,911
Well, there's airstrips.

706
01:34:13,012 --> 01:34:15,581
The airport is El Paso.

707
01:34:15,682 --> 01:34:17,115
If you want someplace specific,

708
01:34:17,216 --> 01:34:21,153
you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

709
01:34:21,254 --> 01:34:23,722
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

710
01:34:23,823 --> 01:34:26,474
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

711
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:29,578
What are you talking about?

712
01:34:45,361 --> 01:34:49,297
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

713
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:53,368
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

714
01:34:53,469 --> 01:34:55,837
Yeah, that's me.

715
01:34:55,938 --> 01:34:58,640
I got beers in my room.

716
01:34:58,974 --> 01:35:02,644
- Oh, uh, I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

717
01:35:02,745 --> 01:35:05,331
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

718
01:35:05,432 --> 01:35:07,899
- Well, half.
- What else then?

719
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,188
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

720
01:35:13,289 --> 01:35:15,957
But no one ever sees that.

721
01:35:16,058 --> 01:35:19,277
Beer! That's what's comin'.

722
01:35:19,378 --> 01:35:22,014
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

723
01:35:22,248 --> 01:35:24,883
No, ma'am, I know
what beer leads to.

724
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:28,887
Beer leads to more beer.

725
01:36:15,785 --> 01:36:17,286
You all right?

726
01:36:22,242 --> 01:36:24,376
Call the police.

727
01:36:30,065 --> 01:36:32,534
Your local law enforcement.

728
01:36:33,635 --> 01:36:35,454
I'm not on their radio.

729
01:36:35,555 --> 01:36:38,674
I met his
daughter at the...

730
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:29,124
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

731
01:37:29,325 --> 01:37:32,794
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

732
01:37:32,895 --> 01:37:35,113
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

733
01:37:35,315 --> 01:37:37,666
I suppose so.

734
01:37:37,883 --> 01:37:40,118
Though they was
leavin' in a hurry.

735
01:37:40,136 --> 01:37:45,490
It's all the goddamn money,
Ed Tom. Money and the drugs.

736
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:49,894
It's just goddamn
beyond everything.

737
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:53,181
What's it mean?
What's it leading to?

738
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:56,184
You know, if you'd have
told me 20 years ago

739
01:37:56,285 --> 01:37:59,387
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

740
01:37:59,488 --> 01:38:02,657
with green hair,
bones in their noses,

741
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:05,210
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

742
01:38:05,311 --> 01:38:06,745
Signs and wonders.

743
01:38:06,846 --> 01:38:09,715
But I think once you quit
hearing "sir" and "ma'am,"

744
01:38:09,816 --> 01:38:11,416
the rest is soon to foller.

745
01:38:11,517 --> 01:38:13,434
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

746
01:38:13,535 --> 01:38:17,339
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

747
01:38:17,373 --> 01:38:19,024
Not the one thing.

748
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:21,876
Yeah, well, none of that
explains your man, though.

749
01:38:21,977 --> 01:38:25,079
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

750
01:38:25,181 --> 01:38:28,316
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

751
01:38:28,417 --> 01:38:31,986
Well, sometimes I think
he's pretty much a ghost.

752
01:38:32,087 --> 01:38:33,939
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

753
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:37,575
Yeah. All of that over at the Eagle Hotel?
Just beyond everything.

754
01:38:37,676 --> 01:38:40,429
Yeah. Got some
hard bark on him.

755
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:43,598
Why... Well, that don't
hardly say it.

756
01:38:44,667 --> 01:38:46,468
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

757
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:51,089
walks right back in the next and
shoots a retired Army colonel.

758
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,641
It's hard to believe.

759
01:38:52,742 --> 01:38:55,894
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

760
01:38:55,995 --> 01:39:01,366
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

761
01:39:01,467 --> 01:39:04,402
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

762
01:39:04,503 --> 01:39:07,088
Sorry we couldn't
help your boy.

763
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:42,370
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

764
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:45,323
Who else'd be driving up
in your truck?

765
01:42:45,424 --> 01:42:46,841
- You heard it?
- How's that?

766
01:42:46,942 --> 01:42:51,445
Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.

767
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:55,750
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

768
01:42:55,851 --> 01:42:57,169
How'd you know
it was my truck?

769
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:00,621
I deduced it
when you walked in.

770
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:02,890
How many of them
things you got now?

771
01:43:02,991 --> 01:43:05,377
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

772
01:43:05,478 --> 01:43:08,863
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."

773
01:43:08,964 --> 01:43:13,334
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

774
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:20,258
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

775
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:24,613
I got to say,
you're looking older.

776
01:43:24,714 --> 01:43:26,448
I am older.

777
01:43:27,282 --> 01:43:29,784
Got a letter from your wife.

778
01:43:29,885 --> 01:43:34,256
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

779
01:43:34,357 --> 01:43:38,043
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

780
01:43:40,979 --> 01:43:44,265
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

781
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:53,358
How fresh is that coffee?

782
01:43:53,459 --> 01:43:59,481
I generally make a fresh pot every
week, even if there's some left over.

783
01:44:01,216 --> 01:44:03,835
That man that shot you
died in prison?

784
01:44:05,871 --> 01:44:08,022
Angola. Yeah.

785
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:10,892
What'd you done
he'd a been released?

786
01:44:10,993 --> 01:44:13,845
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

787
01:44:13,979 --> 01:44:15,546
Wouldn't be no point in it.

788
01:44:15,647 --> 01:44:18,850
Kindly surprised
to hear you say that.

789
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:22,637
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

790
01:44:22,738 --> 01:44:26,424
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

791
01:44:26,525 --> 01:44:30,328
After a while, you have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.

792
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:34,999
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

793
01:44:37,553 --> 01:44:41,756
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

794
01:44:41,857 --> 01:44:44,242
I don't know.

795
01:44:46,662 --> 01:44:48,763
I feel overmatched.

796
01:44:52,801 --> 01:44:55,302
I always figured
when I got older,

797
01:44:55,404 --> 01:45:00,675
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

798
01:45:03,445 --> 01:45:04,696
And He didn't.

799
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:10,184
And I don't blame Him.

800
01:45:12,454 --> 01:45:16,074
If I was Him, I'd have the same
opinion of me that He does.

801
01:45:16,175 --> 01:45:17,992
You don't know what He thinks.

802
01:45:31,974 --> 01:45:35,743
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster
and badge over to the Rangers,

803
01:45:35,844 --> 01:45:38,246
put it in their museum.

804
01:45:38,347 --> 01:45:43,150
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

805
01:45:43,252 --> 01:45:46,987
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

806
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:53,895
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

807
01:45:53,996 --> 01:45:56,898
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

808
01:45:56,999 --> 01:46:00,668
Well, they was ahead of him.

809
01:46:00,769 --> 01:46:03,337
Shot him in his doorway.

810
01:46:03,389 --> 01:46:06,057
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

811
01:46:06,308 --> 01:46:09,911
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

812
01:46:10,062 --> 01:46:15,299
They just sat there on their
horses, watching him die.

813
01:46:15,317 --> 01:46:20,071
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

814
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,791
Left out.

815
01:46:24,593 --> 01:46:28,213
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

816
01:46:28,314 --> 01:46:31,332
Shot through the left lung.

817
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:36,270
And that was that...
as they say.

818
01:46:39,374 --> 01:46:41,092
When'd he die?

819
01:46:42,027 --> 01:46:45,379
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

820
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:49,150
No, I mean, was it right away
or in the night or...

821
01:46:49,267 --> 01:46:52,904
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

822
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:58,242
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

823
01:47:01,062 --> 01:47:03,948
What you got ain't nothin' new.

824
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,852
This country is hard on people.

825
01:47:11,373 --> 01:47:13,657
You can't stop what's coming.

826
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,661
It ain't all waitin' on you.

827
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:22,233
That's vanity.

828
01:48:22,995 --> 01:48:25,546
I knew this wasn't done with.

829
01:48:28,233 --> 01:48:30,267
I ain't got the money.

830
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:36,541
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

831
01:48:38,193 --> 01:48:43,030
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

832
01:48:43,799 --> 01:48:45,900
I wouldn't worry about it.

833
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,120
I need to sit down.

834
01:49:05,204 --> 01:49:07,388
You got no cause to hurt me.

835
01:49:07,489 --> 01:49:11,376
No. But I gave my word.

836
01:49:12,594 --> 01:49:16,464
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

837
01:49:19,301 --> 01:49:21,819
That don't make sense.

838
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,189
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

839
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:28,893
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

840
01:49:28,994 --> 01:49:32,029
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

841
01:49:36,885 --> 01:49:39,037
Not like that.

842
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:42,507
Not like you say.

843
01:49:48,297 --> 01:49:49,914
You don't have to do this.

844
01:49:50,015 --> 01:49:52,667
People always say
the same thing.

845
01:49:54,169 --> 01:49:56,186
What do they say?

846
01:49:56,288 --> 01:49:59,907
They say,
"You don't have to do this."

847
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:05,479
- You don't.
- OK.

848
01:50:10,019 --> 01:50:12,586
This is the best I can do.

849
01:50:13,188 --> 01:50:14,372
Call it.

850
01:50:18,727 --> 01:50:22,563
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

851
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:27,184
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

852
01:50:27,285 --> 01:50:31,789
- Call it.
- No.

853
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:34,659
I ain't gonna call it.

854
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:39,147
Call it.

855
01:50:39,247 --> 01:50:42,299
The coin don't have no say.

856
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,435
It's just you.

857
01:50:46,621 --> 01:50:50,090
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

858
01:52:32,244 --> 01:52:35,596
Mister, you got a bone
sticking out of your arm.

859
01:52:35,697 --> 01:52:38,116
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

860
01:52:38,217 --> 01:52:41,068
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

861
01:52:41,169 --> 01:52:43,570
All right.

862
01:52:43,672 --> 01:52:47,724
Are you all right? You got
a bone sticking out your arm.

863
01:52:48,743 --> 01:52:50,661
What'll you take for the shirt?

864
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,502
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

865
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,679
Look at that fucking bone.

866
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:10,081
Tie this for me.

867
01:53:10,866 --> 01:53:13,684
Just tie it, just tie it.

868
01:53:31,003 --> 01:53:34,688
Hell, mister. Look, I don't mind
helping someone out.

869
01:53:34,789 --> 01:53:37,391
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

870
01:53:37,492 --> 01:53:40,828
Take it and...
you didn't see me.

871
01:53:40,929 --> 01:53:43,063
I was already gone.

872
01:53:43,164 --> 01:53:44,698
Yes, sir.

873
01:53:49,087 --> 01:53:52,289
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

874
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:57,094
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

875
01:54:17,048 --> 01:54:19,583
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

876
01:54:19,684 --> 01:54:23,920
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

877
01:54:24,022 --> 01:54:25,956
I mean, would you
care to join me?

878
01:54:26,191 --> 01:54:28,592
Lord, no, I'm not retired.

879
01:54:30,462 --> 01:54:35,032
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.

880
01:54:38,887 --> 01:54:42,423
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

881
01:54:42,674 --> 01:54:46,927
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

882
01:54:47,028 --> 01:54:49,930
They always is
to the party concerned.

883
01:54:52,117 --> 01:54:54,968
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

884
01:54:56,905 --> 01:55:02,125
All right, then. Two of 'em, both had
my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

885
01:55:02,227 --> 01:55:05,195
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

886
01:55:05,296 --> 01:55:08,999
So, in a sense,
he's the younger man.

887
01:55:09,234 --> 01:55:12,320
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

888
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:14,888
but it was about
meeting him in town,

889
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:17,875
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

890
01:55:17,976 --> 01:55:19,710
I think I lost it.

891
01:55:21,312 --> 01:55:26,033
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

892
01:55:26,168 --> 01:55:30,421
And I was a-horseback, going
through the mountains of a night.

893
01:55:30,522 --> 01:55:33,724
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

894
01:55:33,825 --> 01:55:37,295
It was cold, and there was
snow on the ground.

895
01:55:37,396 --> 01:55:39,813
And he rode past me
and kept on going,

896
01:55:39,914 --> 01:55:42,966
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

897
01:55:44,452 --> 01:55:48,406
He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.

898
01:55:50,091 --> 01:55:53,894
When he rode past, I seen he was
carrying fire in a horn,

899
01:55:53,995 --> 01:55:55,846
the way people
used to do, and I...

900
01:55:55,947 --> 01:55:58,666
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

901
01:55:58,767 --> 01:56:00,668
'bout the color of the moon.

902
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:04,588
And, in the dream,
I knew that he was...

903
01:56:05,156 --> 01:56:07,458
...going on ahead.

904
01:56:07,559 --> 01:56:12,663
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

905
01:56:15,967 --> 01:56:19,253
And I knew that whenever
I got there, he'd be there.

906
01:56:23,591 --> 01:56:25,876
And then I woke up.
