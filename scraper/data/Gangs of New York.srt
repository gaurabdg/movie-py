2
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,532
No son, never.

3
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,369
The blood stays
on the blade.

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,010
One day you'll understand.

5
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,851
Some of it I have remembered.

6
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:20,321
And the rest I
took from dreams.

7
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,621
St. Michael the Archangel
defend us in battle.

8
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,911
Be our protector.

9
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:35,501
Against the snares. And
the wickedness of the devil.

10
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,671
Now son, who's that?

11
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,091
St. Michael.

12
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:40,631
Who is it?

13
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,761
St. Michael.

14
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:42,921
And what did he do?

15
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:44,932
He cast Satan out
of Paradse.

16
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:46,972
Good boy!

17
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,165
Johnny!

18
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,205
What's the battle?

19
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,255
Natives against the
Dead Rabbits.

20
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:37,915
Which are you?

21
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,045
What do you think?
Dead Rabbits!

22
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:22,086
Well,well, Monk!

23
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,136
Are you with us
or not?

24
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,846
For the last time Vallon,
only if the money is right.

25
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,686
I'll give you 10 per notch.

26
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,307
10?

27
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,437
You have my word.

28
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,737
10 per notch. Per new notch.

29
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:49,037
Then I'm your man.

30
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,520
Is this it, Priest?
The Pope's new army?

31
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,900
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags!

32
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,990
I know Bill. You swore, this was
a battle between warriors.

33
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,911
Not a bunch of Miss Nancy's.

34
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,701
So warriors is what I brought.

35
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,921
The O'Connell Guard!

36
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,331
The Plug Uglies!

37
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,001
The Shirt Tails!

38
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,641
The Chichesters!

39
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,601
The Forty Thieves!

40
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,021
Bene.

41
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:34,452
On my challenge, by the ancient
laws of combat...

42
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,332
...we are met at
this chosen ground...

43
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,672
...to settle for good and all...

44
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:42,882
...who holds sway,
over the Five Points.

45
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:49,932
Us Natives, born rightwise
to this fine land....

46
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,262
...or the foreign hordes
defiling it!

47
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:02,523
Under the ancient laws of combat
I accept the challenge of the so called Natives.

48
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,363
You plague our people at
every turn!

49
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:08,533
But from this day out, you
shall plague us no more!

50
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,283
Let it be known, that the hand
that tries to strike us from this land...

51
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:14,243
...shall be swiflty cut down!

52
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:22,583
Then may the Christian Lord, guide
my hand, against your Roman popery!

53
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,883
Prepare to receive
the true Lord!

54
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:29,297
Priest!

55
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:19,558
Look at me!

56
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:24,149
Who is this under my knife?

57
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:34,909
Father, get up! Get up!

58
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:36,949
Where are you?

59
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:38,619
Where are you?

60
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,169
No, my son.

61
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,339
Don't never look away!

62
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,230
Soon be over, Priest.

63
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,110
Finish it!

64
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,420
You may need this to cross
the river.

65
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,851
Ears and noses will be the
trophies of the day.

66
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:40,231
But no hand shall touch him!

67
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,111
No hand shall touch him!

68
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,031
He'll cross over whole!

69
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:52,611
In honour!

70
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,531
Not before I get what's owed!

71
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:03,881
No!

72
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:09,592
It's fair. A touch indelicate,
but fair.

73
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,222
My sympathies.

74
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:19,312
What shall we do with
the boy?

75
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,142
Look at me.

76
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:29,192
Give him to the law.

77
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:31,902
See he gets a good
education.

78
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,202
Okay, boss. Say goodbye
to your father.

79
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,043
Hey. Take it easy!

80
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:49,633
Hurry! Come in here!

81
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,824
Come here, boy. You're
going to Hell's Gate!

82
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:14,784
There he is!

83
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:15,404
Get him!

84
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,994
Priest Vallon died a
noble death.

85
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:23,124
But his Dead Rabbits is done
and outlawed.

86
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,294
Let no one even speak their
name from now on.

87
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:20,645
In this place, you've
grown from a boy into a man.

88
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,026
Put to death the earthly
things in you.

89
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:28,776
Immorality. Impurity.
Passion. Vengeance.

90
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,776
The Lord has forgiven you.

91
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,326
You also must forgive.

92
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:41,576
You go forth to a country torn
apart by civil strife.

93
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:43,036
Thank you, Reverend.

94
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:50,176
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains.

95
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,256
That this war may end.

96
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:56,807
And the plague of slavery,
that brought this confergration down upon us  ...

97
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:01,097
...vanish forever
from the earth.

98
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,508
In the second year of the
great civil war...

99
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,598
...when the irish brigades
marched through the streets...

100
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,808
...New york was a city
full of tribes.

101
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,398
War chiefs. Rich and poor.

102
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,318
Lincoln will make all
white men slaves!

103
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,738
It wasn't a city really.

104
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:51,858
It was more a furnace.

105
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:55,408
Where cities someday
might be forged.

106
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,158
That's the spirit boys.

107
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,158
Go off and die for your
blackie friends.

108
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,919
We should have run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

109
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,459
They are trying to say ,we
are no different than niggers.

110
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,009
You ain't.

111
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,889
Go back to Africa,
niggers!

112
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,769
The angriest talk was of
the new conscription act.

113
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,319
The first draft in Union
history.

114
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,040
Join the army lads. Three square
meals a day and good pay.

115
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,090
When the Irish came, the city was
in a fever.

116
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,510
Since the time of the great famine
they'd come streaming off the boats.

117
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,340
And they got a right warm welcome.

118
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,220
Go back to Ireland, you
dumb Mick!

119
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,970
You'll remember that!

120
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,560
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

121
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,230
I came only 2 hours down
river from Hell Gate...

122
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,810
..but they all took me
for an immigrant.

123
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,110
Why not?

124
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,190
There were a 1000 different
accents in New York..

125
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,401
..and to the Natives you see,
they were all the same.

126
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:18,701
Come here to take the chill off
your soul and the weight off your heart.

127
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,951
Welcome to America son, your long
arduous journey is over.

128
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,501
Go back to your own country.

129
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,671
Vote Tammany!

130
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,831
America for Americans!

131
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:37,141
New York loved William
Tweed and hated him.

132
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,141
And those of us trying
to be thieves....

133
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,681
...we couldn't help but
admire him.

134
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,681
Mr. Cutting. Gentlemen.

135
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,731
Thank you for coming.
It's an honour.

136
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:46,852
Mr. Tweed?

137
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,982
Sir! Please! Excuse me?

138
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:53,692
I think your're frightening
them.

139
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:54,572
So?

140
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:57,162
Don't mind him, he used to
be an Irishman.

141
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:01,832
The Five Points!

142
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:05,002
Murderer's Alley. Brickbat Mansion.

143
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,172
The Gates of hell!

144
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,632
In this wild place....

145
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,172
Look upon the face of this
poor child.

146
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:20,473
She lives in squalor, in this
godforsaken den of vice and
misery behind me.

147
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,223
Every year the Reformers came.

148
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:25,773
Every year the Points got
worse.

149
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,353
As if it liked being dirty.

150
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:31,863
Where am I going to go?

151
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:32,323
Move.

152
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:33,653
The Reverend wants you out
of here.

153
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:51,673
You may or not know Bill, that every
day I go down to the waterfront...

154
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:54,094
...with hot soup for the Irish
as they come on shore.

155
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,214
As part of building a political
base.

156
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:58,224
I've noticed you there.

157
00:19:58,674 --> 00:19:59,934
You may have noticed me?

158
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:00,934
Indeed I have!

159
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:05,104
Throwing torrents of favours and
withering abuse on every person who
step off those boats.

160
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,064
If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed...

161
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:10,484
...I'd shoot each and everyone of them,
before they set foot on American soil.

162
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:46,725
Mulbeery street and Worth. Cross.
Orange and Littlewater.

163
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,565
Each of the Five Points is a
finger...

164
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:53,985
...when I close my hand
it becomes a fist.

165
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:59,445
And any time that I wish, I
can turn it against you.

166
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,705
I understand. But we're talking
about different things.

167
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:05,456
I'm talking about civic duty.
Responsibilites we owe to the people.

168
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:08,546
Schools and hospitals. Sewers
and utilities.

169
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:12,836
Street construction, repairs and
sweeping. Business and saloon licences...

170
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:36,367
St. Michael the Archangel...

171
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,577
Defend us in battle.

172
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:42,617
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

173
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,917
Streetcars, ferries,
rubbish disposal.

174
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:48,587
There's a power of money to
be made in this city, Bill.

175
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:52,627
With your help, the people must
be made to understand...

176
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:57,467
...that all these things are best
kept, in what I like to call the
Tammany family.

177
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:01,517
That is why I am talking about
an alliance between our organisations.

178
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:04,267
You're talking about muscle
work.

179
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,647
That too. Muscle to match
our spirit.

180
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:08,817
You own the crushers, get
them to do it.

181
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,478
The police? Oh, no! Jezus,no!

182
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:14,108
The appearance of the law must
be upheld.

183
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,908
Especially while it's been
broken.

184
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,548
Give me the strength, for what I
must do.

185
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:35,968
Who are you?

186
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:44,138
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

187
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,569
I just like it down here
is all.

188
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:58,279
See what's in his pockets,
Jimmy.

189
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,329
Now look, boys. I really don't
want to fight.

190
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,449
You don't want to fight?

191
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,699
Don't worry, son. Ain't gonna
be much of a fight.

192
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,009
Don't kill me.

193
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,270
Where did you get that?

194
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,930
I told you I didn't want
to fight!

195
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,770
Why not?

196
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,610
Look how good you done.

197
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,200
You're the priest's son
aren't you?

198
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,870
You! Get away from me.
You understand?

199
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,910
You don't remember me, do you?

200
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,500
I was the one tried to help
you.

201
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,170
What?

202
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,341
I was the one tried to help
you.

203
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:53,631
When the Natives took you.

204
00:23:58,631 --> 00:23:59,051
That was you?

205
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,971
Yeah. I thought you was killed.

206
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,811
They just locked me up
You know that.

207
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,061
This long?

208
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:12,271
I kept trying to escape, you know.

209
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,361
Did more time for that.

210
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:17,821
So what are you doing back
here?

211
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:21,111
Guess I missed the place.

212
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:29,662
Bowery boys.

213
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:46,562
The Five Points.
Paradise square!

214
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:49,432
The streets here are always
livelier in the evening.

215
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:52,692
Who are the gangs around now?

216
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:55,312
We got the Daybreak boys
and the Swamp Angels.

217
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,862
They work the River
Luton ships.

218
00:24:57,282 --> 00:25:00,242
The Frog Haulers shanghai sailors
down around the bay.

219
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:04,283
Shortails were rough for awhile,
but they became a bunch of jackrolling
dandies.

220
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,833
Lolling around Murderer's Alley
looking like Chinamen.

221
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,623
Hellcat Maggie she tried to open
up her own grog shop.

222
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,923
But she drunk up all her own
liquor and got thrown out
on the street.

223
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,003
Now she's on the lay
for everything.

224
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,003
The Plug Uglies they're from
somewhere in the old country.

225
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:19,133
They got their own language.

226
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:20,473
No one understands what they're
saying.

227
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,013
They love to fight the cops.

228
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:24,723
And the Nightwalkers and Ratpickers.

229
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,893
They work on their backs and
kill with their hands.

230
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:28,933
They're so scurvy, only the
Plug Uglies...

231
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:29,723
...will talk with them.

232
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:31,273
But who knows what they're
saying.

233
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:36,024
The Slaughterhouses and the
Broadway Twisters are a fine
bunch of Bengal boys!

234
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:37,364
And the little  Forty Thieves.

235
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:38,944
I used to run with them
for a while.

236
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,904
Till they got taken over by
Benjer the Cockroach and his red
eyed buggers.

237
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,154
Benjer is a germ.

238
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:44,744
If you try to leave the
gang, they say...

239
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,954
...he hacks the blood off you.

240
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:50,084
The righteousness are nothing but
a bunch of repetitious grab ups..

241
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,254
The True Blue Americans call
themselves a gang...

242
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:56,464
...but all they really do is stand
around on corners damning Engeland.

243
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:59,214
Do you believe one word that
the British say...?

244
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:02,224
Anything about the sand of
the Dead Rabbits?

245
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:08,184
You don't say that name!

246
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,475
That name died with your...

247
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:12,645
It's been outlawed.

248
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,235
When I was in the blockhouse,
the chinks told me...

249
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,945
...that the Natives celebrate
their victory...

250
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,115
....every year.

251
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:20,825
Is that true?

252
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:22,535
Aye, that they do.

253
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:23,905
It's quite a fair.

254
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,665
The Butcher himself has got
to invite you...

255
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:26,535
...or you don't go.

256
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:39,215
Look where you are going, Johnny!

257
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:44,926
You look stunned and
poorly, sir!

258
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,436
Quite a pair of conversationists
aren't you!

259
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:58,276
Maybe not. We're deep
thinkers.

260
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,996
Gentlemen, I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord!

261
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,627
Jenny, finest bludget in all
the Points.

262
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:21,427
She is a prim looking
star gazer!

263
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,847
But I'd check my pockets
if I were you.

264
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,937
Because I do believe she lifted
your time piece.

265
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:35,147
I let her take it.

266
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,067
I let here take things all
the time.

267
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:40,237
Is that right?

268
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:41,027
Yeah.

269
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:49,207
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

270
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,088
You generally pick up a swag
and if the cops came along...

271
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,208
...you really got a show.

272
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,928
The municipal police fought
the metropolitan police.

273
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:03,048
The metropolitan police fought
the streetgangs.

274
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,638
Hurry up before the Black
Joke get here!

275
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,808
There were 37 amateur fire-
brigades.

276
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,638
They all fought each other.

277
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:11,518
The Black Joke are on
their way!

278
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:22,568
Okay boys, get the hoses!

279
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:31,249
It's the Black Joke!

280
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,379
Go get 'm boys!

281
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,549
Give those Bowery boys
help!

282
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:38,709
Quick before there's nothing
left!

283
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,679
Go back to the Bowery,
ya bum!

284
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,679
For gods sake. They're taking
everything!

285
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,509
In your next time of trouble
ma'm....

286
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:46,969
...call Tammany first!

287
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:49,099
It's not too late. You can
still save my house!

288
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:51,519
Let's go!

289
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,019
I thought you said you
were hungry!

290
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,990
Grab what you can. Let's get
out of here!

291
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,580
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

292
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,700
And may I point out that this
area is the provenance...

293
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,290
..of my own America's firebrigade.

294
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,000
And that you lot only belong
in the Bowery.

295
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
May I point out that you are
outmanned, outmanouvered...

296
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,010
...and at the moment outfought!

297
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,130
Am I?

298
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,480
There's the Black Joke!

299
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,851
Let's get 'm!

300
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,071
Clear the way for
Bill the Butcher.

301
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,861
Okay boys, to work!

302
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,201
What's the point?

303
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,911
The fire's near burnt eveything
of value inside.

304
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:50,581
Boys forget that one.
Next building over.

305
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,041
Mustn't let it spread!

306
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,501
Grab what you want from
that one!

307
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,751
What are you doing? There's
nothing wrong with this one!

308
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,402
Come on. Johnny. Get up!

309
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:22,822
Leave that.

310
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,252
You two, on your way!

311
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:51,563
His name's Amsterdam.

312
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:55,693
How's the beak?

313
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:57,443
Ain't so bad.

314
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:01,153
You. You got anything or you
can get out.

315
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:14,043
Is that it?

316
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,164
That's it.

317
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,134
Right. Here's the rake.

318
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:22,174
Everything comes here we
fence it.

319
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,724
Johnny takes our tribute to the
Natives and we chop up....

320
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:28,724
....the winnings, each to his
equal portion of the gang.

321
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,014
Does that meet with your
approval, Hell Gate?

322
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:34,604
My approval?

323
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,774
What's the matter Jack Sprat,
can't you think for yourself!

324
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,734
I'll slit your fucking throat!

325
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:50,745
You boys settle with me, before
settling with each other.

326
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,045
I come for my due
and proper.

327
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,355
This ain't a bad haul.

328
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:22,525
You know, when the folks say the
country is going to hell...

329
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:25,946
...I always tell them, look at
all the hard work...

330
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,826
..our fine young lads are doing
down in the Points.

331
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:33,706
Oh, yeah. This is just the
thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

332
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:38,296
Alright Happy Jack. Leave us for
something to give Bill de Butcher.

333
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:39,416
Would ya?

334
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:53,976
Not my favorite tune.

335
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,157
Thank you, boys.

336
00:33:04,987 --> 00:33:06,697
You keep out of trouble
now.

337
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:30,177
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again.

338
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:35,058
At Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott street.

339
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,608
The chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

340
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:47,868
The drum rolls and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

341
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:56,748
When you kill a king, you don't
stab him in the dark.

342
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:04,088
You kill him where the whole
court can watch him die.

343
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,809
Got any timber?

344
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,030
Hi, Maggie. Rightie or leftie?

345
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,860
Give us a drink.

346
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,950
Help yourself.

347
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,410
Two minutes. Place
your bets.

348
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:17,831
Gentlemen. The match is due
to commence.

349
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:21,541
The count to be is,
25 rodents in 3 minutes.

350
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,251
Rouser against the vermin.

351
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:25,261
Satisfied?

352
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,301
50!

353
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:26,841
Yes!

354
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:42,771
Where are you going, boil?

355
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,031
I'm here to pay tribute
to Bill.

356
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:45,861
Are you now?

357
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:47,612
Give it to me. I'll give
it to him.

358
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:49,322
No thanks. I'll give it to
him myself.

359
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,792
What do you want to keep, the
money or your teeth?

360
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:55,372
John?

361
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:58,042
Welcome.

362
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,342
From me and the lads, sir.

363
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:17,232
Mate of yours?

364
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:18,522
Where's he from?

365
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:21,402
He's not from here, sir.

366
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:25,823
YOU!

367
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,383
That's close enough!

368
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:59,024
Your friend can't look me
in the eye...

369
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:00,984
...that's not an admirable
characteristic.

370
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:03,694
No one can look you in the
eye, Bill..

371
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:05,524
...not when you're playing
cards.

372
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:27,344
This is whist, it's a
gentleman's game.

373
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:28,554
Make a gentleman's bet.

374
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:30,175
I am betting large, Bill!

375
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:31,765
That ain't large.

376
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:43,565
Don't make that noise
again, Harvey.

377
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,035
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

378
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:56,205
How do you fair on water?
Come closer.

379
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,495
Closer. I ain't gonna bite!

380
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,796
There's a Portugese ship lying
low in the harbour....

381
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:07,636
...quarantined three weeks.

382
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:10,096
Get there before the Day Break
Boys strip her.

383
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:11,636
Maybe you and me wil talk
some more.

384
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:12,676
Consider it done, sir.

385
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:13,516
Good boy.

386
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:16,266
And you...

387
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:17,056
...whatever you name is.

388
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:17,896
What is your name?

389
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:23,816
Amsterdam, sir.

390
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:25,946
Amsterdam?

391
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:28,616
I'm New York.

392
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,786
Don't you ever come in
here empty handed again.

393
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:34,206
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

394
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:36,916
Take him for a boat ride, John.

395
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,957
Maybe he'll save your life
again.

396
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:47,427
If the Day Break boys catch us on
this river, they'll slit our throats!

397
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,847
I'll do it myself, if you don't
keep quiet!

398
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:52,717
I never liked the harbour
after dark.

399
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:57,147
And now each night they brought
on shore the bodies of the soldiers.

400
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:01,107
So many mothers don't even have the solace
of knowing where their sons have fallen.

401
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:04,317
I lost my own eldest in Antida.

402
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,407
His mother and I weren't able
to recover his remains.

403
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:08,697
It was a mournful sight.

404
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,237
The war can't last forever.

405
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:12,328
But we had business of our
own.

406
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:23,708
The Day Break boys have already
been here.

407
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,468
There's nothing left. Let's
go back.

408
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:31,468
What in hell...?

409
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:41,148
Jimmy..get down!

410
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:46,899
Jezus..that'll bring the
harbour cops for sure!

411
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:47,739
Out of the way!

412
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:56,579
Let's take a look.

413
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:02,339
Jezus..they killed everybody!

414
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:03,799
There's nothing here but...

415
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,919
Watch it....dead sea crabs.

416
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,219
Come on! Let's go.

417
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:10,759
Shove off!

418
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:12,469
No. Wait for Amsterdam!

419
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:13,509
Where is Amsterdam?

420
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,519
Take him, damn fool!

421
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,519
What in the hell for?

422
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,940
Look in my glims. I said no
less than 15!

423
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,190
Is this fresh?

424
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,650
Four hours most.

425
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,280
Much obliged, gents.

426
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,620
What's that word?

427
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,620
It means bodysnatchers.

428
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,920
I didn't ask the meaning.
I asked the word.

429
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,670
Ghoul?

430
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,840
Ghoul?

431
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,220
That's a good word.

432
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,971
A fresh outrage in the
Five Points.

433
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:57,971
A notice that you can
be proud of.

434
00:40:58,431 --> 00:40:58,851
Thank you.

435
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:02,101
Low thing, to do that to
a body.

436
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,021
Low.

437
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:05,271
Why? They could've left that
ship with nothing.

438
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:06,861
Instead they made the Police
Gazette.

439
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:08,691
A periodical of note.

440
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:11,861
A body is supposed to stay
beneath the earth....

441
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,411
...wearing a wooden coat...

442
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:15,241
..until the resurrection.

443
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,871
These two are just a pair of
bug eating sons of Irish bitches.
Just like you.

444
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:20,041
Don't seem to bother them none.

445
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:23,171
Maybe they don't share your
religious scruples.

446
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,461
Maybe they're just a couple
of fiddeling bends.

447
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:33,762
I've been called a lot of things,
mister...

448
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:35,012
...but I've never been called..?

449
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:37,602
Fiddeling bends.

450
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:38,472
Fiddeling bends. Right.

451
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:43,942
If I knew what in the hell
that meant..

452
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:46,442
...I might be inclined to
take offense.

453
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:49,482
A fiddeling bend is a fellow
who would steal anything...

454
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:51,032
...dead or alive.

455
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:54,452
Because he's too low to work up a
decent lay for himself.

456
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:55,782
Count that careful.

457
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:58,202
I'm telling you that's all there
is. That's all they gave us.

458
00:41:58,202 --> 00:41:58,872
That's all they gave us.

459
00:41:58,872 --> 00:41:59,452
Chiseler!

460
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,913
If you had said chiseler, now
that's a word I understand.

461
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:05,173
Is that what you're calling us?

462
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:07,673
I can think of a number of things
to call you, boil!

463
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:10,593
Right. But I asked if you was
calling us chiselers?

464
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:13,383
Supposing I am?

465
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:17,643
Well, then we got business.

466
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,103
That we do!

467
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,073
2 dollars on McGloin!

468
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:34,653
5 pieces on the kid!

469
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:36,364
5 on Amsterdam!

470
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:48,294
Come on, McGloin, it's
just a kid.

471
00:42:59,854 --> 00:43:01,684
Watch his left, McGloin!

472
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,475
Alright, that'll do.

473
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:44,726
What do you say now, huh?

474
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:46,736
That'll do, for Christ sake.

475
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:47,736
Drag him off.

476
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:49,196
That's enough, kid.

477
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,316
You got him.

478
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:23,107
McGloin? How would that head
look without the ears and nose on it?

479
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,527
You'd better leave that head
alone, Bill.

480
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:31,487
I think I'm gonna trim the beak
and the ears off that head.

481
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:34,697
Make a nice pot of soup out of
that head.

482
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:36,907
You can find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

483
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:40,367
I ain't got no stomach
for an Irish stew.

484
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:45,377
The mighty McGloin.

485
00:44:45,957 --> 00:44:48,007
Almost fish hooked by
a sprat.

486
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,808
On the seventh day the Lord rested.

487
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:01,268
But before that He did...

488
00:45:01,848 --> 00:45:03,978
...He squatted over the side
of England...

489
00:45:03,978 --> 00:45:07,858
...and what came out of him?
Ireland!

490
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:09,108
No offense, son.

491
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:10,398
None taken, sir.

492
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:11,858
I grew up here.

493
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:15,828
AllI ever knew of Ireland was in
the talk of others in the asylum.

494
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:21,328
From which part of that
excrementitous island were your
forebares spawn?

495
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,998
I've been told Carrey.

496
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:26,458
But I lost proof of it in my
language in the asylum.

497
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,879
I was raised in a similar
establishment myself.

498
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:34,429
Everything you see belongs to
me, to degree or another.

499
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,969
But beggars, quick thieves,
here in Paradise..

500
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:41,429
...gymmills, blind tigers on
the waterfront...

501
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:44,599
...anglers and the musers. The
she-he's and the chinks.

502
00:45:44,899 --> 00:45:47,019
Everybody owes...

503
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:48,149
...everybody pays, because...

504
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:52,149
...that's how you stand up,
to the rising of the tide.

505
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:54,199
Is that right boys?

506
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,199
Yes Bill, that's right.

507
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:58,159
Enlist. Join up! Serve
your country.

508
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,920
Volunteer and get your 50
dollar bonus!

509
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,630
We need 30,000 volunteers..

510
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,670
...and we're prepared to pay
677 dollar per volunteer.

511
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,630
Please read this. Thank you.

512
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,800
Would you like one to
fill out?

513
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,510
3 square meals a day.

514
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,310
3 square meals a day.
Young man?

515
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,520
Enlist and...

516
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,390
...serve you country.

517
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,060
3 square meals a day, gentlemen!

518
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,810
If you're interested, I suggest...

519
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,530
Everywhere you went, people
talked about the daft.

520
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,780
You could buy your way
out for 300 dollars.

521
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,701
But who had 300 dollars?

522
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,831
For us it had might as well
been 3 millions.

523
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:41,791
The recruters were too scared
of the gangs...

524
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,251
...to come after us.

525
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,711
Besides, we never dreamt the war..

526
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:48,421
...would ever touch
New York.

527
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:49,671
Good morning, sir.

528
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:52,511
You!

529
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:54,721
Don't you run into me.

530
00:46:56,841 --> 00:46:57,551
Fair enough!

531
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:04,851
I said don't run in to me!

532
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:06,561
Sorry!

533
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:14,612
Everything in place?

534
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:16,572
It seems so.

535
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:19,872
Then I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord.

536
00:47:20,282 --> 00:47:21,032
Thank you.

537
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:31,712
Why that dirty...!

538
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:37,882
Oh, no!

539
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:40,262
Allow me!

540
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:44,853
Thank you kindly, sir.

541
00:47:45,313 --> 00:47:46,483
It's my pleasure.

542
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:49,023
I hope you don't mind if
I speak...

543
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:51,363
..I don't want to appear forward.

544
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:56,033
Well sir, that depends on what you
say!

545
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,213
Would you call me wreckless, if I say
that you are the prettiest girl
in New York?

546
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:11,583
Only New York?

547
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:15,213
This is my stop.

548
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,974
May I walk with you a little
then?

549
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:23,604
That sir...would be too bold.

550
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,545
For every lay we had a
different name.

551
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,845
An Angler put a hook on the
end of a stick...

552
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:59,515
...to drop behind store
windows and doors.

553
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,975
An Autumn diver picked your
pocket in church.

554
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:06,565
A Badger, gets a fellow in bed
with a girl...

555
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:09,315
..and robs his pockets when
they're on the go.

556
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:11,985
Jenny was a Bludger..

557
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:13,865
...a girl pickpocket.

558
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:16,735
And a Turtle dove.

559
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,995
A Turtle dove goes uptown...

560
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:22,995
...dressed like a housemaid.

561
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,285
Picks out a fine house...

562
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:28,836
...and goes right through the
back door. Robs you blind.

563
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:33,626
It takes a lot of sand to
be a Turtle dove.

564
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,196
I'll have my medal back.

565
00:49:57,446 --> 00:49:58,486
Oh, jezus.

566
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:07,627
Don't do that again.

567
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,507
I said, don't do that!

568
00:50:11,377 --> 00:50:13,757
Go back to the Points
and let me do my business...

569
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:15,887
...or I will open your throat.

570
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:21,217
Alright.

571
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:25,187
Go on then.

572
00:50:28,397 --> 00:50:29,317
I would.

573
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:32,817
Go on then.

574
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:58,218
Give me back my medal.

575
00:50:58,678 --> 00:50:59,678
Make it quick.

576
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,859
I don't know which one's
yours.

577
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:19,529
Suppose I help myself to
everything.

578
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,039
Suppose you do.

579
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,450
Shall I walk with you a
little, then?

580
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,471
What do you suppose a fellow
can earn up here in a day?

581
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:19,631
Maybe we can pile in together?

582
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:22,761
I think you're a bit rough for
this game.

583
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:25,311
Besides, I work alone.

584
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:26,931
Alone?

585
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:29,061
What do you core to
the Butcher?

586
00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:29,941
Nothing.

587
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:31,351
Nothing?

588
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:33,771
The Butcher and me have a
special arrangement.

589
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:43,121
I don't want to see
you again!

590
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,531
I don't blame you.

591
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,911
Pennies in their pockets and
hope in their eyes.

592
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:50,832
They peer to the west.

593
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:54,962
Searching the horizon for a
glimpse of land and salvation.

594
00:52:57,962 --> 00:52:59,552
A glimpse of America.

595
00:53:00,092 --> 00:53:03,142
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Mrs. Schermerhorn?

596
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:06,562
Some days the uptown gangs
came to us.

597
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:10,692
The Schermerhorns were one of the
oldest families in New York.

598
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,312
They didn't run the city..

599
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,822
...but they were listened to quite
carefully, by them who did.

600
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:17,402
Commissioner Brunt, said you
wanted to view the Points....

601
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,442
...in all its splendor an
squalor.

602
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:22,242
Spare nothing concerning the
conditions, said he!

603
00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:25,413
Nothing except our safety,
constable.

604
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:29,453
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's
company, my dear!

605
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:31,583
Quite so, madam. Witness!

606
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:41,593
Shall we continue on?

607
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,183
You dare to leave it there?

608
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:44,973
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greely.

609
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,643
They all know it's mine.

610
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:49,643
Is that man drunk?

611
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:52,273
Dead as good friday, miss.

612
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:58,904
Good day, Mulraney.

613
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,074
Boys?

614
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:00,444
Jack?

615
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:02,034
Slum socialable?

616
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,324
Track finding. Reform studying.

617
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:05,494
May I present...

618
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:09,744
The Schermerhorns hardly require
an introduction from you, Jack.

619
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,794
Mrs. Schermerhorn and her
daughter.

620
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:12,874
The gentleman of course is...

621
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,964
Mr. Greely. The famous
publisher.

622
00:54:14,964 --> 00:54:16,084
It's a pleasure and an
honour, sir.

623
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:18,094
Of the Tribune.

624
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:19,174
I am William Cutting.

625
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:22,344
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

626
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:26,644
As of this moment,
extremely well.

627
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:27,684
How do you do?

628
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:31,184
Orange blossom. Delicious!

629
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:33,185
Mr. Cutting is...

630
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,945
What a peach! You had a fine
carreer on the stage.

631
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,775
...one of the Five Points local...

632
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,615
Please to meet you, sir.

633
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:39,985
..leaders.

634
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:40,785
Mr. Greely!

635
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:41,825
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cutting.

636
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:42,695
The Five Points welcomes you..

637
00:54:42,695 --> 00:54:43,955
...to these streets...

638
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:45,915
..and you shall pas in
safety.

639
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,665
I'll see to their safety.

640
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,285
Thank you, Bill.

641
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:51,835
This way.

642
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:53,205
Good day lads.

643
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,255
Criminals who brag
a dote show.

644
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:56,425
He knows who I am!

645
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:58,715
Inderdeed, sir. You are well
known in these parts.

646
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:03,675
I find that strangely flattering.

647
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,095
Never did like crushers.

648
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,136
Well draw it mild, son.

649
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:09,556
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without me telling him to.

650
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,706
Do you think my watch would be
safe in that lamp post, Bill?

651
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,706
Why don't you hang it
up there and see?

652
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:35,126
Some day.

653
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:38,546
Some day is right.

654
00:55:40,427 --> 00:55:41,427
Is this the new lad?

655
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:47,187
just another bastard I folded
in the warmth of my embrace.

656
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:51,727
Hey!

657
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:53,317
Just wanted to see your face,
son.

658
00:55:54,277 --> 00:55:55,317
No harm intended.

659
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:21,388
You get to know a lot by
butchering meat.

660
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:25,518
We're made up of the same
things.

661
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:28,638
Flesh and blood. Tissue. Organs.

662
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,768
I love to work with pigs.

663
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:37,068
The nearest thing in nature to
the flesh of a man, is the
flesh a pig.

664
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:39,198
Pig, huh?

665
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:39,898
That's right.

666
00:56:40,908 --> 00:56:41,948
This is for you, mother.

667
00:56:45,908 --> 00:56:46,618
Here you are.

668
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:48,829
God bless you.

669
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:51,829
She ain't really my mother.

670
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:53,919
I knew that, Bill.

671
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:00,259
This is the liver.

672
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:04,929
The kidneys. The heart.

673
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:09,019
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

674
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:10,519
This is a kill.

675
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:12,399
This is a kill.

676
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:15,689
And the artery. This is a kill.

677
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:19,149
You try it.

678
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,160
Go ahead.

679
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,770
Don't follow the blade
on the rib.

680
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:53,980
Very good!

681
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:54,900
And the artery.

682
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,651
Bleed 'm slow. Let them think
about it for a while.

683
00:57:58,651 --> 00:57:59,611
Slow death.

684
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:00,321
Good!

685
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:04,861
You'll each bill the city
5000 dollars a month...

686
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,161
..for supplies and services..

687
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:07,781
...for which you will
receive 10%.

688
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:12,161
Bill! Mr. Glour will work out
the details. Thank you.

689
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:14,501
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

690
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:16,331
Who's this?

691
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:19,631
Thank you, boys.

692
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:21,211
Good day, sir.

693
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:35,522
You got something on
your mind?

694
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:40,942
Bill's taking quite a liking
to you.

695
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:45,362
If you're up to something..

696
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:50,122
...I don't want no
part in it.

697
00:58:55,212 --> 00:58:57,082
I was in Hell Gate for
16 years.

698
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:00,842
I'm just trying to make my
way is all...

699
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:02,802
...just like you.

700
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:06,553
Less of course you got
a better notion?

701
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:09,103
No.

702
00:59:10,973 --> 00:59:13,983
I can't get a days work
done...

703
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,103
...for all the good citizens
coming here..

704
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:17,733
...harrassing me about
crime in the Points.

705
00:59:18,563 --> 00:59:22,023
Some even go so far to accuse
Tammany of connivance..

706
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:24,743
..in this so called rampant
criminality.

707
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:27,033
What can I do?
I can't have this.

708
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,283
Something has to be done.

709
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:29,663
What do you have in mind?

710
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,743
I don't know. Maybe we
should hang someone.

711
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,043
Who?

712
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:37,963
No one important necessarily.

713
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:40,544
Back alley thieves, with
no affiliations.

714
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:42,304
How many?

715
00:59:42,884 --> 00:59:43,844
3 or 4.

716
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:46,174
Which?

717
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:47,594
Vier.

718
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:53,894
You stand here convicted..

719
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,354
...of ludeness, jackrolling...

720
00:59:56,354 --> 01:00:01,614
...sneak thievery, chloral
hydrating, sodomy..

721
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:07,204
...strangulation and corruption
of the public good.

722
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:11,784
Chin up.

723
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:13,745
Handsome bunch of gallows
food!

724
01:00:13,745 --> 01:00:14,495
There's my old friend.

725
01:00:14,495 --> 01:00:15,625
How are you feeling, Arthur?

726
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,215
I'm okay. Okay you know.

727
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,585
Say hello to Amsterdam.
He nearly fish hooked McGloin.

728
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:21,335
Nearly!

729
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:23,635
I see that you are dressed for
the occasion, Arthur.

730
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:26,305
You know me, Bill. Always
like to look me best.

731
01:00:26,305 --> 01:00:27,475
That's the spirit.

732
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,095
Nice locket. I'll give you
a dollar for it.

733
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,305
It's me mother's.

734
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:35,355
Dollar and a halve?

735
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:37,185
Done.

736
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:42,905
I'll miss you, Arthur.

737
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:44,825
See you in the hot
country, Shamus.

738
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:54,956
Is my son present here?

739
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,206
Where's my little fellow?

740
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:01,426
Look at your dad.

741
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:04,256
Farewell dear boy.

742
01:01:05,846 --> 01:01:08,846
I never struck a foul blow..

743
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:10,976
..or turned a card.

744
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:15,226
May God greet me as a friend!

745
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:50,307
That night the Reformers
held a dance.

746
01:01:50,727 --> 01:01:52,307
That was the Five Points
alright....

747
01:01:53,267 --> 01:01:56,268
...hangings in the morning,
a dance in the evening.

748
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:57,858
To be sure!

749
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:01,738
It's not a matter of words,
but by the way she smiles at me.

750
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:03,448
She smiles at a lot of
people, John.

751
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:07,738
A penny, for a fighting
Irishman?

752
01:02:12,158 --> 01:02:12,908
Are you from Carey?

753
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,288
I am sir.

754
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:17,458
It ain't much.

755
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:18,788
Thank you.

756
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,378
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
delighted to see so many young faces..

757
01:02:23,378 --> 01:02:25,758
...at our first annual
mission dance.

758
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:27,508
This will be a real circus!

759
01:02:27,928 --> 01:02:30,679
The mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

760
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:34,059
...and we are happy to greet
our Roman catholic friends...

761
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:36,229
...who join us here tonight.

762
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:39,649
Ladies....come with me.

763
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:43,399
We're going to start the dance
in just a moment.

764
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:48,659
Good evening, your Holyness.

765
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:52,619
Good evening, Reverend.

766
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:55,079
You should have shaved
closer!

767
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,089
Good evening, Reverend.

768
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:02,550
I'd like to make a pardon.

769
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,090
Miss...?

770
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,230
Everdeane.

771
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,140
Miss Everdeane.

772
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,030
Gentlemen, over here! If
you don't mind.

773
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:33,120
Thank you.

774
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,410
Open it. Hold it up!

775
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,001
Into the mirror.

776
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:34,062
That one!

777
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:38,642
Our queen has chosen.

778
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,083
Sir...

779
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:01,083
...your lady!

780
01:05:02,793 --> 01:05:05,963
Regular services are held in
the church at 6 and 8.

781
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:06,803
Go to hell.

782
01:05:16,393 --> 01:05:17,523
What do you think your
doing?

783
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:18,643
I'm dancing.

784
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:19,814
Why did you pick me?

785
01:05:20,644 --> 01:05:21,944
That's none of your business.

786
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:23,564
Would you mind telling me?

787
01:05:24,814 --> 01:05:25,274
Sorry!

788
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,284
I'm not much of a dancer.

789
01:05:33,574 --> 01:05:34,874
Try and stay calm.

790
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:37,584
I've never been to a dance
before!

791
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:38,874
It's best not to look down.

792
01:05:42,044 --> 01:05:43,464
You can hold me tighter if
you like.

793
01:05:52,184 --> 01:05:52,594
Alright.

794
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:53,135
Okay!

795
01:05:56,015 --> 01:05:57,475
Why didn't you dance
with Johnny?

796
01:06:00,275 --> 01:06:01,315
Because...

797
01:06:04,195 --> 01:06:05,735
...I didn't want him.

798
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:06,127
I'm not good in this.

799
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:14,977
Wait!

800
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:15,267
What?

801
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:16,017
Wait.

802
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:18,977
How does this open?

803
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:20,857
It takes too long to lace
back up...

804
01:07:21,267 --> 01:07:22,317
...we'll be here all night.

805
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:36,328
Alright. I'll take it off.

806
01:07:59,268 --> 01:08:01,018
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

807
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:06,988
Sorry!

808
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:10,449
It's fine.

809
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:16,449
Have you got any scars?

810
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:19,999
A few.

811
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:20,021
What's that then?

812
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:21,691
That?

813
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:24,111
A gift from Mr. Cutting.

814
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:30,281
A gift?

815
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:32,861
A gift!

816
01:09:35,121 --> 01:09:36,121
Was it your birthday?

817
01:09:37,871 --> 01:09:38,701
No.

818
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:44,881
What did you give him?

819
01:09:48,301 --> 01:09:50,131
The answer to that has nothing
to do with you.

820
01:09:57,682 --> 01:09:59,852
Don't tell me you're angry
with me?

821
01:09:59,852 --> 01:10:02,142
No..I'm through with you.

822
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:09,862
Well, you're quicker then
most fellows...

823
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:12,072
...generally they wait till
afterwards!

824
01:10:12,072 --> 01:10:14,362
I ain't interested..

825
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:15,282
...in the Butcher's leavings.

826
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:37,643
Stay away from the pikers.

827
01:10:37,643 --> 01:10:39,763
15 to 1. Bug Eye Ward!

828
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:40,773
Amsterdam!

829
01:10:41,523 --> 01:10:43,353
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

830
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:45,063
We ran his errands..

831
01:10:45,063 --> 01:10:45,983
...made his money...

832
01:10:45,983 --> 01:10:46,693
...took a piece...

833
01:10:46,693 --> 01:10:47,943
...and said thank you, sir.

834
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:48,943
Gentlemen in the ring!

835
01:10:49,363 --> 01:10:50,783
Even Tweed!

836
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:52,363
The fight's over!

837
01:10:52,363 --> 01:10:53,073
Even me.

838
01:10:55,073 --> 01:10:56,323
My father's son.

839
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:57,663
What the hell is this?

840
01:10:58,073 --> 01:10:58,783
Sorry, Bill.

841
01:10:59,203 --> 01:11:00,544
The city ordenance against
boxing...

842
01:11:01,244 --> 01:11:03,084
...is a blight. I grant you.

843
01:11:03,004 --> 01:11:04,544
I'm losing money while
you speak.

844
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,374
Go out there and collect
those bets.

845
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:08,254
How do I collect, if no one
won the fight?

846
01:11:08,634 --> 01:11:10,344
This counts as a no decision.

847
01:11:10,344 --> 01:11:11,384
You've got that covered,
right?

848
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:13,214
Didn't anyone pay off the
god damn police?

849
01:11:13,214 --> 01:11:14,804
Yes, the municipal police...

850
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,014
...this is the metropolitan
police.

851
01:11:16,014 --> 01:11:17,554
You're going to repay me
every cent.

852
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:18,554
Wait! Mr. Tweed!

853
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:19,554
Who asked for your opinion?

854
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:20,354
Let him speak!

855
01:11:20,934 --> 01:11:22,274
We don't answer to you.

856
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:25,314
The law says there's no
boxing in the city, right?

857
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,394
That's right, in the city.

858
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:27,984
Where does the city end?

859
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:39,165
The winner...in the
75th round...

860
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:43,955
Allow me to acknowledge the
man who's vision..

861
01:11:43,955 --> 01:11:47,425
...and enterprise, made possible
the staging of this noble combat...

862
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:54,675
...in this inspiring and entirely
legal surroundings, Mr. William Cutting!

863
01:11:57,765 --> 01:12:01,895
And his young associate.

864
01:12:10,736 --> 01:12:13,026
Well done. You're a
quick learner.

865
01:12:13,446 --> 01:12:14,156
We done good.

866
01:12:14,576 --> 01:12:15,286
We done well.

867
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:17,996
May I have your kind
attention?

868
01:12:18,456 --> 01:12:24,046
May I remind you of the wonders
of my museum on Broadway...

869
01:12:25,046 --> 01:12:28,926
...P.T.Barnum's gallery of
wonders!

870
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,806
It's a funny feeling
being taken...

871
01:12:39,806 --> 01:12:41,056
...under the wing of a dragon.

872
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,357
It's warmer than you think.

873
01:12:45,477 --> 01:12:48,067
That's the building of our
country right there, Mr. Cutting.

874
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:49,947
Americans are borning.

875
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:54,077
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

876
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,537
Irish, who do jobs for a nickel...

877
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:57,997
...that niggers do for a dime...

878
01:12:57,997 --> 01:13:00,327
...and a white man used to
get a quarter for.

879
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:03,077
What have they done? Name one
thing they've contributed!

880
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:03,327
Votes!

881
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:04,787
Votes, you say?

882
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,547
They vote on who the
Archbishop tells them...

883
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:08,667
...and who tells him?

884
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,257
Their king in the pointy hat,
who sits on his throne in Rome.

885
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:15,968
He's got mixed feelings with
regards to the Irish.

886
01:13:15,968 --> 01:13:21,228
Bill, deliver these good and
fervant folk to the polls.

887
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:25,228
And there will be a handsome price
for each vote that goes Tammany's way.

888
01:13:28,688 --> 01:13:30,438
Miy father gave his life...

889
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:32,318
...making this country
what it is.

890
01:13:32,318 --> 01:13:37,658
Murdered by the British, with all
of his men, July 25 juli, 1814.

891
01:13:37,658 --> 01:13:41,458
You think I'm going to help
you, befoul his legacy?

892
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,418
By giving this country to them...

893
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:44,878
...who's had no hand in
fighting for it.

894
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,998
Why? Because they come off the
boat crawling with lice...

895
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:48,338
...and begging you for soup?

896
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:52,129
You're a great one for the
fighting Bill, I know...

897
01:13:52,129 --> 01:13:53,889
...but you can't fight
forever.

898
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,009
I can go down doing it .

899
01:13:55,009 --> 01:13:56,049
And you will.

900
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:01,889
What did you say?

901
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:05,149
I said, you're turning you
back on the future.

902
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,439
Not our future.

903
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,489
That document makes you
a citizen...

904
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:19,619
...this one makes you a
private in the Union army.

905
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,159
Now go fight for your country.

906
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:22,459
Next.

907
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,170
Sign here, son.

908
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:26,580
Or make your mark.

909
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,770
Here's your musket. Make sure
you keep it dry on the boat.

910
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,650
Where  are we going?

911
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:51,650
I heard Tennessee.

912
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,171
Do they feed us now, you think?

913
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:21,721
My children, my chidren.

914
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:26,311
We must heal the divisions between us!

915
01:15:27,271 --> 01:15:33,862
This war must cease. North and
South must stand united.

916
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:44,792
What happens at the finish?

917
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:47,502
Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!

918
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,292
Ain't you never been to a theatre before?

919
01:15:51,462 --> 01:15:52,092
No.

920
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,012
Mr Legree, lay down your whip.

921
01:15:56,922 --> 01:16:00,552
Miss Elisa join hands with mr. Shelby.

922
01:16:00,552 --> 01:16:04,352
And Topsy. Dear little Topsy.

923
01:16:04,722 --> 01:16:07,193
Cradle Uncle Tom's head.

924
01:16:07,733 --> 01:16:09,523
Leave the nigger dead.

925
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,373
Down with the Union!

926
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,163
Down with the Union!

927
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:49,814
For the blood of the Irish.

928
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:51,774
Bill, get down!

929
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:02,074
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

930
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,205
Who's man are you?

931
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,085
Speak smart and speak up!

932
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,376
What's he saying?

933
01:17:52,086 --> 01:17:54,676
I think he's making his peace with God.

934
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:55,756
To hell with that!

935
01:17:56,216 --> 01:17:57,466
He makes his peace with me.

936
01:17:57,466 --> 01:18:01,056
I'm hearing your confession tonight,
you Irish whore!

937
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,186
Who's man are you?

938
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:04,056
We speak English in this country.

939
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:04,896
Who's man are you?

940
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:06,436
Do you see this knife, I'm
gonna teach...

941
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:08,976
...you to speak English with
this knife!

942
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,146
Who's man are you?

943
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:12,446
Who's man are you?

944
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:30,377
Well that didn't tell us very much.

945
01:18:34,257 --> 01:18:35,677
Fine waist coat.

946
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:39,137
Shame, I don't think it can be mended!

947
01:18:41,057 --> 01:18:43,307
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

948
01:19:17,798 --> 01:19:19,758
Where's Legree? Where's Topsy?

949
01:19:20,678 --> 01:19:24,558
Jezus, let's continue.
Intermission is over.

950
01:19:42,789 --> 01:19:44,749
Now that was bloody Shakespearian.

951
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:46,459
What?

952
01:19:46,459 --> 01:19:47,919
Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?

953
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,709
He was the fellow who wrote the
King James' Bible.

954
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:54,669
Mr., I don't know what you are
talking about.

955
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:57,219
Because you're an ignorant
Irish welp!

956
01:19:58,299 --> 01:19:59,389
Just like your father.

957
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:07,100
That's it. Tear my head off and
destruct the world.

958
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,770
Just like the other stupid Irish
in this country.

959
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,610
That's why I never ran with your dad.

960
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,610
Get off me you crazy bastard!

961
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,320
It means if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

962
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,740
I don't know if your being too clever
or too dumb.

963
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,000
But whatever it is, remember
this much.

964
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:31,290
For all his faults, your father was
a man who loved his people.

965
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:43,681
Amsterdam. Amsterdam. New York is
calling you.

966
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:59,111
Look at that. What in Christ's
name is that?

967
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:04,531
Rythms of the  dark continent,
thrown into the kettle...

968
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:10,961
...with an Irish shindig. Stir it around a few times.
Poured out as a fine American mess.

969
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,252
A jig, doing a jig!

970
01:21:15,552 --> 01:21:16,752
A little keep sake.

971
01:21:20,802 --> 01:21:21,682
Good on ya, sir.

972
01:21:21,682 --> 01:21:23,092
Come upstairs with me Bill.

973
01:21:24,932 --> 01:21:26,062
Have I ever had you before?

974
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:31,022
So you don't call me by my
christian name.

975
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:35,232
Bill. My god you're alright!

976
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,322
I heard the news and came over
as quick as I could.

977
01:21:37,732 --> 01:21:39,862
As timely as the angel of death.

978
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:44,872
You're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what your suggesting?

979
01:21:44,872 --> 01:21:46,743
Stop slabbering. If I thought
it was you...

980
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:48,293
...you'd be in a wooden coat.

981
01:21:48,793 --> 01:21:50,413
I've got a hole in my shoulder
and it hurts...

982
01:21:50,413 --> 01:21:52,003
...so have a drink and shut up.

983
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:53,503
Or shut up and get out.

984
01:21:55,173 --> 01:21:56,503
I believe I'll have a drink.

985
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:59,423
Carefull, Tweedy the morts
are frenchified!

986
01:22:00,843 --> 01:22:01,973
No, I'm clean.

987
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:16,983
Jenny.

988
01:22:16,983 --> 01:22:17,613
Bill.

989
01:22:36,794 --> 01:22:37,504
I'll wrap you up.

990
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:43,344
It's gotta be tight.

991
01:22:44,724 --> 01:22:45,974
Loves to make me cry.

992
01:22:47,554 --> 01:22:48,474
You can take it!

993
01:22:58,275 --> 01:22:59,575
There's my boy.

994
01:23:06,285 --> 01:23:07,115
It's alright.

995
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:14,715
To the Butcher!

996
01:23:19,965 --> 01:23:21,505
We're all much obliged.

997
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:24,975
Forever.

998
01:23:25,515 --> 01:23:28,225
To the Butcher!

999
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,736
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

1000
01:23:42,616 --> 01:23:43,406
Go on. Go!

1001
01:24:01,386 --> 01:24:03,257
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

1002
01:24:03,637 --> 01:24:04,017
Yes!

1003
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:05,017
You!

1004
01:24:16,647 --> 01:24:17,607
Belt down!

1005
01:24:29,997 --> 01:24:31,127
Try it and I'll bite ya.

1006
01:24:32,377 --> 01:24:33,497
You were gonna bite me.

1007
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:35,667
I dont think you want me.

1008
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,757
Find out.

1009
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:10,788
Oh, Jenny!

1010
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,790
I can't sleep.

1011
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,560
I hope you don't mind us
laying here, sir?

1012
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,810
Whatever takes your fancy,
young friend.

1013
01:26:22,201 --> 01:26:23,781
Is your shoulder keeping you up?

1014
01:26:24,611 --> 01:26:26,491
I don't sleep too much.

1015
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:30,541
I sleep with one eye open. I only
got one eye.

1016
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,421
How old are you Amsterdam?

1017
01:26:44,381 --> 01:26:48,221
Not too sure. Never did
figure it.

1018
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:51,931
I'm 47.

1019
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,482
47 years old.

1020
01:27:00,192 --> 01:27:03,692
You know how I stayed alive
this long? All these years.

1021
01:27:06,492 --> 01:27:07,322
Fear!

1022
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:12,292
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

1023
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:17,212
Somebody steals from me, I cut
off his hands.

1024
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:20,132
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.

1025
01:27:20,752 --> 01:27:25,132
He rises against me, I cut off his
head, stick it on a pike!

1026
01:27:26,382 --> 01:27:29,473
Raise it high up, so all in the
streets can see.

1027
01:27:31,683 --> 01:27:33,773
That's what preserves the order
of things.

1028
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:39,233
Fear.

1029
01:27:42,943 --> 01:27:45,953
That one tonight. Who was he?

1030
01:27:48,533 --> 01:27:52,333
A nobody. A coward.

1031
01:27:55,253 --> 01:27:58,293
What an end that
would have been.

1032
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:03,674
I killed the last honourable man
15 years ago.

1033
01:28:05,464 --> 01:28:06,474
Since then....

1034
01:28:09,804 --> 01:28:11,304
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

1035
01:28:16,274 --> 01:28:17,944
Has your mouth been glued up with juice?

1036
01:28:17,944 --> 01:28:19,314
I asked you a question!

1037
01:28:19,314 --> 01:28:20,814
I said I've seen it, sir.

1038
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:29,914
You got a murderous rage in you.
I like it.

1039
01:28:30,494 --> 01:28:33,624
So much life boiling up in you.
That's good!

1040
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:41,425
The priest and me lived by the
same principles.

1041
01:28:44,755 --> 01:28:46,885
Only faith divided us.

1042
01:28:50,385 --> 01:28:51,895
He gave me this you know?

1043
01:28:57,935 --> 01:29:00,235
That was the finest beating I
ever took.

1044
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:06,485
My face was pulp. My guts pierced.
My ribs all messed up.

1045
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:13,536
When he came to finish me...

1046
01:29:18,756 --> 01:29:20,376
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

1047
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:29,056
He spared me because...

1048
01:29:30,636 --> 01:29:32,516
....he wanted me to live in shame.

1049
01:29:32,516 --> 01:29:33,936
This was a great man.

1050
01:29:37,526 --> 01:29:38,606
A great man.

1051
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,777
So I cut out the eye that
looked away.

1052
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:50,707
Sent it to him wrapped in
blue paper.

1053
01:29:52,207 --> 01:29:54,747
I would've cut them both out if I
could afford being blind.

1054
01:29:57,667 --> 01:29:59,757
I rose up again with a full heart...

1055
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,877
...and buried him in his own blood.

1056
01:30:12,937 --> 01:30:13,597
Well done!

1057
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:20,278
He was the only man I killed
worth remembering.

1058
01:30:32,998 --> 01:30:34,498
I never had a son.

1059
01:30:43,758 --> 01:30:45,718
Civilisation is crumbling.

1060
01:31:04,989 --> 01:31:06,069
God bless you!

1061
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,540
If you've got anything to say...

1062
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,920
...now is the time to say it.

1063
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:45,670
Who is he to you, Jenny?

1064
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:54,270
I was 12 years old.

1065
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,230
My mother was dead. I was living
in a doorway.

1066
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:08,031
He took me in. Took care of me in
his own way.

1067
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:15,701
After they cut out the baby...

1068
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:22,001
He doesn't fancy girls that
scarred up.

1069
01:32:29,761 --> 01:32:33,141
You should know, in your own mind...

1070
01:32:35,511 --> 01:32:38,522
...that he never laid a hand on me
till I asked him too.

1071
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:03,292
Who are you?

1072
01:33:05,172 --> 01:33:06,592
Who are you?

1073
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:31,635
Gentlemen, you are most welcome to
this palace of enchantment...

1074
01:34:32,135 --> 01:34:40,395
...with visions to rival the tales of
Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!

1075
01:35:04,626 --> 01:35:06,676
Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!

1076
01:35:07,256 --> 01:35:09,846
Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...

1077
01:35:11,006 --> 01:35:12,346
...of these creatures.

1078
01:35:13,056 --> 01:35:16,266
Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!

1079
01:35:16,936 --> 01:35:19,556
How would you like to make them sing?

1080
01:35:20,146 --> 01:35:25,236
They could be singing for you.

1081
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:36,037
May God put the spirit of the
holy steel in my spine...

1082
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:40,247
...and the love of the blessed
Virgin in my heart.

1083
01:35:43,707 --> 01:35:44,587
Amen.

1084
01:35:49,427 --> 01:35:52,557
Easy now. What did you say?

1085
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:55,177
He's not who he says he is.

1086
01:35:57,057 --> 01:35:58,597
He's not who he says he is?

1087
01:36:03,478 --> 01:36:05,688
Count you blessings he considers
you a friend!

1088
01:36:07,898 --> 01:36:12,068
The only thing he considers every day
and night is how to kill you!

1089
01:36:14,948 --> 01:36:17,538
Those eyes want me to take
them out for you!

1090
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,458
I'll bury it up you fundunem where
it belongs!

1091
01:36:22,168 --> 01:36:24,498
I can read right through them!
They're empty...

1092
01:36:24,498 --> 01:36:25,548
His name is Vallon.

1093
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:29,468
Don't do it Bill!

1094
01:36:30,048 --> 01:36:31,088
His name is Vallon!

1095
01:37:03,999 --> 01:37:05,999
Curious people these celestials.

1096
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:09,759
You know why they use short
sleeves?

1097
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,340
So everyone can see he's got
nothing stashed.

1098
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,930
I hope it doesn't become a fashion.

1099
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:22,940
Johnny?

1100
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:02,231
Get up!

1101
01:38:18,282 --> 01:38:23,332
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have
your kind attention.

1102
01:38:23,332 --> 01:38:25,752
As some of you have surely
noticed...

1103
01:38:26,212 --> 01:38:29,882
...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting...

1104
01:38:30,302 --> 01:38:36,182
..is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction!

1105
01:38:41,022 --> 01:38:44,562
May we appeal to him, to favour us...

1106
01:38:44,562 --> 01:38:46,982
...with another exciting exhibition.

1107
01:38:47,482 --> 01:38:53,653
Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!

1108
01:39:13,763 --> 01:39:14,633
What's gonna happen?

1109
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:44,584
The spider's kiss!

1110
01:39:48,214 --> 01:39:49,174
The wheel of death!

1111
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:50,884
William Tell!

1112
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,964
The butterfly!

1113
01:39:53,384 --> 01:39:54,304
The spider's kiss!

1114
01:39:54,884 --> 01:39:56,424
The Butcher's apprentice!

1115
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:58,304
The Butcher's apprentice!

1116
01:39:58,554 --> 01:40:00,805
A command performance!

1117
01:40:03,065 --> 01:40:03,975
Where have you been?

1118
01:40:04,355 --> 01:40:06,605
A command performance indeed.

1119
01:40:07,105 --> 01:40:08,065
I want you to get out of here!

1120
01:40:08,645 --> 01:40:11,775
And for this, I must beg the
indulgence...

1121
01:40:11,775 --> 01:40:12,695
...of my former...

1122
01:40:12,695 --> 01:40:14,985
... assistent in matters of impailment...

1123
01:40:16,245 --> 01:40:18,535
...the Butcher's original apprentice.

1124
01:40:20,535 --> 01:40:21,745
What do you say, Jen?

1125
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:24,375
One more time for the
sweet souvenir.

1126
01:40:25,795 --> 01:40:26,255
Come on!

1127
01:40:36,846 --> 01:40:38,266
Don't do it!

1128
01:40:50,776 --> 01:40:51,856
She'll be alright.

1129
01:40:55,656 --> 01:40:56,536
Remember this?

1130
01:40:56,696 --> 01:40:57,156
Of course!

1131
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:11,377
You may feel more comfortable without
that garment, Miss Everdeane!

1132
01:41:13,677 --> 01:41:15,677
You'll have to filch me a
new one, Bill!

1133
01:41:30,147 --> 01:41:32,107
Anything in your pockets tonight?

1134
01:41:32,857 --> 01:41:34,737
I ain't started working yet.

1135
01:41:38,327 --> 01:41:40,497
What about that locket I
gave you?

1136
01:41:56,548 --> 01:41:58,888
Apologies my dear. Pick it up.

1137
01:42:04,648 --> 01:42:06,108
Whoopsie daisy!

1138
01:42:08,688 --> 01:42:10,228
Now its good and broke!

1139
01:42:11,898 --> 01:42:13,988
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

1140
01:42:22,249 --> 01:42:25,119
You got the sand to give 'm a
grand finale?

1141
01:42:34,379 --> 01:42:36,549
Maybe when you're aiming a
little straighter.

1142
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:49,019
Enough of this heathen music.

1143
01:42:49,979 --> 01:42:51,940
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.

1144
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:53,070
Strike up boys!

1145
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,410
This is a night for Americans!

1146
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:06,460
Jenny!

1147
01:44:03,392 --> 01:44:04,352
Hats off!

1148
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:15,742
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

1149
01:44:16,942 --> 01:44:19,322
...whose blood stains the very streets...

1150
01:44:19,322 --> 01:44:20,622
...we walk today.

1151
01:44:22,242 --> 01:44:27,462
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies.

1152
01:44:29,622 --> 01:44:31,332
An honourable man...

1153
01:44:32,382 --> 01:44:36,343
...who crossed over bravely.
Fighting for what he believed in.

1154
01:44:43,723 --> 01:44:47,483
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish
his life...

1155
01:44:48,433 --> 01:44:51,103
... and consume him as I consume
these flames.

1156
01:44:53,733 --> 01:44:55,613
In honour of Priest Vallon.

1157
01:44:58,073 --> 01:44:59,033
In honour of Priest Vallon!

1158
01:45:04,533 --> 01:45:06,043
That's a wound !

1159
01:45:15,804 --> 01:45:19,424
I want you all to meet the son of
Priest Vallon.

1160
01:45:20,634 --> 01:45:22,344
I took him under my wing...

1161
01:45:23,474 --> 01:45:25,054
...and see how I'm repaid.

1162
01:45:25,764 --> 01:45:28,644
He saved my life one day so he
could kill me the next...

1163
01:45:28,644 --> 01:45:30,104
...like a sneak thief.

1164
01:45:30,564 --> 01:45:32,104
Instead of fighting like a man.

1165
01:45:33,944 --> 01:45:37,864
A base defiler. Unworthy of
a noble name.

1166
01:45:51,415 --> 01:45:53,335
That'll do Mcgloin.
Spread him out.

1167
01:45:55,755 --> 01:45:59,135
I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.

1168
01:46:05,855 --> 01:46:07,395
This is fresh meat!

1169
01:46:09,935 --> 01:46:11,985
We need to tenderise this meat
a bit.

1170
01:46:13,445 --> 01:46:16,616
Alright, lets kiss goodnight to
that pretty face of yours!

1171
01:46:27,536 --> 01:46:28,536
No...!

1172
01:46:30,836 --> 01:46:35,006
What'll it be then. Rib or chop.
Loin or shank.

1173
01:46:35,006 --> 01:46:35,466
The liver!

1174
01:46:35,466 --> 01:46:35,966
The spleen!

1175
01:46:37,296 --> 01:46:37,846
The kidney!

1176
01:46:44,976 --> 01:46:45,476
The lung!

1177
01:46:45,806 --> 01:46:46,346
The liver!

1178
01:46:47,266 --> 01:46:47,726
The tongue!

1179
01:46:50,227 --> 01:46:51,607
The heart! The heart!

1180
01:46:51,607 --> 01:46:52,777
The heart?

1181
01:46:53,107 --> 01:46:54,697
This boy has no heart.

1182
01:46:54,697 --> 01:46:57,157
Then kill him!

1183
01:47:02,617 --> 01:47:04,287
He ain't earned the death!

1184
01:47:04,707 --> 01:47:07,037
He ain't earned the death of
my hands!

1185
01:47:09,037 --> 01:47:11,997
He'll walk amongst you marked
with shame.

1186
01:47:11,997 --> 01:47:16,717
A freak. Worthy of Barnum's
museum of wonders.

1187
01:47:17,757 --> 01:47:21,427
God's only man, speared by
the Butcher.

1188
01:48:00,759 --> 01:48:03,759
Here. Here. This way.

1189
01:48:03,759 --> 01:48:04,599
Come on.

1190
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,110
I want to show you something.

1191
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,780
My mother's bones share this
grave.

1192
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,871
I've saved 20 cents out of every
dollar I've ever earned since ....

1193
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:07,911
...I was thirteen.

1194
01:49:10,791 --> 01:49:12,501
That's 215 dollars.

1195
01:49:13,671 --> 01:49:15,341
For bludgeoning and the rest.

1196
01:49:20,261 --> 01:49:22,641
This is what I wanted to show you.

1197
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,311
This is where we're going to go,
as soon as you get better....

1198
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:31,351
...San Fransisco, California.

1199
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:35,941
You can have anything you want
out there.

1200
01:49:37,691 --> 01:49:40,862
These men are pulling gold right
out of the river.

1201
01:49:41,362 --> 01:49:42,532
With their own hands.

1202
01:49:44,912 --> 01:49:48,492
We're here and need to get there.

1203
01:49:50,452 --> 01:49:51,542
Start here.

1204
01:49:52,622 --> 01:49:55,252
Go down 'round here.

1205
01:49:58,132 --> 01:49:59,422
Up to San Francisco.

1206
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,512
The shortest way to go.

1207
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:06,472
Will you go with me?

1208
01:50:32,163 --> 01:50:34,833
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

1209
01:50:36,503 --> 01:50:38,793
An audience with yor mangled
friend is all I want.

1210
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:57,404
I've 44 notches on my club.

1211
01:50:59,614 --> 01:51:00,864
Do you know what they are for?

1212
01:51:03,824 --> 01:51:05,614
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

1213
01:51:13,704 --> 01:51:15,504
My father was killed in battle too.

1214
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:19,004
In Ireland, in the streets.

1215
01:51:21,965 --> 01:51:23,885
Fighting those who were taking
their privilege.

1216
01:51:24,765 --> 01:51:26,305
What only could be got and held...

1217
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:28,095
...by the decimation of a race.

1218
01:51:29,805 --> 01:51:32,015
That war is a thousand years old
and more.

1219
01:51:33,985 --> 01:51:35,735
We never expected it to follow
us here.

1220
01:51:38,695 --> 01:51:39,315
It didn't.

1221
01:51:40,825 --> 01:51:42,325
It was waiting for us when
we landed.

1222
01:51:47,155 --> 01:51:50,415
Your father tried to carve out a
corner in this country for his tribe.

1223
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:55,005
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.

1224
01:51:59,216 --> 01:52:01,466
I often wondered, if he'd lived a
bit longer...

1225
01:52:03,596 --> 01:52:05,306
...would he have wanted it to
be more.

1226
01:52:17,566 --> 01:52:19,736
Why did you rifle through his
pockets then?

1227
01:52:38,007 --> 01:52:39,257
For safekeeping.

1228
01:52:43,387 --> 01:52:44,677
I thought maybe you could do
with it.

1229
01:53:07,748 --> 01:53:09,408
Blood stays on the blade.

1230
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:28,830
That's a sorry looking pelt.

1231
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:37,080
And it's been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

1232
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,010
Tell me, this charge. Does it sit
on easy with you?

1233
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:49,391
No. Not uneasy , Bill.

1234
01:54:51,061 --> 01:54:52,681
I wouldn't say that.

1235
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:59,861
But... my allegiance is
to the law.

1236
01:55:01,861 --> 01:55:03,861
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1237
01:55:20,342 --> 01:55:22,712
What in heaven's name are you
talking about?

1238
01:55:28,052 --> 01:55:32,472
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing
that, Jack. That way lies damnation.

1239
01:55:36,812 --> 01:55:38,652
I'm in no danger of
damnation, Bill.

1240
01:55:51,032 --> 01:55:52,202
Here's the thing.

1241
01:55:54,503 --> 01:55:57,713
I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...

1242
01:55:57,713 --> 01:55:59,173
..you meatheaded shit sack.

1243
01:56:01,793 --> 01:56:03,343
That's more or less the thing.

1244
01:56:05,883 --> 01:56:08,593
I want you to go out there. You
and nobody else.

1245
01:56:09,303 --> 01:56:10,433
None of your little minions.

1246
01:56:10,433 --> 01:56:12,053
I want you to go out there...

1247
01:56:13,813 --> 01:56:15,023
...and I want you...

1248
01:56:16,813 --> 01:56:20,193
...to punish, the person...

1249
01:56:20,903 --> 01:56:22,693
...who's responsible...

1250
01:56:25,653 --> 01:56:29,284
...for murdering this poor
little rabbit.

1251
01:56:36,254 --> 01:56:37,504
Is that understood?

1252
01:56:42,254 --> 01:56:43,004
Right!

1253
01:56:45,304 --> 01:56:48,014
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

1254
01:57:26,055 --> 01:57:26,555
Damn it!

1255
01:57:29,425 --> 01:57:30,555
Is that you, boy?

1256
01:57:32,845 --> 01:57:35,055
I didn't mean nothing by that shot
you know?

1257
01:57:36,686 --> 01:57:38,066
You scared me is all.

1258
01:57:41,566 --> 01:57:43,736
You know I'd never do you harm.

1259
01:57:45,316 --> 01:57:46,696
Come out now, lad.

1260
01:57:49,946 --> 01:57:51,656
Remember your father and me?

1261
01:57:55,786 --> 01:57:58,546
Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?

1262
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:02,966
The times we had.

1263
01:58:09,676 --> 01:58:11,057
You know I won't hurt you.

1264
01:58:44,257 --> 01:58:45,508
This is bad for everybody.

1265
01:58:45,508 --> 01:58:47,258
What's next, dead politicians?

1266
01:58:49,598 --> 01:58:51,768
I could spare half a dozen
of you...

1267
01:58:52,428 --> 01:58:53,848
...easier than I can spare him.

1268
01:58:55,518 --> 01:58:58,518
Still, I think it shows dash.

1269
01:58:59,518 --> 01:59:02,398
Give the boy some time, we'll
settle with a good dust up.

1270
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:35,939
The lads!

1271
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:49,659
There are more of us coming off
the ships each day.

1272
01:59:50,909 --> 01:59:53,040
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1273
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:57,250
And we're afraid of the Natives!

1274
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:01,290
Get all of us together...

1275
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:02,630
....we ain't got a gang..

1276
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:04,050
...we got an army.

1277
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:09,010
And all we need is a spark. One
spark, to wake us all up.

1278
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:28,401
It was me who played you false.

1279
02:00:31,161 --> 02:00:32,531
I'd take it back if I could.

1280
02:00:32,531 --> 02:00:33,741
Take it back?

1281
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:39,831
Johnny, I ought to kill you!

1282
02:00:54,721 --> 02:00:56,851
Get out of the Points and
don't come back.

1283
02:01:05,612 --> 02:01:06,652
Where are you going, boil?

1284
02:01:08,902 --> 02:01:09,572
Come along.

1285
02:01:10,702 --> 02:01:11,282
Come on.

1286
02:01:14,832 --> 02:01:16,622
Tell us John, what's the trouble?

1287
02:01:18,662 --> 02:01:19,832
No trouble, Bill.

1288
02:01:23,422 --> 02:01:25,092
Still hiding out with
your friends?

1289
02:01:29,092 --> 02:01:32,762
No, I'm not with them, Bill.

1290
02:01:34,012 --> 02:01:36,353
I'm with you, with the Natives.

1291
02:01:41,643 --> 02:01:44,903
You always were a Native, as far
as I'm interested, John.

1292
02:01:48,073 --> 02:01:49,993
Till you became a stag.

1293
02:01:54,663 --> 02:01:56,373
You tell me you're a Native?

1294
02:01:56,373 --> 02:01:57,663
Do you want to know what
a Native is?

1295
02:02:00,293 --> 02:02:05,753
A Native is a man, who's
willing to give his life...

1296
02:02:06,843 --> 02:02:08,213
...for his country.

1297
02:02:10,384 --> 02:02:12,134
Like my father done.

1298
02:02:15,934 --> 02:02:18,564
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

1299
02:02:28,654 --> 02:02:30,324
John? Johnny?

1300
02:02:39,544 --> 02:02:40,204
Johnny?

1301
02:02:50,675 --> 02:02:51,385
I'll get you off.

1302
02:03:05,315 --> 02:03:06,815
It hurts too much.

1303
02:03:14,115 --> 02:03:15,155
Just kill me.

1304
02:03:20,876 --> 02:03:22,166
Just kill me.

1305
02:03:24,836 --> 02:03:26,836
Please. Please.

1306
02:03:33,716 --> 02:03:36,056
Please. Please.

1307
02:03:40,106 --> 02:03:40,726
Please.

1308
02:03:46,236 --> 02:03:47,406
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1309
02:04:04,587 --> 02:04:06,717
Oh, Mary mother of God, pray
for us sinners...

1310
02:04:06,717 --> 02:04:08,677
...on the day of our death...amen.

1311
02:04:10,797 --> 02:04:12,137
Rest in peace, Ma.

1312
02:04:15,807 --> 02:04:16,977
What are you doing here, boil?

1313
02:04:24,687 --> 02:04:26,858
What's that nigger doing in
this church?

1314
02:04:32,198 --> 02:04:34,328
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with
the Natives,huh?

1315
02:04:34,328 --> 02:04:35,998
No niggers among the Natives.

1316
02:04:35,998 --> 02:04:37,498
Niggers as robbers is
one thing...

1317
02:04:37,498 --> 02:04:39,958
...but niggers in a church,
that's something else!

1318
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:42,078
You run with the Natives, you go
pray with the Natives!

1319
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:44,628
You're going to wind up on a stake
like your man did!

1320
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:46,048
McGloin?

1321
02:04:47,378 --> 02:04:50,758
Father! Jezus, do you know there's
a nigger in your church?

1322
02:05:09,859 --> 02:05:11,069
Jezus!

1323
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:36,060
The earth turns...

1324
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:39,810
...but we don't feel it move.

1325
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,110
And one night you look up...

1326
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:51,820
...one spark and the skie's on fire.

1327
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:05,590
It's a touching spectacle.

1328
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:10,511
We'll come back when you're
ready for us.

1329
02:06:17,891 --> 02:06:20,311
The past is the torch that
lights our way.

1330
02:06:21,891 --> 02:06:23,811
Where our fathers have shown
us the path.

1331
02:06:24,981 --> 02:06:26,231
We shall follow.

1332
02:06:29,111 --> 02:06:32,281
Our faith is the weapon most
feared by our enemies...

1333
02:06:33,491 --> 02:06:35,621
...for thereby shall we lift our
people up...

1334
02:06:35,621 --> 02:06:37,701
...against those who will
destroy us.

1335
02:06:38,741 --> 02:06:43,122
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits,
to remind all of our suffering...

1336
02:06:43,792 --> 02:06:46,132
...and as a call to those who
suffer still...

1337
02:06:46,132 --> 02:06:47,542
...to join our ranks.

1338
02:06:48,002 --> 02:06:52,762
However so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

1339
02:06:52,762 --> 02:06:56,762
For with great numbers, must come
great strength.

1340
02:06:57,602 --> 02:06:59,392
For the salvation of our people.

1341
02:07:01,222 --> 02:07:02,142
We don't want your business.

1342
02:07:02,142 --> 02:07:02,982
How many other men live here?

1343
02:07:03,432 --> 02:07:04,312
You all have to register.

1344
02:07:04,312 --> 02:07:06,102
You can't force me to join
no army.

1345
02:07:06,482 --> 02:07:07,362
Have you got 300 dollars?

1346
02:07:07,362 --> 02:07:07,902
Of course not!

1347
02:07:07,902 --> 02:07:09,322
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

1348
02:07:09,322 --> 02:07:12,322
If you are drafted, release from militairy
service can only be secured...

1349
02:07:12,692 --> 02:07:15,202
...for 300 dollars, according to
the conscription act.

1350
02:07:15,202 --> 02:07:15,783
300 Dollars?

1351
02:07:15,783 --> 02:07:17,033
Otherwise you have to serve!

1352
02:07:17,033 --> 02:07:18,493
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

1353
02:07:18,493 --> 02:07:19,243
You have to serve, sir!

1354
02:07:19,243 --> 02:07:19,873
You tell me!

1355
02:07:21,793 --> 02:07:22,373
Boys!

1356
02:07:24,503 --> 02:07:26,753
I was born here, sir. You
immigrated here!

1357
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:31,133
Sweet jezus. War does terrible
things to men.

1358
02:07:31,803 --> 02:07:33,383
Get back up town, where you
belong!

1359
02:07:33,383 --> 02:07:36,183
300 dollars. It's another rich
man's war!

1360
02:07:38,013 --> 02:07:40,053
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

1361
02:07:42,773 --> 02:07:44,563
Don't they speak English in
New York anymore!

1362
02:07:45,063 --> 02:07:46,273
Don't understand.

1363
02:07:46,273 --> 02:07:47,313
You do speak English!

1364
02:07:49,113 --> 02:07:53,614
I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle
her rifle in another direction?

1365
02:07:58,824 --> 02:08:02,624
I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the value of this sort of publicity?

1366
02:08:05,754 --> 02:08:09,964
The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder
with half the Irish in the Five Points.

1367
02:08:12,044 --> 02:08:14,554
I'm offering my boy, to form an
alliance with you...

1368
02:08:14,554 --> 02:08:17,264
...against Bill Cutting and his
slate of Native candidates.

1369
02:08:18,264 --> 02:08:21,104
I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for
every Irish vote...

1370
02:08:21,104 --> 02:08:23,685
...you send Tammany's way, in the
coming elections.

1371
02:08:26,235 --> 02:08:28,235
I need a new friend in the Five
Points, son.

1372
02:08:32,575 --> 02:08:33,945
I'd like that friend to
be you.

1373
02:08:38,285 --> 02:08:39,995
Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1374
02:08:41,035 --> 02:08:42,955
Suppose we do get you those votes.

1375
02:08:46,545 --> 02:08:49,005
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my chosing..

1376
02:08:49,005 --> 02:08:49,715
I don't think so.

1377
02:08:49,715 --> 02:08:51,385
What if we get you all the
Irish votes?

1378
02:08:51,385 --> 02:08:55,005
Mr. Vallon, that will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick!

1379
02:08:57,976 --> 02:08:58,806
Beg your pardon?

1380
02:08:58,806 --> 02:09:00,136
That means it will never happen.

1381
02:09:00,136 --> 02:09:02,856
Now I might be persuaded to back
an Irish candidate...

1382
02:09:02,856 --> 02:09:03,976
...for, let's say alderman.

1383
02:09:03,976 --> 02:09:04,356
Alderman?

1384
02:09:04,816 --> 02:09:06,816
We've already got an Irish
alderman.

1385
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:07,736
So we have, that's why....

1386
02:09:07,736 --> 02:09:09,106
What's bigger than an alderman?

1387
02:09:11,816 --> 02:09:12,526
Sheriff!

1388
02:09:13,446 --> 02:09:14,196
Sheriff!

1389
02:09:14,526 --> 02:09:17,696
Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an
Irishman for sheriff...

1390
02:09:17,696 --> 02:09:19,496
...of the city and county of
New York...

1391
02:09:19,496 --> 02:09:21,496
...and we'll get him elected.

1392
02:09:21,496 --> 02:09:22,666
I love the Irish, son...

1393
02:09:22,666 --> 02:09:24,916
..but higher than alderman you
shall never climb.

1394
02:09:24,916 --> 02:09:25,706
Why not?

1395
02:09:26,336 --> 02:09:29,166
For one thing, no man living can
consolidate the Irish vote.

1396
02:09:29,166 --> 02:09:29,626
I can!

1397
02:09:29,626 --> 02:09:31,256
And for another, I mean no
offence...

1398
02:09:31,927 --> 02:09:33,427
...no one's yet found an Irish
candidate...

1399
02:09:33,427 --> 02:09:34,967
...for sheriff worth voting for.

1400
02:09:38,637 --> 02:09:39,137
Monk!

1401
02:09:40,937 --> 02:09:41,347
Here.

1402
02:09:46,897 --> 02:09:49,317
Got me looking as sober as me own
grandfather!

1403
02:09:49,317 --> 02:09:50,697
He was a great man, I'm sure.

1404
02:09:51,147 --> 02:09:52,857
He was a drunken bastard.

1405
02:09:55,947 --> 02:09:57,117
Can I say what I want?

1406
02:09:58,867 --> 02:10:00,157
That's why I wanted you.

1407
02:10:01,407 --> 02:10:04,327
Our elected representatives are a
gang of thieves!

1408
02:10:04,327 --> 02:10:05,998
Who swear to better our lot...

1409
02:10:06,498 --> 02:10:08,378
...while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

1410
02:10:08,878 --> 02:10:13,588
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1411
02:10:13,588 --> 02:10:17,678
....against any, an all in roads in
our democracy.

1412
02:10:17,678 --> 02:10:19,428
I'll see to it, that no one
takes away...

1413
02:10:19,808 --> 02:10:21,978
... what you earned by pluck and application.

1414
02:10:21,978 --> 02:10:24,308
To invading hordes of Hibernians.

1415
02:10:24,268 --> 02:10:26,108
Go to the polls and put
your mark...

1416
02:10:26,438 --> 02:10:28,478
... next to the name Walter McGinn.

1417
02:10:28,478 --> 02:10:31,148
Against the potatoes weeders, like
them over there...

1418
02:10:31,738 --> 02:10:33,148
...thieving our jobs.

1419
02:10:33,148 --> 02:10:35,818
Why should so many Irish die down
south...

1420
02:10:35,818 --> 02:10:36,948
...when the first war to win...

1421
02:10:36,948 --> 02:10:39,078
...is not down in Dixie, but
right here...

1422
02:10:39,078 --> 02:10:40,119
...in these streets!

1423
02:10:42,829 --> 02:10:44,869
Who's the finest streetfighter in
the Five Points?

1424
02:10:45,289 --> 02:10:46,249
Monk!

1425
02:10:46,629 --> 02:10:49,549
That's right and let the whole
damn city hear it!

1426
02:10:52,009 --> 02:10:53,759
That man was right born for this.

1427
02:10:53,759 --> 02:10:56,839
He's killed 44 men and laid low a
couple of hundred more.

1428
02:10:57,089 --> 02:10:58,299
Is that right?

1429
02:10:58,299 --> 02:10:58,719
Right.

1430
02:10:59,059 --> 02:11:00,429
I should have run him for mayor!

1431
02:11:03,139 --> 02:11:04,189
Alright, line 'm up.

1432
02:11:04,689 --> 02:11:06,099
It's election day!

1433
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,740
Come on, you bastard. We need
your vote.

1434
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,030
Bastard? I fought for you
nigger...

1435
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:21,540
...I lost an arm for you!

1436
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:23,290
Well, that's a start. Come on.

1437
02:11:23,290 --> 02:11:25,160
Rise and shine, rise and shine.

1438
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:28,920
This great country of ours, even
hop fiends get their vote.

1439
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:32,090
Less heart and more haste,
darling.

1440
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:33,090
Where are you going ?

1441
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:34,510
I already voted today.

1442
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:37,050
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!

1443
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:37,930
Twice.

1444
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:38,590
Twice?

1445
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:40,850
Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty?

1446
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:41,810
Come with me.

1447
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:44,390
Oh no, you don't. Get back and
sit down.

1448
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:46,060
Here's another one!

1449
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:46,940
Clean him up good.

1450
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:49,861
Shave the beards off boys and send
them back to vote again.

1451
02:11:49,861 --> 02:11:51,691
Okay boys, vote Tammany.

1452
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:53,071
Tammany!

1453
02:11:53,071 --> 02:11:56,201
What our great city needs is a new
court house.

1454
02:11:56,201 --> 02:11:59,031
Now I propose it should be a
modest, economical structure.

1455
02:11:59,031 --> 02:12:00,121
Excuse me one moment.

1456
02:12:00,121 --> 02:12:00,531
What is it?

1457
02:12:01,081 --> 02:12:04,911
Monk's already won by 3,000 more
votes, then there are voters.

1458
02:12:04,911 --> 02:12:06,501
Only 3? Make it 20, 30.

1459
02:12:06,501 --> 02:12:08,581
We don't need a victory, we need a
Roman triumph.

1460
02:12:08,581 --> 02:12:10,541
We don't have anymore ballots.

1461
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:12,961
Remember the first rule of
politics...

1462
02:12:12,961 --> 02:12:14,461
...ballots don't make the results...

1463
02:12:14,461 --> 02:12:17,431
..the counters do. Keep counting.

1464
02:12:49,672 --> 02:12:50,672
It's from Bill.

1465
02:12:54,962 --> 02:12:55,462
Monk?

1466
02:13:16,233 --> 02:13:18,243
Citizens of the Five Points!

1467
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:22,243
Mr. Cutting is attempting to
draw me...

1468
02:13:22,243 --> 02:13:23,373
...into an argument...

1469
02:13:23,873 --> 02:13:25,493
...that would no doubt end in
bloodshed...

1470
02:13:25,493 --> 02:13:27,543
...and the compromising of my
office.

1471
02:13:29,083 --> 02:13:30,164
What do you think?

1472
02:13:31,924 --> 02:13:35,294
Shall I engage in silence, this
relic of the ancient law...

1473
02:13:35,804 --> 02:13:38,924
...or, shall I be your chosen
voice...

1474
02:13:38,924 --> 02:13:42,014
...in a new testament, in a new
world?

1475
02:13:48,224 --> 02:13:49,184
There you are, Bill.

1476
02:13:51,644 --> 02:13:52,854
The people have spoken.

1477
02:13:55,234 --> 02:13:58,154
The very notion of violent
reprisal benumbs them.

1478
02:14:01,454 --> 02:14:01,994
Come on up.

1479
02:14:03,704 --> 02:14:04,625
Let's see if we can resolve our...

1480
02:14:04,625 --> 02:14:05,995
...grievances the democratic way.

1481
02:14:30,435 --> 02:14:34,155
That my friends, is the minority
vote.

1482
02:14:36,195 --> 02:14:38,906
Now you tasted my mutton, how do
you like it?

1483
02:14:40,486 --> 02:14:43,286
Look, I want you to see this.

1484
02:14:47,336 --> 02:14:49,126
This is you, right here!

1485
02:14:49,626 --> 02:14:53,216
Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.

1486
02:15:04,886 --> 02:15:05,976
Why don't you burn him?

1487
02:15:05,976 --> 02:15:07,806
See if his ashes turn green.

1488
02:15:13,777 --> 02:15:15,737
Fortune favours them all!

1489
02:15:28,997 --> 02:15:30,537
You killed an elected official?

1490
02:15:31,667 --> 02:15:32,797
Who elected him?

1491
02:15:32,797 --> 02:15:34,467
You don't know what you've done
to yourself.

1492
02:15:41,557 --> 02:15:42,847
I know your works.

1493
02:15:44,637 --> 02:15:46,388
You're neither cold nor hot.

1494
02:15:47,018 --> 02:15:49,018
So because you are luke warm...

1495
02:15:49,018 --> 02:15:51,108
...I will spew you out of my
mouth.

1496
02:15:52,978 --> 02:15:55,568
You can build your filthy world
without me.

1497
02:15:55,568 --> 02:15:58,238
I took the father, now I'll take
the son.

1498
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:00,828
You tell young Vallon, I'm going
to paint...

1499
02:16:00,828 --> 02:16:02,658
...Paradise square with his blood.

1500
02:16:03,158 --> 02:16:04,498
Two coats!

1501
02:16:05,708 --> 02:16:08,118
I'll festoon my sleeping
chamber with his guts.

1502
02:16:08,118 --> 02:16:10,538
As for you Mr. Tammany
fucking hall...

1503
02:16:10,538 --> 02:16:12,998
...you come down to the Points
once more...

1504
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:15,918
...and you'll be dispatched by my
own hand!

1505
02:16:18,548 --> 02:16:19,758
Now get back to your
celebration...

1506
02:16:19,758 --> 02:16:21,389
...and let me eat in peace.

1507
02:16:21,389 --> 02:16:22,509
I paid you fair.

1508
02:16:47,829 --> 02:16:48,329
Down!

1509
02:16:50,329 --> 02:16:50,749
Raise!

1510
02:17:34,961 --> 02:17:35,961
You son of a bitch!

1511
02:17:41,091 --> 02:17:41,681
Challenge.

1512
02:17:44,431 --> 02:17:45,471
Challenge accepted.

1513
02:18:38,483 --> 02:18:39,653
And then it came...

1514
02:18:40,613 --> 02:18:42,243
...the first day of the draft.

1515
02:18:42,243 --> 02:18:42,993
Thomas O'neill.

1516
02:18:44,203 --> 02:18:45,033
Andrew Lewis.

1517
02:18:46,533 --> 02:18:47,583
Joseph Flynn.

1518
02:18:47,583 --> 02:18:50,953
They read out the draftees names
as if they were dead already.

1519
02:18:53,003 --> 02:18:54,333
J.B. Gleeson.

1520
02:18:55,753 --> 02:18:56,503
The O'Conell Guard.

1521
02:18:57,463 --> 02:18:58,173
The Plug Uglies.

1522
02:18:58,593 --> 02:18:58,923
As for us.

1523
02:18:58,923 --> 02:18:59,753
The Forty Thieves.

1524
02:18:59,923 --> 02:19:00,923
The tribes were gathered.

1525
02:19:02,013 --> 02:19:02,843
The Chichesters.

1526
02:19:02,843 --> 02:19:04,183
The drums were beating.

1527
02:19:04,723 --> 02:19:05,473
The Dead Rabbits.

1528
02:19:06,263 --> 02:19:07,223
The American guard.

1529
02:19:07,973 --> 02:19:08,973
The Atlantic Guard.

1530
02:19:09,313 --> 02:19:10,393
The Slaughterhouses.

1531
02:19:10,393 --> 02:19:11,684
The Bowery Boys.

1532
02:19:12,144 --> 02:19:13,944
Confederation of American Natives.

1533
02:19:15,984 --> 02:19:16,904
James Mooney.

1534
02:19:17,364 --> 02:19:18,614
But all we could see...

1535
02:19:19,404 --> 02:19:20,944
...was the hand in front of us.

1536
02:19:20,944 --> 02:19:21,824
Shaun O'Connell.

1537
02:19:23,574 --> 02:19:25,154
C.W. Morris.

1538
02:19:27,624 --> 02:19:28,164
When?

1539
02:19:28,624 --> 02:19:29,784
Whenever you like.

1540
02:19:30,204 --> 02:19:31,204
Daybreak tomorrow.

1541
02:19:31,704 --> 02:19:32,164
Ground?

1542
02:19:33,084 --> 02:19:33,704
Paradise square.

1543
02:19:35,084 --> 02:19:35,624
Weapons?

1544
02:19:36,874 --> 02:19:38,174
That I leave up to you.

1545
02:19:38,834 --> 02:19:40,714
Bricks, bats, axes, knives.

1546
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:43,264
Pistols?

1547
02:19:45,595 --> 02:19:46,595
No pistols.

1548
02:19:47,845 --> 02:19:48,895
Good boy.

1549
02:19:52,605 --> 02:19:53,685
Terms are resolved.

1550
02:19:53,685 --> 02:19:54,775
Counsel is concluded.

1551
02:20:01,945 --> 02:20:03,365
To hell with your damned draft.

1552
02:20:03,735 --> 02:20:04,905
Get 'm boys.

1553
02:20:04,905 --> 02:20:05,995
Rip 'm apart.

1554
02:20:13,795 --> 02:20:15,255
Kill the rich bastards.

1555
02:20:22,556 --> 02:20:23,466
Hotel!

1556
02:20:25,726 --> 02:20:27,516
They're not getting my son!

1557
02:20:33,146 --> 02:20:35,066
Uptown town at the draft office...

1558
02:20:35,776 --> 02:20:37,816
...the cops broke a few skulls.

1559
02:20:38,446 --> 02:20:39,986
And everybody ran away.

1560
02:20:41,816 --> 02:20:43,446
But the word was spreading...

1561
02:20:44,486 --> 02:20:45,826
...in the dark.

1562
02:20:47,536 --> 02:20:50,916
Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns
and their mob...

1563
02:20:50,916 --> 02:20:52,707
...breathed a little easy.

1564
02:20:52,707 --> 02:20:55,837
Just a brief blist of anger, over
Mr. Lincoln's draft.

1565
02:20:55,837 --> 02:20:57,667
Entirely justifiable in my view.

1566
02:20:58,167 --> 02:20:59,627
There are two sides to that
question.

1567
02:20:59,627 --> 02:21:02,217
Ther are several sides to that
question, Mr. Schermerhorn.

1568
02:21:02,217 --> 02:21:03,847
But only one right side.

1569
02:21:03,847 --> 02:21:06,057
As with any question, it
holds the abuse...

1570
02:21:06,057 --> 02:21:07,097
...of any executive power.

1571
02:21:07,097 --> 02:21:09,017
In any case, Mr. Greely...

1572
02:21:09,017 --> 02:21:11,977
...we can all be thankful, it
wasn't any worse.

1573
02:21:12,517 --> 02:21:14,187
It may be worse yet, sir.

1574
02:21:14,187 --> 02:21:15,897
I saw them. I don't know
what to think...

1575
02:21:15,897 --> 02:21:18,737
What is it you are so fond of
saying, Mr. Tweed?

1576
02:21:18,737 --> 02:21:20,527
Mr. Greely, you won't like this...

1577
02:21:20,527 --> 02:21:21,607
...but what is it?

1578
02:21:21,607 --> 02:21:22,697
I don't remember.

1579
02:21:22,697 --> 02:21:25,327
You can always hire one half
of the poor...

1580
02:21:25,327 --> 02:21:26,868
...to kill the other half.

1581
02:21:37,958 --> 02:21:39,298
I've come to say goodbye.

1582
02:21:40,678 --> 02:21:42,548
I've booked passage for
California.

1583
02:21:46,058 --> 02:21:48,178
Jenny, give me one more day and
I'll go with you.

1584
02:21:48,978 --> 02:21:50,268
You'll be dead by then.

1585
02:21:51,938 --> 02:21:53,188
What would you have me do?

1586
02:21:53,188 --> 02:21:54,018
I don't know.

1587
02:21:58,028 --> 02:21:59,528
This will all be finished
tomorrow.

1588
02:21:59,988 --> 02:22:01,029
No it won't.

1589
02:22:05,489 --> 02:22:07,579
This whole place is going to
burn anyway.

1590
02:22:16,709 --> 02:22:20,089
I've heard of the poor are going
from door to door...

1591
02:22:20,089 --> 02:22:24,549
...in the Five Points, asking those
supporters for further riots...

1592
02:22:25,089 --> 02:22:27,259
...to place a candle in the
window.

1593
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:30,519
Irish, Poles, Germans.

1594
02:22:31,599 --> 02:22:34,519
Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...

1595
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,480
...I prophesise a dark night.

1596
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:01,630
Nobody goes to work today.

1597
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:03,840
We're shutting the factories down!

1598
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,720
When the sun rose next...

1599
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:08,010
...the city had split in half.

1600
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:10,601
From all over New York
they came...

1601
02:23:10,601 --> 02:23:13,311
...ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners!

1602
02:23:13,311 --> 02:23:15,191
Irish, Polish, German...

1603
02:23:15,191 --> 02:23:17,981
...anyone who never cared about
slavery in the Union.

1604
02:23:18,521 --> 02:23:20,111
Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.

1605
02:23:21,151 --> 02:23:22,281
Let the sons of the rich...

1606
02:23:22,281 --> 02:23:23,781
....go and die they cried.

1607
02:23:24,241 --> 02:23:25,571
Let the sons of the poor...

1608
02:23:25,571 --> 02:23:26,781
...stay home.

1609
02:23:28,451 --> 02:23:30,161
The earth was shaking now.

1610
02:23:31,161 --> 02:23:33,371
But I was about my father's business.

1611
02:23:48,472 --> 02:23:49,932
Oh, mighty Lord...

1612
02:23:50,762 --> 02:23:52,932
...you are the dagger in
my hand.

1613
02:23:54,062 --> 02:23:56,442
Guide my hand on this day of
vengeance.

1614
02:23:56,442 --> 02:23:58,522
We give thanks to the Lord....

1615
02:23:58,942 --> 02:24:00,482
...for He is good.

1616
02:24:01,072 --> 02:24:03,362
With you, the swift cannot flee.

1617
02:24:03,362 --> 02:24:05,282
Nor the strong escape.

1618
02:24:05,282 --> 02:24:09,492
Let my sword devour, till its thirst
is quenched with blood....

1619
02:24:09,492 --> 02:24:11,372
...and my enemy sleeps forever.

1620
02:24:11,872 --> 02:24:14,162
For you and the God of
retribution.

1621
02:24:14,162 --> 02:24:16,662
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

1622
02:24:16,662 --> 02:24:18,503
The Lord is merciful.

1623
02:24:20,213 --> 02:24:23,343
And his love endures forever.

1624
02:24:24,423 --> 02:24:25,133
Amen.

1625
02:24:25,133 --> 02:24:25,843
Amen.

Amen.

ransacking houses...

Get him!

1649
02:25:37,705 --> 02:25:39,215
Did your daddy buy you out of
the army!

1650
02:25:39,505 --> 02:25:40,925

I order you to disperse.

1709
02:28:57,581 --> 02:28:58,831
Fire!

1710
02:29:34,872 --> 02:29:36,332

Drive them into the square.

1713
02:30:18,493 --> 02:30:19,503
Bill!

1714
02:30:32,434 --> 02:30:33,434
Bill!

1715
02:32:15,407 --> 02:32:16,287
Bastards!

1716
02:32:16,287 --> 02:32:17,417
Shang!Hold on!

1717
02:32:51,368 --> 02:32:53,198
Thank God.

1718
02:32:54,408 --> 02:32:55,788
I die a true American.

1719
02:34:59,491 --> 02:35:00,291
Tomorrow morning...

1720
02:35:00,291 --> 02:35:01,911
...get our people down to
the docks.

1721
02:35:02,621 --> 02:35:04,832
I want every man and woman
coming off the boats...

1722
02:35:05,122 --> 02:35:06,712
...given hot soup and bread.

1723
02:35:11,882 --> 02:35:14,432
We're burying a lot of votes
here tonight.

1724
02:35:33,032 --> 02:35:34,112
In the end....

1725
02:35:34,112 --> 02:35:35,992
...they put candles on the
bodies...

1726
02:35:35,992 --> 02:35:38,823
...so their friends, if they
had any...

1727
02:35:39,913 --> 02:35:41,493
...could know them in the dark.

1728
02:35:43,253 --> 02:35:45,713
The city did this free
of charge.

1729
02:35:47,793 --> 02:35:53,133
Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.
McGloin and more.

1730
02:35:55,513 --> 02:35:57,053
Friend or foe...

1731
02:35:57,683 --> 02:35:59,473
...it didn't make no difference
now.

1732
02:36:19,574 --> 02:36:21,204
It was four days and nights...

1733
02:36:21,204 --> 02:36:24,334
..before the worst of the mob
was finally put down.

1734
02:36:26,414 --> 02:36:28,874
We never knew how many New
Yorkers died...

1735
02:36:28,874 --> 02:36:31,674
...that week, before the city
was finally delivered.

1736
02:36:33,634 --> 02:36:37,554
My father told me we was all
born of blood and tribulation.

1737
02:36:39,644 --> 02:36:43,224
And so then too, was our
great city.

1738
02:36:46,895 --> 02:36:48,235
But for those of us who...

1739
02:36:48,235 --> 02:36:50,775
...lived and died in them
furious days...

1740
02:36:51,815 --> 02:36:53,655
...it was like everything we
knew...

1741
02:36:54,155 --> 02:36:56,155
...was mildly swept away.

1742
02:36:57,995 --> 02:37:01,415
And no matter what they did to
build this city up again...

1743
02:37:03,375 --> 02:37:04,915
...for the rest of time...

1744
02:37:07,082 --> 02:37:11,378
...it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.

1745
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,057
