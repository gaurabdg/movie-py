51
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,789
"Why do you refuse to talk?"

52

already Hollywood's new sweetheart!
How do you explain that?"

56
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,165
"I don't know. Maybe because I talk
and the audience can hear me."

57
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:19,678
"People are tired of old actors mugging
at the camera to be understood."

You're fired."

He needs rest now."

91
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:47,422
"He was clutching this. It was
hard to get it away from him."

92
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:28,547
"You think he could
rest at my house?"

93
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:43,557
"I have to be on the set at nine o'clock.
We're shooting a very important scene."

It's either him or me."

98

"It's impossible, Peppy. I'm washed up.
No one wants to see me speak."
