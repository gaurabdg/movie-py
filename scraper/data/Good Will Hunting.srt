they won´t be honest with you.

It´s like the Nobel prize for math.

Except they only give it out once

this old math book,

1435
01:35:04,201 --> 01:35:07,370
- I got-- I got--
- Who ?

1436
01:35:07,438 --> 01:35:10,474
- I got plenty.
- Well, name ´em.

1437
01:35:10,574 --> 01:35:13,577
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O´Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke--

1438
01:35:13,677 --> 01:35:15,880
That´s great.
They´re all dead.

1439
01:35:15,946 --> 01:35:19,050
- Not to me they´re not.
- You don´t have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1440
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:22,553
You can´t give back
to them, Will.

1441
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:26,991
- Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.
- That´s what l´m saying.

1442
01:35:27,057 --> 01:35:30,594
You´ll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1443
01:35:30,695 --> 01:35:33,130
where you´re always afraid
to take the first step,

1444
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:37,000
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1445
01:35:37,068 --> 01:35:39,070
- You gonna take the
professor´s side on this ?
- Don´t give me a line of shit.

1446
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,105
- No.
- I didn´t want the job.

1447
01:35:41,172 --> 01:35:43,141
It´s not about the job. I don´t care
if you work for the government.

1448
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:46,345
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1449
01:35:46,411 --> 01:35:51,416
What are you passionate about ?
What do you want ?

1450
01:35:51,516 --> 01:35:53,885
There are guys who work
their entire life layin´ brick...

1451
01:35:53,952 --> 01:35:56,221
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1452
01:35:56,288 --> 01:35:58,756
- I didn´t ask for this.
- No.

1453
01:35:58,857 --> 01:36:01,326
You were born with it, so don´t cop out
behind: "l didn´t ask for this."

1454
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:05,197
- What do you mean, cop out ?
What´s wrong with layin´ brick ?
- Nothing.

1455
01:36:05,263 --> 01:36:07,565
There´s nothin´ wrong.
That´s somebody´s home l´m buildin´.

1456
01:36:07,633 --> 01:36:10,503
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay ?

1457
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:12,504
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1458
01:36:12,571 --> 01:36:14,773
Exactly. That´s
an honorable profession.

1459
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,775
What´s wrong with
fixin´ somebody´s car ?

1460
01:36:16,842 --> 01:36:18,777
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That´s honor in that.

1461
01:36:18,844 --> 01:36:20,780
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1462
01:36:20,846 --> 01:36:23,182
There´s honor in takin´
that 40-minute train ride...

1463
01:36:23,248 --> 01:36:25,718
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

1464
01:36:25,818 --> 01:36:28,821
- And their wastebaskets
are empty. That´s real work.
- That´s right.

1465
01:36:28,921 --> 01:36:31,890
And that´s honorable. I´m sure
that´s why you took that job.

1466
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,992
I mean, for the honor of it.

1467
01:36:34,093 --> 01:36:38,731
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1468
01:36:38,797 --> 01:36:42,501
Why did you work at the most
prestigious technical college
in the whole fuckin´ world ?

1469
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:45,871
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people´s formulas...

1470
01:36:45,938 --> 01:36:51,844
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it ?

1471
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:54,881
´Cause I don´t see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1472
01:36:58,084 --> 01:37:00,753
So what do you
really wanna do ?

1473
01:37:04,123 --> 01:37:06,092
I wanna be a shepherd.

1474
01:37:06,226 --> 01:37:08,027
Really ?

1475
01:37:08,094 --> 01:37:12,065
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread,
get some sheep and tend to them.

1476
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:15,067
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What ?

1477
01:37:15,135 --> 01:37:18,104
You know, if you´re gonna
jerk off, why don´t you just do
it at home with a moist towel ?

1478
01:37:18,171 --> 01:37:20,140
- You´re chuckin´ me ?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1479
01:37:20,206 --> 01:37:22,175
- No, no, no, time´s not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1480
01:37:22,242 --> 01:37:24,911
- I´m not leavin´. No.
- You´re not gonna answer,
you´re wastin´ my time.

1481
01:37:24,978 --> 01:37:26,947
I thought we were friends.

1482
01:37:27,013 --> 01:37:30,650
- Playtime´s over, okay ?
- Why are you kickin´ me out ?

1483
01:37:30,717 --> 01:37:34,054
You´re lecturin´ me on life ?
Look at you, you fuckin´ burnout.

1484
01:37:34,121 --> 01:37:36,356
- What winds your clock ?
- Workin´ with you.

1485
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:39,526
Where´s your soul mate ? You wanna
talk about soul mates ? Where is she ?

1486
01:37:39,593 --> 01:37:41,728
- Dead.
- That´s right. She´s fuckin´ dead.

1487
01:37:41,795 --> 01:37:44,531
She fuckin´ dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away ?

1488
01:37:44,597 --> 01:37:48,803
- At least I played a hand.
- You played a hand and you lost.
You lost a big fuckin´ hand.

1489
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:52,272
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1490
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:55,442
Look at me.
What do you wanna do ?

1491
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:06,621
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1492
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:10,425
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can´t give me a straight answer,

1493
01:38:10,491 --> 01:38:14,461
because you don´t know.

1494
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,332
I´ll see ya, Bo-peep.

1495
01:38:21,303 --> 01:38:23,437
- Fuck you.
- You´re the shepherd.

1496
01:38:28,175 --> 01:38:30,411
Shepherd.

1497
01:38:30,478 --> 01:38:32,580
[ WhHISPERS ]
White little prick.

1498
01:38:33,815 --> 01:38:35,783
I just wanted to,
you know, um,

1499
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:39,354
call you up,
uh, before you left, um--

1500
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,056
I´ve been takin´ all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

1501
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,059
so l´m not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1502
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,828
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

1503
01:38:48,329 --> 01:38:50,298
Yeah.

1504
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:54,803
I love you.

1505
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:01,643
Will ?

1506
01:39:01,709 --> 01:39:04,546
You take care.

Will !

1525
01:40:20,189 --> 01:40:22,292
Will, that´s it !
We´re done !

1526
01:40:22,358 --> 01:40:27,097
I´m sitting in your office
and the boy isn´t here.

1527
01:40:27,164 --> 01:40:29,199
Well, it´s ten past 5:00.

1528
01:40:29,266 --> 01:40:31,301
An hour and
ten minutes late.

# I can make you satisfied
in everything #

1530
01:40:34,772 --> 01:40:38,275
Well, if he doesn´t show up and I file
a report saying he wasn´t here...

1531
01:40:38,342 --> 01:40:42,246
and he goes back to jail,
he won´t be on my conscience.

# Now be coming true #

1533
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,252
Okay. Fine.

1534
01:40:49,787 --> 01:40:52,590
What´s up ?

1535
01:40:53,657 --> 01:40:55,592
Thanks.

1536
01:40:58,229 --> 01:41:02,133
Ah ! God, that´s good.

1537
01:41:05,937 --> 01:41:08,439
So how´s your lady ?

1538
01:41:08,506 --> 01:41:11,342
Ah, she´s gone.

1539
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:13,744
Gone ? Gone where ?

1540
01:41:13,811 --> 01:41:17,482
Med school.
Medical school in California.

1541
01:41:17,548 --> 01:41:19,484
- Really ?
- Yeah.

1542
01:41:19,551 --> 01:41:22,521
- When was this ?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1543
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:28,827
That sucks.

1544
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:35,366
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings ?

1545
01:41:35,434 --> 01:41:37,469
I think the week
after l´m 21.

1546
01:41:37,535 --> 01:41:40,272
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what ?

1547
01:41:40,339 --> 01:41:44,576
Yeah, fuckin´ sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1548
01:41:44,643 --> 01:41:48,047
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

1549
01:41:48,113 --> 01:41:50,082
I´m gonna be
a fuckin´ lab rat.

1550
01:41:50,148 --> 01:41:53,519
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1551
01:41:53,585 --> 01:41:55,821
What do I want a way
outta here for ?

1552
01:41:55,888 --> 01:41:58,156
I mean, l´m gonna fuckin´
live here the rest of my life.

1553
01:41:58,224 --> 01:42:00,325
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1554
01:42:00,393 --> 01:42:04,996
Fuckin´ take ´em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1555
01:42:06,566 --> 01:42:09,968
Look, you´re my best friend,
so don´t take this the wrong way.

1556
01:42:10,035 --> 01:42:12,938
But in 20 years if
you´re still livin´ here,

1557
01:42:13,005 --> 01:42:16,275
comin´ over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

1558
01:42:16,342 --> 01:42:18,644
still workin´ construction,
l´ll fuckin´ kill ya.

1559
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:21,280
That´s not a threat. That´s a fact.
I´ll fuckin´ kill ya.

1560
01:42:21,347 --> 01:42:23,516
What the fuck
are you talkin´ about ?

1561
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:26,786
- Look, you got something
none of us have.
- Oh, come on !

1562
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:30,724
Why is it always this ? I fuckin´
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1563
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:34,961
- What if I don´t want to ?
- No, no, no. Fuck you.
You don´t owe it to yourself.

1564
01:42:35,027 --> 01:42:37,262
You owe it to me,

1565
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:39,899
´cause tomorrow l´m gonna
wake up and l´ll be 50,

1566
01:42:39,966 --> 01:42:42,468
and l´ll still
be doin´ this shit.

1567
01:42:42,535 --> 01:42:45,071
That´s all right.
That´s fine.

1568
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:47,741
I mean, you´re sittin´ on
a winnin´ lottery ticket.

1569
01:42:47,807 --> 01:42:51,511
You´re too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that´s bullshit.

1570
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:56,449
´Cause l´d do fuckin´ anything
to have what you got.

1571
01:42:56,516 --> 01:42:59,386
So would any of
these fuckin´ guys.

1572
01:42:59,453 --> 01:43:02,122
Be an insult to us
if you´re still here in 20 years.

1573
01:43:02,189 --> 01:43:04,758
Hangin´ around here
is a fuckin´ waste of your time.

1574
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:06,960
- You don´t know that.
- I don´t ?

1575
01:43:07,026 --> 01:43:10,531
- No. You don´t know that.
- Oh, I don´t know that.
Let me tell you what I do know.

1576
01:43:10,597 --> 01:43:14,468
Every day I come by your house,
