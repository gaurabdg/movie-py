2
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,700
There are over 550 million firearms
in worldwide circulation.

3
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,788
That's one firearm
for every 12 people on the planet.

4
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,998
The only question is,

5
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,836
how do we arm the other 11?

6
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,901
You don't have to worry.

7
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,196
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies
to make me look good.

8
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,782
I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

9
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,784
My name is Yuri Orlov.

10
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,996
When I was a boy,
my family came to America,

11
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,998
but not all the way.

12
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,710
Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.

13
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,212
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

14
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,424
I soon realized we'd just swapped
one hell for another.

15
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,178
Even in hell,
an angel sometimes makes an appearance.

16
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,558
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was 10 years old.

17
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,144
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

18
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,731
I was starting to think she had a point.

19
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,486
For the first 20-odd years of my life,

20
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,781
Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train.

21
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,825
The end of the line.

22
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,288
Oh, I did lie about my name.

23
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,457
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

24
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,751
There have been few occasions
in the 20th century

25
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,295
when it's been an advantage to be a Jew.

26
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,050
But in the '70s, to escape the Soviet Union
our family pretended to be Jewish.

27
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,053
Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.

28
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,639
- How's it going, brother?
- It's not.

29
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,933
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

30
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,644
He was as lost as me.
He just didn't know it yet.

31
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,938
Yuri, kouda prava, you're late.

32
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,904
My father took his assumed identity
to heart.

33
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,742
He was more Jewish than most Jews,
which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

34
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,453
How many times? I can't eat shellfish.

35
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,539
<i>- It's trayf. • unfit to be eaten •
- You're not Jewish.</i>

36
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,999
I like it.

37
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,710
I like the hat.

38
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,880
To remind us there is something above us.

39
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,633
I like that.

40
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,679
- I'm going to temple.
- You're not going to temple.

41
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,932
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

42
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,815
Yuri, don't forget to check the specials
at the Palace.

43
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,654
Growing up in Little Odessa,
murder was an everyday part of life.

44
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,074
Russian mobsters had also migrated
from the Soviet Union.

45
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,536
And when they came to America,
their baggage came with them.

46
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,749
There was always some gangster
getting whacked in my neighborhood,

47
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,876
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

48
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,380
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

49
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,965
or five minutes after.

50
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,299
Not that day.

51
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,033
It hit me.

52
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,328
It couldn't have hit me harder
if I was the one who'd been shot.

53
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,289
You go into the restaurant business

54
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,417
because people are always
going to have to eat.

55
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,714
That was the day I realized my destiny lay
in fulfilling another basic human need.

56
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,053
The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

57
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,557
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

58
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,809
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

59
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,522
My contact at synagogue landed me
my first Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns.

60
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,822
The first time you sell a gun
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

61
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,618
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, but it is exciting,

62
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,996
and one way or another,
it's over way too fast.

63
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,920
Gentlemen, the new Uzi machine pistol,

64
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,755
big firepower in a small package.

65
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,926
This little baby uses 9mm hollowpoints,
20, 25-round extendable mags,

66
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,594
rear-flip adjustable sights.

67
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,679
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

68
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,099
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

69
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,894
You could pump a mag into me right now

70
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,772
and never wake the guy in the next room.

71
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,026
Of course, that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

72
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,156
I did have a natural instinct
for smuggling contraband.

73
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,619
Fortunately, back then a video camera
was as big as a bazooka.

74
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,963
Here, I'd been running away from violence
my whole life,

75
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,507
and I should have been running toward it.

76
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,551
It's in our nature.

77
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,471
The earliest human skeletons
had spearheads in their ribcages.

78
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,486
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

79
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,488
God bless America.

80
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,671
Yeah?

81
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,721
"Beware of the dog"?

82
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,848
You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare people?

83
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,558
No, it's to scare me.

84
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,144
Remind me to beware of the dog in me.

85
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,855
The dog that wants
to fuck everything that moves,

86
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,648
wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

87
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,901
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

88
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,195
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

89
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,033
What if that's the best part of you,
the dog part?

90
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,369
What if you're really just a two-legged dog?

91
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,582
You need to see somebody.

92
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,334
It stinks in here.

93
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,420
I'd always wanted to do something big
with my life.

94
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,422
I just didn't know what.

95
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,759
Anyhow, I figured if I was going
into the gun trade,

96
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,677
I was going to aim high.

97
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,555
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

98
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,227
You read the newspapers, V?

99
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,731
The newspaper? It's always the same.

100
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,068
You're right. Every day
there's people shooting each other.

101
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,236
You know what I do when I see that?

102
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,074
I look to see what guns they're using,
and I think to myself, "Why not my guns?"

103
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,408
What, you opening a gun shop?

104
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,244
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

105
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,123
Even with all the gangsters around here,
the margins are too low.

106
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,417
- You've worked out the margins?
- Sure.

107
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,212
Forget gang wars.

108
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,924
The real money's in actual wars
between countries.

109
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,511
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

110
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,222
I know which end I'd rather be on.

111
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,686
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

112
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,107
Whoa. We?

113
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,566
I need a partner.

114
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,949
I don't know.
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

115
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,910
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
You're no fucking chef.

116
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,038
I can eat in the restaurant for free
and I still don't eat there.

117
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,289
Fuck you.

118
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,291
We're doing nothing with our lives.

119
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,798
I mean, this is shit. This is shit.

120
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,426
That's true.

121
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,888
But maybe doing nothing's better
than doing this.

122
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,810
I need you.

123
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,626
Sir, sir,

124
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,881
may I interest you in the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missile?

125
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,299
It's the older Chinese model.

126
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,676
Not so effective
against modern military aircraft,

127
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,471
but deadly if used
against a commercial airliner.

128
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,681
I'm giving them away at $850.

129
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,436
It was the '80s, and the Cold War
was far from thawed.

130
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,813
Most of the deals were
government to government.

131
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,650
And it was a mostly private club
with a lifetime club president.

132
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,862
- That's him.
- Who, the big shot?

133
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,864
Simeon Weisz.

134
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,618
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

135
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,370
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

136
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,831
I'll be right back.

137
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,587
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

138
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,131
It's okay. They're talking.

139
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,883
- May I help?
- Yes.

140
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,553
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman,
from Brighton Beach, import, exports,

141
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,805
said to contact you.

142
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,017
I have a business proposal
and I thought perhaps we could discuss it.

143
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,978
I don't think you and I
are in the same business, son.

144
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,023
You think I just sell guns, don't you?

145
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't. I take sides.

146
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,612
But in the Iran-Iraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

147
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,241
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

148
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,745
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

149
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,042
You're in the wrong place, my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.

150
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,800
Curious how you always revert
to your native tongue

151
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,552
in moments of extreme anger

152
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,929
and ecstasy.

153
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,611
Oh, you are beautiful.

154
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,780
What's your name again?

155
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,665
The only option for Vitaly and me
was under the counter gunrunning.

156
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,421
I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.

157
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,634
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

158
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,226
When the United States leaves a war zone,
they generally don't take their munitions.

159
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,688
It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.

160
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,734
So, we sell by the kilo.

161
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,486
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're still okay.

162
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,701
- How many kilos would you like?
- 5,000.

163
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,620
I had a flair for languages.

164
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,915
But I soon discovered
that what talks best is dollars,

165
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,752
dinars, drachmas, rubles,
rupees and pounds-fucking-sterling.

166
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,005
Of course, the US Army
got a piece of the action.

167
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,508
Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.

168
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,637
And some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern,

169
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,514
needed to raise money
for their own private wars.

170
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,600
Good to make your acquaintance.

171
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,104
This is bullshit money, V.
This is small fucking potatoes.

172
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,731
What do you want to do, go more legit?

173
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,524
No, more illegal.

174
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,362
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

175
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,557
It's not our fight.

176
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,518
V, come on.

177
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,729
Let's go. Come on.

178
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,910
Selling guns is like
selling vacuum cleaners.

179
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,788
You make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.

180
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,124
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

181
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,002
I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.

182
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,507
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

183
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,682
I sold communist-made bullets to fascists.

184
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:19,120
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan
when they were fighting my fellow Soviets.

185
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,622
I never sold to Osama bin Laden.

186
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,960
Not on any moral grounds.
Back then, he was always bouncing checks.

187
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,637
By the mid '80s,

188
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,808
my weapons were represented
in eight of the world's top 10 war zones.

189
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,006
There's no problem leading a double life.

190
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,009
It's the triple and quadruple lives
that get you in the end.

191
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,388
Back then, I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport

192
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,017
and a student visa for the US.
But that's another story.

193
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,271
I also packed six different briefcases,
depending on who I was that day

194
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,524
and the region of the world I was visiting.

195
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,531
Without operations like mine,

196
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,993
it would be impossible for certain countries
to conduct a respectable war.

197
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:45,456
I was able to navigate around
those inconvenient little arms embargoes.

198
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,708
There are three basic types of arms deal.

199
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,545
White being legal, black being illegal

200
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,422
and my personal favorite color, gray.

201
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,134
Sometimes I made the deals so convoluted,

202
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,011
it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.

203
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,223
To keep authorities in the dark,
I often spoke in code.

204
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,351
Rocket launchers were "mothers,"
the rockets, "children. "

205
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,313
The AK-47 assault rifle
was the "angel king. "

206
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,773
It's Yuri.

207
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,443
Yeah, well, yeah, Raoul...

208
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,864
Raoul, the angel king will arrive tomorrow.

209
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,200
Hallelujah to you, too. All right.

210
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,744
The point is, if I've done my job right,

211
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,665
an arms embargo should be practically
impossible to enforce.

212
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,004
What? Okay, just slow the fuck down.

213
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,965
I can't understand you. What?

214
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,051
What do you mean, tipped off?
They know where we are?

215
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,388
Well, where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

216
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,516
Not long? What does that mean? Shit.

217
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,351
- Do we try to lose them?
- On this?

218
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,105
- Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
- No, no one's going anywhere. Slow.

219
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,399
Dead slow. Buy me time.

220
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,280
Yeah, it's Yuri. Get that fucking rag down!

221
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,449
I need another handle for this tub.

222
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,618
Something in our weight class.

223
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,496
You, over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

224
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,791
Yes, it's gotta check out.

225
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,794
The way I looked at it, what's in a name?

226
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,129
Have you got a shorter name?

227
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,382
I'd often change the registration
of a ship or a plane.

228
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,509
But never at such short notice.

229
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,640
Damn, they're hauling.

230
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,603
What? "Kono. "
How do you spell that? K-O-N-O.

231
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,313
Okay, well, that's good. Kono.

232
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,815
K- O-N-O.

233
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,943
What are we flying? Dutch. Got it.

234
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,736
V, get me a Dutch flag, would you?

235
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,625
Faster or I'll send your ass in!

236
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,043
Yuri, I don't have Dutch.

237
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,836
- What?
- I've got Belgium.

238
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,879
What the fuck use is that?

239
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,590
He's painting a name
registered in the fucking Netherlands.

240
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,302
- I've got a French flag.
- So?

241
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,305
Turn it sideways, it's Dutch.

242
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,059
That's why you're my brother.

243
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,209
All right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

244
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,054
They say every man has his price.

245
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,223
But not every man gets it.

246
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,143
Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,

247
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,728
at least not with money.

248
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,023
For Jack, glory was the prize.

249
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,608
Yeah, it's the Kono.
It's not the Kristol.

250
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,236
Kono. K-O-N-O.

251
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,114
- It's clean, sir.
- It's clean?

252
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,325
Sure doesn't look clean.

253
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,909
I'm gonna go aboard.

254
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,954
Phone in a sighting of the Kristol
south of Aruba.

255
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,922
Even when I was up against
an overzealous agent,

256
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,134
I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.

257
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,013
I routinely mislabeled
my arms shipments "farm machinery. "

258
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,932
And I have yet to meet
the lowly paid customs official

259
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,935
who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"

260
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,271
to verify its contents.

261
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,899
But my personal favorite
is the unique combination

262
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,110
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

263
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,168
It smells.

264
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,090
Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.

265
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,594
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people on the payroll

266
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,847
to supply their colleagues
with counterintelligence.

267
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,140
Let's go.

268
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,196
The second rule of gunrunning is,

269
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,324
always ensure you have a foolproof way
to get paid.

270
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,036
Preferably in advance,
ideally to an offshore account.

271
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,997
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

272
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,667
Say what you like
about warlords and dictators.

273
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,378
They tend to have
a highly developed sense of order.

274
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,672
They always pay their bills on time.

275
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,695
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

276
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,665
What the fuck are you doing?

277
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,250
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

278
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,299
No, V.

279
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,553
Shit.

280
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,973
The first and most important rule
of gunrunning

281
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,726
is never get shot
with your own merchandise.

282
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,187
You okay?

283
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,481
I think so.

284
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,318
- So what do we do now?
- Let's celebrate.

285
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,587
God.

286
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,928
That narco-guerilla had his facts right.

287
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,430
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

288
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,432
netted me a healthy profit.

289
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,560
It would have been even better,
except one kilo never made it back.

290
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,646
Vitaly.

291
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,898
V.

292
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,072
To this day, I don't know what
Vitaly was running away from.

293
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,949
Maybe just from Vitaly.

294
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,120
I found him 12 days, 2,000 miles
and 150 grams later

295
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,789
in a Bolivian boarding house.

296
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,421
Of course, my dream girl
had gotten there before me.

297
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,638
V.

298
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,899
Come on.

299
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,335
Yuri. It's my brother, Yuri.

300
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,838
He's my big brother.

301
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,341
What the fuck is that?

302
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,177
Ukraine. I was young.

303
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,680
But I remember. Look.

304
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,351
I start in Odessa, right?
And then I work my way to the Crimean.

305
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,062
You're gonna be dead
before you fucking reach Kiev.

306
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,481
- Come on, we're going home.
- You fuck!

307
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,569
You fucking fuck! You fucking fuck!

308
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,696
What the fuck is your problem?

309
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,204
Come on, Vit.

310
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,584
It's so nice to be home.

311
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,377
Yeah, we're... We're gonna get you home.

312
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,879
Come on.

313
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,266
Get out of the car.

314
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,731
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

315
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,818
I promised our parents.

316
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,404
Please.

317
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,032
Vitaly, you're gonna have a great time.
This is a top place.

318
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,992
Two Ford models checked in last week.

319
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,078
And that cute weathergirl's
been here since July.

320
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,330
Please, please.

321
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,415
Please, Yuri.

322
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,435
You're a good brother.

323
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,438
Okay.

324
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,941
- You're a good brother, Yuri.
- Okay, all right.

325
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,486
- Good brother.
- All right, get out of the car. Okay.

326
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,823
Get out of the car.

327
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,124
From then on, I was a one-man operation.

328
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,502
I never understood what separated
the recreational drug user

329
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,130
from the habitual, but for the grace of God,

330
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,758
it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the Belt Parkway.

331
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,388
However, I wasn't entirely free
of the grip of addiction myself.

332
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,349
There she was again. Ava Fontaine.

333
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,519
In my neighborhood,
they say, "The good get out. "

334
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,147
In our own ways,
we'd both conquered the world.

335
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,666
You can't force someone
to fall in love with you.

336
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,210
But you can definitely improve your odds.

337
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,006
It cost me $20,000
to book her for a fake photo shoot.

338
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,717
Another $12,000 to buy out the hotel.

339
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,512
It's a popular hotel, huh?

340
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,684
- Ava Fontaine.
- Yuri Orlov.

341
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,603
What brings you to St. Barts?

342
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,231
Photo shoot. At least that was the plan.

343
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,067
Guess the photographer
got stuck in Miami.

344
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,736
Hurricane, though there's nothing
on the news.

345
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,073
Those things can come out of nowhere.

346
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,118
So, the job's been canceled,
and wouldn't you know it,

347
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,371
there's no flight back to New York
until Tuesday.

348
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,415
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

349
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,419
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

350
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,005
In my experience,

351
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,801
some of the most successful relationships
are based on lies and deceit.

352
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,803
Since that's where they
usually end up anyway,

353
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,721
it's a logical place to start.

354
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,932
Right there. Right there. Hold it.

355
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,767
Oh, my God!

356
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,440
I nearly went broke
trying to convince her I was anything but.

357
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,654
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet,

358
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,489
unless you owned the jet.

359
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,616
This is your plane?

360
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,451
That is my name.

361
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,911
Of course I was lying.

362
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,582
The plane was a rental like the car
and even the suit I was standing in.

363
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,585
At the last minute,
I bribed the crew for the paint job.

364
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,753
Luckily by the time we landed,

365
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,673
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

366
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,467
I had no idea.

367
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,637
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

368
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,724
Don't apologize.
I put clothes on for a living.

369
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,684
Well, at least you're not taking them off.

370
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,645
I would be if half the photographers
had their way.

371
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,564
What about you?

372
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,901
I'm in transport.
International air freight mostly.

373
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,569
Business is good.

374
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,697
Where are you from?

375
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,991
I was born in Ukraine
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

376
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,118
- No.
- What, you, too?

377
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,661
Williamsburg.

378
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,125
Well, here's to a hurricane.

379
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,545
Without it I never would have met you.

380
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,299
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

381
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,430
It feels like fate.

382
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,391
I don't believe in fate.

383
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,645
What do you believe in?

384
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,188
Is that a view or is that a view?

385
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,982
That's a view.

386
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,328
Thank you. Thank you all.

387
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,418
Congratulations.

388
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,752
Thanks.

389
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,174
Always remember, Son,
there's something above you.

390
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,761
Sure, Dad. A $40,000 crystal chandelier.

391
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,558
Make yourselves at home.

392
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,977
Go. Go!

393
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,744
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

394
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,582
Be nice to have a couple more guests
from my side of the family.

395
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,834
I'm sure they're watching right now.

396
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,669
Thank you.

397
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,631
But you don't believe that, Yuri.
Remember?

398
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,722
I know you, Yuri.
I know you're not everything you seem.

399
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,060
Don't worry. I won't ask a lot of questions.

400
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,645
I don't want to hear you lie.

401
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,315
You take risks.

402
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,652
Just promise me you won't risk us.

403
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,115
That's the trouble with falling in love
with a dream girl.

404
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,618
They have a habit of becoming real.

405
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,667
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

406
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,337
- So fucking beautiful!
- Oh!

407
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:56,676
Brother, brother, thank you so much
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

408
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,221
He was out of rehab and out of his mind.

409
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,389
Dance! Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

410
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,059
- All right, all right.
- It's a wedding. A celebration. To Yuri!

411
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,478
But for once, he rescued me.

412
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,025
I was still living way beyond my means.

413
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,612
Mortgaged to the hilt,
using one credit card to pay off another.

414
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,365
Anything to keep Ava
in the style to which she had,

415
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,118
thanks largely to me, become accustomed.

416
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,079
Ava. Ava, this is too much.

417
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,622
Yuri likes to spoil you.

418
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,291
Then suddenly,
all my Christmases came at once.

419
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,128
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

420
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,505
That's my grandson!

421
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,882
Yuri, don't you want to see
what your son is doing?

422
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,051
Whoever said it's better to give than receive

423
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,930
never got a Christmas present
like the one I got in 1991

424
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,557
from Mikhail Gorbachev.

425
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,643
- What the hell's the matter?
- It's over! It's over!

426
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,687
- What's over?
- The Cold-fucking-War!

427
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,022
The Soviet-fucking-Union!
The Evil-fucking-Empire.

428
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,483
Mikhail's saying no más.
He's throwing in the towel.

429
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,901
It's over!

430
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,241
- Your son is walking.
- That's incredible, honey.

431
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,249
At least there'll be religious freedom.

432
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,334
Let's hope so.

433
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,462
I think I'll go back for a visit.

434
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,090
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

435
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,429
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

436
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,517
I don't think you're going to Odessa
to sell Pepsi-Cola.

437
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,982
Is this how you want to be remembered?

438
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,988
I don't want to be remembered at all.
If I'm being remembered it means I'm dead.

439
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,117
Merry fucking Christmas!

440
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,494
Who is this, Vitaly?

441
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,123
- I'm Angel.
- Her name really is Angel.

442
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,792
She's a fairy.

443
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,048
Let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.

444
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,299
Come on.

445
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,473
- I love you!
- Come on.

446
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,933
I love you all.

447
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,811
Take this.

448
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,623
I'm going back to Ukraine.

449
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,878
I miss Odessa.

450
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,431
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

451
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,187
Be careful, Yuri. Those things you sell kill.

452
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,066
Inside.

453
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,654
You're high.

454
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,365
Well, it's true.

455
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,203
Hello, Christian.

456
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,172
During the Cold War the Red Army
stationed nearly one million troops

457
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,676
in Ukraine because of its
strategic military importance.

458
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,680
The day after The Wall came down
the paychecks stopped coming.

459
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,059
There's nothing better for an arms dealer
than the combination

460
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,646
of disgruntled soldiers
and warehouses full of weapons.

461
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,152
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

462
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,905
would open a lot of armory doors
in a lot of military bases.

463
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,074
For a start, he was family.

464
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,618
He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army

465
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,163
and he was almost permanently shit-faced.

466
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,624
I can't just sell you
government property, Yuri.

467
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,211
I have to report.

468
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,589
Report to who? Moscow?

469
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,011
As of last week,
Moscow's in a foreign country.

470
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,471
New flag, new boss.

471
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,431
There is no new boss yet.

472
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,058
They're all too busy squabbling

473
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,686
over who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home at the Black Sea.

474
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,022
It's beautiful.

475
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,901
The ones who know don't care anymore
and the ones who care don't know.

476
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,490
Show me your inventory.

477
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:43,254
Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the East and the West

478
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,383
had generated the highest
weapons build-up in history.

479
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,469
The Soviets had guns
coming out of the demon hole.

480
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,722
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

481
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,850
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

482
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,813
Forty thousand.

483
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,940
Is that a four?

484
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,276
Doesn't look like a four to me.
Looks more like a one.

485
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,320
No, it's a four.

486
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,616
It's whatever we say it is because
no one else will know the difference.

487
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,955
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for a battalion.

488
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,542
Your stocks
are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.

489
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,586
You should order more from the factory.

490
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,839
Someone will work it out.

491
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,716
What happens then?

492
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,385
We'll cut them in.

493
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,225
The end of the Cold War was the beginning
of the hottest time in arms dealing.

494
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,436
The arms bazaar was open.

495
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,355
Guided missiles, unguided missiles,

496
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,525
mortars, mines, armored personnel carriers.

497
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,068
Whole tank divisions.

498
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,743
I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships.

499
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,925
The most sophisticated fighting machines,

500
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,803
built for a war with America
that never happened.

501
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,021
Thanks to me,
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

502
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,200
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what comrade Lenin had in mind

503
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,411
when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.

504
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,540
But I wasn't the only one
offering a crash course in capitalism.

505
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,877
I had rivals.

506
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:50,131
Inform your commanding officer
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

507
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,802
You don't know who I am, do you?

508
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,650
You're late.

509
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,194
So it appears.

510
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,102
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

511
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,437
I'm here, aren't I?

512
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,231
Not all of you, I think.

513
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,858
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

514
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,945
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

515
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,072
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

516
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,992
Kept the tensions frozen.

517
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,871
Now it's harder to determine
which side one's on.

518
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,832
Things have become more complicated.

519
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,625
No, it's gotten simpler.

520
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,379
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, Simeon.

521
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,840
I sell to leftists and rightists.

522
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,802
I'd sell to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

523
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,096
Of course, you're not a true internationalist

524
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,890
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

525
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,980
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

526
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,191
There'll have to be order.

527
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:39,115
Instead of cutting each other's throats,
it may be beneficial if we work together.

528
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,366
What do you think?

529
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,038
What do I think?

530
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,082
I think you're the amateur now.

531
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,752
I think you should go with your instincts.

532
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,545
With your first instinct.

533
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

534
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,218
and I'm just not good enough for you now.

535
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,402
The problem with gunrunners going to war

536
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,573
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

537
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,663
This was the chaos
that the Old Guard had always feared.

538
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,750
As far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

539
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,462
But then they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

540
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,424
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state

541
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,302
with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.

542
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:46,265
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus,

543
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,559
all there for the taking.

544
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,566
Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal,

545
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:59,070
nothing was more profitable
than Avtomat Kalashnikova,

546
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,905
model of 1947,

547
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,992
more commonly known
as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.

548
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,079
It's the world's most popular assault rife.

549
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,164
A weapon all fighters love.

550
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,709
An elegantly simple
nine-pound amalgamation

551
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,627
of forged steel and plywood.

552
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,296
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

553
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,800
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud
or filled with sand.

554
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,470
It's so easy, even a child can use it,
and they do.

555
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,556
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

556
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,933
Mozambique put it on their flag.

557
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,643
Since the end of the Cold War

558
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,397
the Kalashnikov has become
the Russian people's greatest export.

559
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:38,151
After that comes vodka, caviar
and suicidal novelists.

560
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,822
One thing's for sure.
No one was lining up to buy their cars.

561
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,314
I thought you were supposed to be
watching out for these people.

562
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,358
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.

563
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,194
You are too greedy, Yuri.

564
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,196
I can't hold him forever.

565
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,157
- I've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

566
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,910
You know the penalty for sanction-busting.

567
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,038
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

568
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,248
Military helicopter.

569
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,046
It's not a military helicopter.

570
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,423
It's a rescue helicopter.

571
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,217
Get to work, son.

572
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,888
The law is on our side.

573
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,284
All right, let me see your papers.

574
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,955
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

575
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,582
- Yuri Orlov.
- Mr. Orlov.

576
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,584
Always in the wrong place at the right time.

577
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,632
We've met before.
Off the coast of Columbia.

578
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,759
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember.

579
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,595
Was it Kono or the Kristol?

580
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:34,141
The crew called that vessel a lot of names,
none of them repeatable in polite company.

581
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,270
- Answer the question.
- The new MP-5.

582
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,772
Would you like a silencer for that?

583
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,566
I need to see your papers.

584
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,486
Dmitri!

585
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:54,370
The end-user certificate for this aircraft
states Burkina Faso.

586
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,748
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

587
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,334
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

588
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,421
- So, you're a humanitarian?
- Absolutely.

589
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,132
This is a military aircraft.

590
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,217
- Not anymore.
- Listen to the nephew.

591
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:12,138
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

592
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,726
The only way you could die from this baby
now is if a food drop hits you.

593
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,064
And this stuff over here?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

594
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,317
But to a different client
at a different address.

595
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,902
That's just a coincidence, is that it?

596
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,696
Do you take me
for a complete fucking fool?

597
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,116
Not complete, sir.
And while I hesitate to tell you your job,

598
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,827
I must point out
that when shipped separately

599
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,704
the weapons and the aircraft both comply

600
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,831
with the current Interpol
trade standards and practices.

601
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,585
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

602
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,837
that's gonna be closed any goddamn day.

603
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,422
But it's not closed.

604
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,176
And while certain people
might interpret this cargo as suspicious,

605
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,510
thank God we live in a world

606
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,846
where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime.

607
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,599
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

608
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,024
I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

609
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,860
And he was the rarest breed
of law enforcement officer.

610
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:12,031
The type who knew I was breaking the law
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

611
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,955
Valentine wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.

612
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,999
My uncle had turned down
a half dozen rival arms dealers.

613
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,377
Sometimes with offers better than mine.

614
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,505
But to Dmitri,
you couldn't put a price on loyalty.

615
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,896
- What was he doing here?
- He is hoping to beat your offer.

616
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,400
I told him
to go have intercourse with himself.

617
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,319
- But Yuri...
- You need to make more payoffs.

618
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,029
- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

619
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,449
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

620
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,869
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

621
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,085
- I am the luckiest man alive.
- You are.

622
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,834
- Hello?
- Ava?

623
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,419
Hi, baby.

624
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,255
You forgot what time it is?

625
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,758
I'm sorry, I...

626
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,844
How was that... Your audition?

627
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,555
They're going in another direction.

628
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,515
Direction of someone who can act.

629
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,184
They don't deserve you.

630
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,689
Where are you? Is everything okay?

631
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,485
It was a rough day at the office.

632
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,945
- Come home.
- Soon.

633
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:18,824
- How's Nicki?
- He misses you. We both do.

634
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,161
It's lonely without you here.

635
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,039
You know I don't like nights.

636
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,999
Ever since my parents...

637
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,052
- Yuri, what's that?
- A party.

638
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,138
I better go.
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

639
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,349
- Kiss Nicki for me.
- I love you.

640
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,271
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

641
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,816
After The Wall came down,

642
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,862
$32 billion worth of arms were stolen
and resold from Ukraine alone.

643
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,199
One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.

644
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,923
The primary market was Africa.

645
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,301
Eleven major conflicts
involving 32 countries

646
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,179
in less than a decade.
A gunrunner's wet dream.

647
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,473
At the time, the West couldn't care less.

648
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,560
They had a white war
in what was left of Yugoslavia.

649
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,271
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia.

650
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,897
"Land of the Free. "

651
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,693
Originally established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,

652
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,904
it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.

653
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,366
The latest was American-educated
self-declared president,

654
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,201
Andre Baptiste.

655
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,000
Mr. Yuri!

656
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,920
I'm Andre Baptiste Jr.

657
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,257
My father would like to meet you.

658
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,633
What an honor.

659
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,596
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

660
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,390
It's a shame. It's a very busy schedule.

661
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,815
It is not,

662
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,444
as they say, optional.

663
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,948
My father is easily offended.

664
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,118
My schedule just freed up.

665
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,499
President Baptiste was my best customer
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

666
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,461
He'd gotten a reputation
for routinely hacking off the limbs

667
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,087
of those who opposed him.

668
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,715
His seven year civil war
has been described as,

669
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,302
"A relentless campaign
of sadistic, wanton violence. "

670
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,138
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

671
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,851
The Glock is interesting.

672
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,146
It's made of a polymer composite.

673
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,815
Many of my clients feel
they can get through airport security

674
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,859
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

675
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,778
Personally, I do not recommend that.

676
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:05,032
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

677
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,035
there is no substitute
for the six inches of muzzle energy

678
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,830
of the. 357 Magnum.
And of course, it will never jam.

679
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,335
Why'd you do that?

680
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,628
What did you say?

681
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,841
Well, now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

682
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,553
How can I sell a used gun?

683
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,474
A used gun.

684
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,851
A used gun?

685
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,188
That's a good one.

686
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,695
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

687
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,698
I try to set an example but it is difficult.

688
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,368
Personally, I blame MTV.

689
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,207
A used gun.

690
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,590
I think you and I, we can do business.

691
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,888
If I thought I was scared of Andre Sr.,
I knew I was scared of Andre Jr.

692
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,725
Like father like son.

693
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,728
The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree.

694
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,646
He was also a cannibal.

695
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,899
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart
while it was still beating

696
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,193
to give him superhuman strength.

697
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,412
Monrovia itself
was like being on another planet.

698
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,789
Planet Monrovia.

699
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,418
From the temperature,
it was obviously a planet close to the sun.

700
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,048
I rarely saw another white man,
and I never left town alone.

701
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:48,594
Outside town was the edge of hell.
I didn't want to even gaze into it.

702
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,305
This is your hotel.

703
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,307
Two stars.

704
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,769
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

705
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,896
Part one, two or three?

706
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,607
- I've only seen part one.
- The M60.

707
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,609
Would you like the armor piercing bullets?

708
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,069
Please.

709
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,156
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

710
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,283
Enjoy.

711
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,802
My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

712
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:35,307
When I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.

713
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,726
Second floor.

714
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,359
In the most AIDS infested region
of the globe,

715
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,653
where one in four is infected,

716
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,113
Andre's idea of a joke

717
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,116
was to put a young Iman
and a young Naomi in my bed

718
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,618
and no condom within a hundred miles.

719
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,009
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

720
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,512
Hi.

721
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,014
We'd be happy to make you happy.

722
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,810
I can't.

723
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,522
I'd love to, but I can't.

724
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:27,359
Don't worry. We don't have anything.

725
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,074
How do you know?

726
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,162
Do we look like it?

727
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,331
What if I have AIDS? Don't you worry?

728
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,626
You worry too much.

729
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:49,381
Why do you worry about something
that can kill you in 10 years,

730
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,385
when there's so many things
that can kill you today?

731
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,097
Now,

732
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,518
how can we make you happy?

733
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,689
By leaving.

734
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,572
These are my Kalashnikov Kids,

735
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,949
my Boy Brigades.

736
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:21,914
I can see what you are thinking,
but we need every man we can get.

737
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,790
Even if they're not men?

738
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,085
A bullet from a 14-year-old
is just as effective

739
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,004
as one from a 40-year-old.

740
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,673
Often more effective.

741
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,471
No one can stop this bath of blood.

742
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,057
It's not bath of blood, it's bloodbath.

743
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,684
Thank you,

744
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,437
but I prefer it my way.

745
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,870
I am not going to pay your asking price.
We are not a rich people.

746
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:05,958
And besides, the market is already flooded
with your Kalashnikovs.

747
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:10,045
Do you realize in some parts of my country
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

748
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,465
But you can't just look at the unit price.
You forget ancillary costs.

749
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,968
End-user certificates
need to be forged and notarized.

750
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,304
Shell companies set up, insurance
purchased, pilots and crews hired.

751
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,098
Not to mention the bribes.

752
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:24,268
You can't get a nut and bolt
out of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

753
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,396
There's one bribe for the nut,
another for the bolt.

754
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,816
Andy, Andy, listen to me.
This is an expensive proposition.

755
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,276
Andy?

756
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,322
I am going to pay you in timber.

757
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,159
Or stones.

758
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,455
Well, I'll take the stones.

759
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,792
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

760
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,170
I know you're planning a new offensive.

761
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,882
If you can delay a week
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

762
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,011
They'd greatly reduce your casualties

763
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,346
and give you
a significant strategic advantage.

764
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,310
You know, they call me the Lord of War,

765
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,645
but perhaps it is you.

766
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,441
It's not Lord of War. It's Warlord.

767
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,570
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

768
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,744
Conflict diamonds
are a common currency in West Africa.

769
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,871
Also referred to as blood diamonds,

770
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,707
since bloodshed
is what they generally finance.

771
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,754
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth.

772
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,922
Even surpassed my lies.

773
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,925
I could even afford
to become a patron of the arts.

774
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,478
I can't believe it.

775
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:53,065
Well, of course it's wonderful. I just...

776
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,692
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

777
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,614
Yes, well, that...
Well, that would be great, too, yeah.

778
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,243
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

779
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,372
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

780
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:12,125
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

781
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,835
- That's fantastic!
- Yes!

782
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,254
Who bought it?

783
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:19,383
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

784
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,635
- This is so wonderful.
- Yeah, how was your trip?

785
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,929
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

786
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,598
Oh, in bed. I'm sorry. He couldn't stay up.

787
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,683
Well, that's best.

788
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,977
My first painting. I'm officially an artist!

789
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,563
- This calls for a drink.
- What doesn't?

790
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,441
Hi.

791
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,778
- Yuri, this is...
- Candy.

792
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,947
- Candy, of course.
- Hi.

793
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,449
Any friend of my brother's

794
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,993
is a friend of my brother's.

795
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,122
You have a beautiful everything.

796
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,375
Yes, he does.

797
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,835
Yes, I do.

798
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,295
- I'm gonna kiss Nicki good night.
- Okay.

799
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,852
How are you, brother?

800
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,689
Oh, you know,
still the resident family fuck up.

801
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,778
- Yeah, well, I guess someone has to do it.
- Yeah.

802
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,783
Hey, Ava knows, right?

803
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,373
I never want to say anything.

804
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,126
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

805
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,212
She's a survivor, like me.

806
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,174
Well, she may be a survivor
but she's not like you.

807
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,596
Really, she doesn't know
how you pay for all this?

808
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,306
We don't talk about it.

809
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,227
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

810
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,770
How many cigarette salesmen?

811
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,231
Both their products
kill more people every year than mine.

812
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,817
At least mine has a safety switch.

813
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,446
If those guys
can leave their work at the office, so can I.

814
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,159
Goddamn, you are good.

815
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,788
You really are.

816
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,958
You almost had me convinced.

817
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,095
Could you...

818
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,267
Could you help me out with some...

819
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:28,446
Why?

820
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,241
Why what?

821
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,703
- Why, why, why, why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

822
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,037
Why what?

823
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,666
Why are you so fucked up all the time?

824
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,132
Because I am.

825
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,938
I didn't know how much Ava really knew
and how much she ignored.

826
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,900
She never questioned
how a guy in the transport business

827
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,819
could afford to give her
18-karat diamond earrings.

828
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,281
I guess she didn't really want
to hear the answer.

829
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:14,492
Mostly, she seemed content
that I was a good provider

830
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,287
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

831
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,080
Despite the other women,

832
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,542
I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one.

833
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,173
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

834
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,260
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.
You gotta be fast on your feet.

835
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,388
Some revolutions blow over
before the guns even get there.

836
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,683
There's nothing more expensive
for an arms dealer than peace.

837
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:42,729
Truce? What do you mean truce?
The guns are already on their way.

838
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,607
Peace talks.

839
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,486
All right, forget it.
I'll reroute the shipment to the Balkans.

840
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,489
When they say they're gonna have a war,
they keep their word.

841
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,000
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner
requires a new breed of cop.

842
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,924
Henry, take Park Avenue.

843
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,361
Take them on a tour of New Jersey.

844
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:09,816
Yuri, there are men
going through our garbage cans.

845
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,070
It's probably just some reporters
looking for somebody else.

846
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,948
I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

847
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:19,826
Yuri,

848
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,955
is there anything
I should be worried about?

849
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,083
No, nothing.

850
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,294
- Nothing.
- I love you.

851
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,130
I love you, too.

852
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:37,927
Sir.

853
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,394
I was now the best merchant of death alive.

854
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,772
I didn't own my own plane. I owned a fleet.

855
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,944
Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.

856
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,363
Most trips, I had phony paperwork.

857
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,032
If the deadline was tight
and I had to cut corners,

858
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,034
I had no paperwork at all.

859
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,247
But I wasn't overly concerned.

860
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,541
There was hardly any radar
over most of Africa,

861
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,251
and even fewer people to watch it.

862
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,550
Charlie, Echo, India.

863
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,720
Reroute to Kabala airport on heading 0-2-9.

864
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,222
Comply immediately.

865
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,697
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.
I'm sorry to call you on this number,

866
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,407
but I've got Interpol all over my ass.

867
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:26,077
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good time.

868
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,581
Not a good time?

869
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:43,052
Charlie, Echo, India, comply immediately.
This is your last warning.

870
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,470
Where was the first fucking warning?

871
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,389
Rock your wings if you intend to comply.

872
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,932
I'm putting us down.

873
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,523
If you land, we're all going away.
I don't have paperwork.

874
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,568
- We're in a flying fucking bomb.
- They're firing bullets at our bullets.

875
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,197
- I'm putting us down.
- Okay, okay, fuck!

876
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,782
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

877
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,244
Request reroute to Kabala airport
on bearing 0-2-9.

878
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:12,540
No, not the airport.
There, the highway. It's our only hope.

879
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,710
Are you fucking mad?
A pothole will set us off.

880
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,004
You underestimate yourself, Aleksei.

881
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,798
You're the best. You're the shit, Aleksei.
You're the shit!

882
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,051
You're the shit! You're the shit!

883
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,845
Of course, Aleksei wasn't the best.

884
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,390
He'd come 42nd out of 43
at the Moscow Flight School.

885
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,234
Oh, God, what's he doing?

886
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,444
Is this guy nuts?

887
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:44,989
I can't land there, sir.

888
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,825
Kabala's only 15 minutes away.
He can't get far.

889
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,119
I want a truck on the tarmac.

890
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,489
We're gonna be okay.

891
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,411
- Where you going?
- As far from the evidence as we can get.

892
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,580
Wait! There's not gonna be any evidence.

893
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,097
Come here, come here.

894
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,145
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look. Free sample.

895
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,106
Help yourself, okay? Free sample.
Tell your friends.

896
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:46,319
Come here. You want something? Look.
Want an RPG? All for you, all right?

897
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:50,406
Happy times. Come on. Help yourselves!
No charge. Everything goes.

898
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,451
Guns, guns, guns. Yeah, come on up!

899
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,453
Here, having fun now, huh?

900
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:01,042
Come on. Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!

901
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,711
Bullets, guns, grenades.

902
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,839
Hooray, yeah, take them all.
Take the whole crate.

903
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,675
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

904
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,222
Guns, grenades, hooray!

905
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,933
Bullets, guns, grenades!

906
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,268
Yeah!

907
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,937
That one's got your name on it.

908
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:23,564
You want one, too? Come on.
We got bullets.

909
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,400
Don't forget the bullets.

910
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,069
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

911
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,154
Everything goes for free.

912
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,366
Guns, grenades, RPGs,

913
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,827
bullets, guns, yeah!

914
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,996
Hooray, hooray! Want some bullets?

915
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,082
Gotta have bullets.

916
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,419
What a cargo crew
at Heathrow Airport does in a day,

917
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,381
took a bunch of malnourished
Sierra Leonean locals 10 minutes.

918
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,009
By the time Agent Valentine got there,

919
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,804
you could find more guns
on a plane full of Quakers.

920
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,521
Yuri Orlov.

921
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,858
- Fuck!
- You run from us?

922
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,026
No, Mbizi, no.

923
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,862
Can he run with no legs?

924
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,283
Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine.
Around here, people disappear all the time.

925
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,451
I can't do that.

926
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,536
Look where we are. Who will know?

927
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,874
We will.

928
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,716
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

929
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,967
I'm not as certain.

930
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,436
All right, get up.

931
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,735
- What's the charge?
- What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

932
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,987
- I'm on safari.
- Yeah?

933
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,699
You're hunting wildebeests
with a submachine gun?

934
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,743
Do you also work with the Park Service?

935
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,912
Hunting without a license.
Is that the charge?

936
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,582
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

937
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,709
- Trade.
- Trade, traffic.

938
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:08,920
You get rich

939
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,132
by giving the poorest people on the planet
the means to continue killing each other.

940
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,926
Do you know why I do what I do?

941
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,720
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

942
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,639
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals.

943
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:23,100
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

944
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,311
No, nine out of 10 war victims today

945
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:28,940
are killed with assault rifles
and small arms like yours.

946
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,108
Those nuclear missiles,
they sit in their silos.

947
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,946
Your AK-47,
that is the real weapon of mass destruction.

948
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:38,449
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

949
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,827
I don't put a gun to anybody's head
and make them shoot.

950
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,539
I admit,
a shooting war's better for business,

951
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,999
but I prefer people to fire my guns
and miss,

952
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,834
just as long as they're firing.

953
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,055
Can I go now? You've got nothing on me.

954
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,474
Except cuffs.

955
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,480
Since you're so concerned with the law,
you must know

956
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:13,651
that I'm legally permitted to hold you
for 24 hours without charging you.

957
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,280
You might ask why I would do that,
and I can assure you

958
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,533
it's not because I enjoy your company,
because I don't. No.

959
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:25,538
The reason why I will delay you for
every second of the permissible 24 hours is

960
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,834
I am delaying your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

961
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:33,754
I don't think of it as taking a day from you,
but giving a day to them.

962
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:38,426
Some innocent man, woman or child
is going to have an extra day on this Earth

963
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,177
because you're not free.

964
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,848
So, I will see you

965
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,517
in 23 hours

966
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,686
and 55 minutes.

967
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,571
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.
There was nowhere to go.

968
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:02,366
Or maybe he was hoping
the locals would tear me apart.

969
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,202
But they were too busy with the plane.

970
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:11,334
It's like parking your car
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

971
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,461
You just don't do it.

972
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,808
The way I look at it, it's the way of Africa.

973
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,560
Maybe life.

974
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,564
Everything that comes from the earth
eventually returns.

975
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:36,859
Even a 40-ton Antonov-12 cargo plane.

976
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,211
A gift for you.

977
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,924
You know, you've arrived just in time.

978
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,720
I was afraid that he might die
before you got your chance

979
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,514
to kill him.

980
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,147
This man came here

981
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,859
hoping to take your place.

982
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,488
Is that not so?

983
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,711
No, I'm not here to supply Mr. Baptiste.

984
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,132
I am here to supply his enemies.

985
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,430
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

986
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,268
He killed your blood,

987
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,979
your uncle,

988
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,607
when he tried to kill you.

989
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,701
- No.
- No?

990
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,123
You want that I should let him go?

991
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,837
- No, I...
- "No, no, I... "

992
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,383
You do want him dead.

993
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,718
You just

994
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,680
don't want to have to do it yourself.

995
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,354
So,

996
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,899
we will do this together.

997
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,948
This will be

998
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,743
a bonding experience.

999
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,627
You know you can stop this
anytime that you want.

1000
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,754
But I don't think that you do.

1001
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,548
Just say the word.

1002
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,760
Say "stop. "

1003
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,775
Stop.

1004
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,329
I will get you another room, my friend.

1005
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,332
With a much nicer view.

1006
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,743
He ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.

1007
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:01,790
- What?
- Brown-brown.

1008
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,668
- What is it?
- It's a mixture of cocaine

1009
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:07,796
and gunpowder.

1010
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,175
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

1011
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:12,801
They do anything.

1012
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,347
Some other time.

1013
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:19,892
I suggest you try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1014
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,019
Why?

1015
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,980
Because it's your gunpowder.

1016
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:42,206
All right.

1017
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,963
Even before that night

1018
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,799
I started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.

1019
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,718
I'd never tried brown-brown before.

1020
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,054
But then I never killed a man, either.

1021
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,726
Here we go. Come on!

1022
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,081
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1023
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:34,341
Wait, are you sick? SIDA?

1024
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,343
AIDS?

1025
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:40,681
Ask the white man. He will know.

1026
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,475
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1027
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,903
- Simeon?
- Remember, Yuri.

1028
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,239
Take sides.

1029
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,744
Simeon!

1030
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,749
Don't! He's Andre's.

1031
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,877
- Fuck Andre.
- Yeah, fuck Andre.

1032
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,257
I'm sorry, they don't usually do that.

1033
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,887
Well, let me look at it. Maybe I can fix it.

1034
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,681
Let me see it. It's the magazine.
Give it to me.

1035
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,726
Fuck you!

1036
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,837
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1037
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,423
The curse of invincibility.

1038
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,679
Nicki, please go to your room.

1039
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,477
I don't believe you.

1040
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,313
Can you prove any of this?

1041
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:16,693
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble
to make his business look legitimate.

1042
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:20,197
Even to you. Perhaps, especially to you.

1043
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,742
I don't expect
we're gonna find anything here today.

1044
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,661
So, what do you want?

1045
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,873
I was hoping that you would help me.

1046
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,007
I understand that

1047
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:42,553
your parents died tragically.

1048
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,102
The illegal firearms
used to murder your mother and father

1049
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:53,272
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

1050
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:57,609
I'd like you to leave.

1051
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,865
Okay. Gentlemen.

1052
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:19,798
Ava?

1053
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,934
Ava, what's wrong?

1054
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,146
I can't wear the clothes.

1055
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:37,232
I can't wear the jewelry.

1056
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:40,611
Can't drive the car.

1057
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,698
Can't live in this house.

1058
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:46,950
Everything's got blood on it.

1059
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,452
Blood on it?

1060
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:52,581
What's the matter with you?

1061
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,462
Don't be so melodramatic.

1062
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:01,965
Of course I'm melodramatic.
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1063
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,560
I told you, these people, it's political.

1064
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,520
They lie. They're liars.

1065
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:18,815
Look at me. Look. They lie
to make themselves look good, okay?

1066
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,985
- You can't trust them.
- It's not just them.

1067
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:28,158
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

1068
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,577
They didn't have to.

1069
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:37,000
I sell people a means
to defend themselves, Ava.

1070
01:27:37,168 --> 01:27:38,168
That's all.

1071
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,546
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1072
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:43,590
The guns are bigger than the boys.

1073
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,510
There is nothing illegal about what I do!

1074
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:48,345
I don't care if it's legal!

1075
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,180
It's wrong!

1076
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:11,702
Please stop.

1077
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,915
It makes no difference if I stop.

1078
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,085
Someone will take my place the next day.

1079
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:23,046
So let them. We have enough.

1080
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,550
It's not about the money.

1081
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,053
Then what is it?

1082
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:35,934
I'm good at it.

1083
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,573
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

1084
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,783
I mean,

1085
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,162
all I've done is be born.

1086
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:59,750
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1087
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,544
I'm not much good as a mother.

1088
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:08,300
Come to think of it,
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1089
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,890
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1090
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,603
But I won't fail as a human being.

1091
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,111
My enemies had finally found a weapon
that could hurt me.

1092
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:32,949
For the next six months I stopped
running guns. I went legitimate.

1093
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,701
This is an untapped market.

1094
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:38,789
I'm talking over five million cubic meters
of timber in the first year alone.

1095
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:40,999
Over 100 exploitable species.

1096
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,585
The oil? Between you and me,
this is the new Texas.

1097
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:46,338
What do you say to 10,000 barrels a month?

1098
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,382
He must be lying.

1099
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:50,675
He's talking.

1100
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,137
Listen, there are gas reserves off the
Ivory Coast that OPEC doesn't know about.

1101
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,223
The phone numbers all check out.

1102
01:29:58,267 --> 01:29:59,810
It's all on the level.

1103
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:02,896
No wonder Valentine was confused.

1104
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:21,331
Thank God there are still legal ways
to exploit developing countries.

1105
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,335
But the only problem with an honest buck
is they're so hard to make.

1106
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,797
The margins are too low.
Too many people are doing it.

1107
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,887
Still, I'd promised Ava.

1108
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:47,774
Yuri, the President of Liberia
is on his way up.

1109
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,278
He's early.

1110
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,781
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

1111
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,206
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1112
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,208
We are here for peace talks
at the United Nations.

1113
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,878
So at the same time you thought
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1114
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,381
Well, I was beginning to wonder
whether that was still your profession.

1115
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:13,925
You know you're a hard man
to get ahold of all of a sudden.

1116
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,261
That is a shame.

1117
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:19,806
My son and I,
we were hoping to do a little shopping

1118
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,726
- while we are here in New York.
- You know they're watching you.

1119
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,603
Yes, I know they blame me.

1120
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,189
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1121
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,150
- They're on a hunt for a witch.
- Witch-hunt.

1122
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:32,444
Hostilities have escalated.

1123
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:36,114
They are making it very difficult
for me to re-supply.

1124
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:41,077
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1125
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:45,582
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

1126
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,257
I understand.

1127
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,928
But you should know this.

1128
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,764
Due to our present situation
we are compelled

1129
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,475
to be unusually generous.

1130
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,398
So see you soon,

1131
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:12,943
Lord of War.

1132
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,658
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1133
01:32:36,467 --> 01:32:41,179
At four and a half months old
a human fetus has a reptile's tail,

1134
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:43,306
a remnant of our evolution.

1135
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:45,517
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1136
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:47,894
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive.

1137
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:51,064
But if you fight your biology
you will always lose.

1138
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:54,442
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for another 10 minutes.

1139
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,987
- Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
- Oh, okay.

1140
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:59,364
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1141
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:02,284
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1142
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,536
This oil concession
should be wrapped up by Thursday.

1143
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,955
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere.

1144
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:09,165
- The sea.
- That would be fun.

1145
01:33:10,334 --> 01:33:11,835
- Come on.
- Hey.

1146
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,504
You trust me, right?

1147
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:17,924
She looked me directly in the eye

1148
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,802
the way I've looked in the eyes
of a thousand customs officials,

1149
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,430
government bureaucrats
and law enforcement agents.

1150
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:25,682
Yes, I trust you.

1151
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,934
And she lied without flinching.

1152
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:31,396
- I'll see you, big guy.
- Bye, Papa.

1153
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,773
She learned from the best.

1154
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,317
Have a good trip.

1155
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:53,543
That's him.

1156
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:17,150
- Where are we going, Mama?
- It's a game, honey.

1157
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:19,069
Like hide and seek?

1158
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,820
Yes.

1159
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,240
Like hide and seek.

1160
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:48,848
I can always sense when I'm being tailed.
I know what to look for.

1161
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:51,810
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

1162
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,616
I can put myself in Ava's place.

1163
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:09,828
She might have understood
if the combination was the last four digits

1164
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:12,706
of my social security number,
my birthday, even her birthday.

1165
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,290
But not Nicolai's.

1166
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,476
My son's birthday unlocked
what the government would later describe

1167
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,311
as "a catalog of carnage. "

1168
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,313
Honey, come over here.

1169
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,532
Nicki, stay right here.

1170
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,305
Come on, Nicki.

1171
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:08,947
- Come to see how the other half lives?
- I miss your borscht.

1172
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:11,741
- Mom and Dad say you're clean.
- Yeah, you, too.

1173
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:16,538
You went legit, huh? That's hard to believe.

1174
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,998
That's because it's not true.

1175
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:23,837
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job.

1176
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,421
I want you to come.

1177
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:27,966
I can't.

1178
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,429
I've got a girlfriend.
I think she might be the one.

1179
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:37,183
Plus I'm thinking of opening my own place.

1180
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:40,311
Maybe this trip will help. It's good money.

1181
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:44,440
Yuri,

1182
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:47,402
I've given my word.

1183
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:51,322
No one has to know.
We'll tell them we're going for a little R&R.

1184
01:37:54,743 --> 01:37:56,578
What do you need me for all of a sudden?

1185
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,329
West Africa's fucked up.

1186
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,456
More than usual.

1187
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,959
I can't trust anybody.

1188
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,256
I need you to watch my back.

1189
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,171
Yuri.

1190
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:51,966
Welcome back.

1191
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,178
Welcome, both of you.

1192
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:57,138
Welcome to democracy.

1193
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,390
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1194
01:38:59,975 --> 01:39:01,768
You have not seen the news.

1195
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:04,270
You know,
they accuse me of rigging elections.

1196
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,480
But after this,

1197
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:08,858
with your Florida
and your Supreme Court of kangaroos,

1198
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,945
now the US must shut up forever.

1199
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,868
How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

1200
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:24,082
How do you do this
when they are watching all of my airspace?

1201
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,210
Where there's a will there's a weapon.

1202
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,380
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1203
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,177
When it is delivered.

1204
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,765
- It is delivered.
- This is not for me.

1205
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,351
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1206
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:44,727
The west?

1207
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:47,689
We're going to Sierra Leone.

1208
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,941
Oh, yes. And my son,

1209
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:53,903
Baptiste Jr. will go with you
to make the proper introductions.

1210
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,822
We have no trucks.

1211
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:00,910
You will,
as soon as we get the food out of them.

1212
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,750
The gun of Rambo.

1213
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,004
Mr. Yuri, you are a man of your word.

1214
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,047
So, where are we going?

1215
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:16,884
RUF. The Freedom Fighters.

1216
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:21,472
Every faction in Africa
calls themselves by these noble names.

1217
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,599
Liberation-this, Patriotic-that,

1218
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,893
Democratic Republic of something-or-other.

1219
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:29,647
Yeah!

1220
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,358
I guess they can't own up
to what they usually are,

1221
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,987
Federation of Worse Oppressors
Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

1222
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:44,912
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1223
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:48,207
when both combatants
proclaim themselves freedom fighters.

1224
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:57,425
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new

1225
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,469
right out of the box all as clean as this.

1226
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:01,012
What have you got?

1227
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,698
God! Oh, Jesus.

1228
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,662
Oh, Jesus.

1229
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:32,251
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1230
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,337
- Not now.
- Now.

1231
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:37,840
Excuse me.

1232
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:46,599
What?

1233
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:50,186
- We can't do this deal.
- The fuck we can't.

1234
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:53,689
- What's the matter with you?
- Look. Look over there.

1235
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:56,776
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die.

1236
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,404
It's not our business.

1237
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,075
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1238
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:12,875
- What is the hold-up?
- There is no hold-up. I'll be right there.

1239
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,295
Vitaly, it's what we always know.
We can't control what they do.

1240
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,965
No, no, today we can.

1241
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,967
Today we can. Yuri, they're right there!

1242
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:24,178
What do you think they'll do to us
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1243
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,556
And if we go ahead,
what do you think they'll do to them?

1244
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,771
We got to do something.

1245
01:42:42,072 --> 01:42:43,573
What is he saying?

1246
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,741
It's the deal.

1247
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:49,453
My brother's not happy with the terms,
but we're working it out. It's nothing.

1248
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,881
Right? It's nothing.

1249
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:09,265
Yeah, nothing.

1250
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:13,519
You're right, Yuri. You're right.

1251
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:16,856
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1252
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:20,735
- This is not our fight.
- Right.

1253
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:24,155
Okay, what's the deal? 300 RPGs,

1254
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:27,950
500 assault rifles and 800 grenades.

1255
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:32,705
I thought it was 1,200 grenades.

1256
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:37,501
I was so caught up in the deal

1257
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:40,129
I never realized what was going on
in Vitaly's head.

1258
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:43,674
I thought it was 1,200 grenades. Confused.

1259
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,051
Come to think about it,

1260
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:48,304
maybe I never understood
what was going on in his head.

1261
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:55,269
I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

1262
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,064
One thing I do understand for certain

1263
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:01,400
is that Vitaly broke the cardinal rule
of gunrunning.

1264
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:04,862
Never pick up a gun
and join the customers.

1265
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:13,704
What are you doing?

1266
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:18,960
Something for Yuri.

1267
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,505
Step away. Slow.

1268
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:46,320
No, Vit!

1269
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:16,702
Only half the guns were gone
so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.

1270
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:19,455
If I took them, I was lost.

1271
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,832
If I left them, I was lost.

1272
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:33,803
The massacre played out
exactly how Vitaly predicted.

1273
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:38,182
But then a half dozen other massacres
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1274
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:39,975
You can't stop them all.

1275
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,853
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

1276
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:48,317
They say,
"Evil prevails when good men fail to act. "

1277
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:52,238
What they ought to say is, "Evil prevails. "

1278
01:47:06,336 --> 01:47:08,254
I now shared even more in common

1279
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:11,674
with the leader of that country
God seemed to have forsaken.

1280
01:47:11,716 --> 01:47:14,802
We saw something in each other
neither one of us liked.

1281
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:17,304
Or maybe,
we were just looking in the mirror.

1282
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:41,954
I'd paid a Monrovian doctor $20
to remove the lead from Vitaly's body

1283
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:44,206
and write a bogus death certificate.

1284
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:46,792
I should have paid more.

1285
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,128
I've smuggled millions of rounds
of ammunition,

1286
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:53,299
and the bullet that lands me in jail
is found under my dead brother's rib.

1287
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:56,677
Yuri Orlov.

1288
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:00,222
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

1289
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:03,309
Let me guess.
This isn't about the alcohol or the tobacco.

1290
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:48,062
- Crimean Restaurant.
- Papa?

1291
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,488
Both my sons are dead.

1292
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,285
There are only two tragedies in life.

1293
01:49:03,828 --> 01:49:07,331
One is not getting what you want.
The other is getting it.

1294
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:08,749
Is this one of yours?

1295
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:11,627
Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.

1296
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:16,048
Curiously, the death certificate
says he died of heart failure.

1297
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:18,884
Falsifying a death certificate?

1298
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:21,053
That's not going to hold me.

1299
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:25,099
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1300
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,812
Have you seen today's paper?

1301
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,154
Fake end-user certificates.

1302
01:49:39,197 --> 01:49:41,657
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1303
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:46,036
There is hardly a warlord,
dictator or despot

1304
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:49,164
anywhere in the world that you're not
on a first-name basis with.

1305
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,750
It was your wife, your trophy-wife,

1306
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:54,420
that led us to the prize.

1307
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:57,506
It's not her fault.
She's just easier to follow than you are.

1308
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,051
May I?

1309
01:50:01,761 --> 01:50:03,304
Yeah, go ahead.

1310
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:29,204
Enjoy it.

1311
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:31,707
- What?
- This.

1312
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:37,004
Tell me I'm everything you despise.
That I'm the personification of evil.

1313
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:38,881
That I'm, what,

1314
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:43,052
responsible for the breakdown
of the fabric of society and world order.

1315
01:50:43,678 --> 01:50:45,554
I'm a one-man genocide.

1316
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:50,517
Say everything you want to say to me now.
'Cause you don't have long.

1317
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:52,978
Are you paying attention?

1318
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,856
Or are you delusional?

1319
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:59,777
You have broken
every arms embargo written.

1320
01:50:59,986 --> 01:51:01,570
There is enough evidence here

1321
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,406
to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

1322
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:06,450
You are going to spend
the next 10 years of your life

1323
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:10,954
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start serving your time.

1324
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,920
I don't think you fully appreciate
the seriousness of your situation.

1325
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:30,432
My family has disowned me.

1326
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:34,770
My wife and son have left me.

1327
01:51:38,274 --> 01:51:39,942
My brother's dead.

1328
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:45,447
Trust me, I fully appreciate
the seriousness of my situation.

1329
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,783
But I promise you,

1330
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:50,786
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1331
01:51:52,288 --> 01:51:53,831
You are delusional.

1332
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,041
I like you, Jack.

1333
01:51:56,918 --> 01:52:00,045
Well, maybe not, but I understand you.

1334
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:06,301
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1335
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:09,888
This way you can prepare yourself.

1336
01:52:14,477 --> 01:52:15,602
Okay.

1337
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:18,981
Soon there's gonna be a knock
on that door and you will be called outside.

1338
01:52:19,065 --> 01:52:21,608
In the hall
there will be a man who outranks you.

1339
01:52:21,651 --> 01:52:24,820
First, he'll compliment you
on the fine job you've done,

1340
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:27,239
that you're making the world a safer place,

1341
01:52:27,323 --> 01:52:30,784
that you're to receive a commendation
and a promotion.

1342
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:34,538
And then he's going to tell you
that I am to be released.

1343
01:52:34,622 --> 01:52:36,331
You're going to protest.

1344
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,501
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1345
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:42,504
But in the end I will be released.

1346
01:52:43,339 --> 01:52:44,506
The reason I'll be released

1347
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,384
is the same reason
you think I'll be convicted.

1348
01:52:47,969 --> 01:52:50,888
I do rub shoulders
with some of the most vile,

1349
01:52:50,972 --> 01:52:53,849
sadistic men
calling themselves leaders today.

1350
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,102
But some of those men

1351
01:52:58,396 --> 01:53:00,981
are the enemies of your enemies.

1352
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:06,069
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss,

1353
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:08,822
the President of the United States,

1354
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:12,201
who ships more merchandise in a day
than I do in a year,

1355
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:17,539
sometimes it's embarrassing
to have his fingerprints on the guns.

1356
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:21,126
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1357
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:24,087
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.

1358
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:25,714
So,

1359
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:29,676
you call me evil.

1360
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:35,182
But unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

1361
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:53,909
I would tell you to go to hell,

1362
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,120
but I think you're already there.

1363
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:33,949
Pleasure doing business with you.

1364
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:36,910
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

1365
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:39,162
I expect to be paid to leave.

1366
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:40,831
I'm not a fool.

1367
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:43,000
I know that just because
they needed me that day

1368
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:45,836
didn't mean they wouldn't make me
a scapegoat the next.

1369
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,464
But I was back doing what I do best.

1370
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:14,823
You know who's going to inherit the Earth?

1371
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,283
Arms dealers.

1372
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:19,494
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1373
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:21,872
That's the secret to survival.

1374
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,832
Never go to war.

1375
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:29,004
Especially with yourself.
