Why don't you go see
if they could use some help.

162

They got all the men they need.

163
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,145
Why don't you just go
and make sure.

Do you leave the light on

193
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,568
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

194
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,654
The corridor?

195
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,657

I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

199

Dean, take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

200
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,851
- Yes, sir.
- Of course they're broken.

201
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,728
I heard the bones crack.

when we brought the dummy in?

It is.

256

Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

257
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,734
but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

258

and his name is Percy Wetmore.

259
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,947
Little Percy calls his aunt...

260
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,659
and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

261
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,373
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

262
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,334
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

263
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,170
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

264
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,256
The man is mean and careless
and stupid...

265
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,342
and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

266
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,011
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

267
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,555
Stick with it, Paul.

It may not be much longer.

has an application in at Briar Ridge.

270
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,022
Briar Ridge?
The mental hospital.

271
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,566

Better pay.

Hmm.

274
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,988
Then why is he still here?

275
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,200
He could get that application
pushed through.

276
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,706
Hell, with his connections, he could
have any state job he wants.

277
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,167
You know what I think?

278
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,755
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

279
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,721
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Wort he?

280
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,726
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

281
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,229
- you'll keep the peace?
- Of course.

775
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,684
Which client?

776
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,938
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

777
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,524
- John Coffey.
- Ah.

778
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,109
Coffey.

779
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,485
He causing you problems?

780
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:03,531
No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

781
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,617
but other than that...

782
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:09,078
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

783
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,830
You know what he did.

784
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,541
I read the court transcript.

785
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,212
- Thank you, missus.
- My pleasure.

786
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,382
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

<font color="#804040">TOGETHER</font>: Coming, Mama!

788
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,262
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

789
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,182
I've wondered if he did anything
like that before.

790
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,644
Why?
Has he said anything?

791
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,980
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

792
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,109
has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

793
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,197
that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

794
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,785
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

795
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,996
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

796
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,332
Believe me, we tried.

797
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,335
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

798
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,587
How can that be?

799
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:04,008
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

800
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:08,263
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

801
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,641
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

802
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,727
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

803
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,188
He is...

804
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,565
strange, I admit.

805
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,237
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

806
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,115
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

807
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,201
I deal with them day in and day out.

808
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,663
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

809
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,791
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

810
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,877
Do you?

811
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,256
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

812
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,550
He was found with the
victims in his arms.

813
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,552
And yet you defended him.

814
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,139
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

820
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,491
We had us a dog.

821
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,702
Just a sweet mongrel.

822
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,412
You know the kind.

823
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,208
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

824
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,836
You get to know it.

825
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,424
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

826
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:30,136
but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

827

If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

828
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,062
My wife and I were not so lucky.

829
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,565
Caleb, come here for a second.

830
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,151
Come here.

831
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,862
Please, son.

832
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,949
He still has the one good eye.

833
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,578
I suppose he's lucky...

834
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,122
not to be completely blind.

835
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:04,629
We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least.

836
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,672
Right, Caleb?

837
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,468
Okay, go on in now.

838
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,808
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

839
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,644
Just got it in his mind one day.

840
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,854
The same with John Coffey.

841
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,317
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

842
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,820
But those little girls...

843
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,489
stayed raped and murdered.

844
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,158
Maybe he'd never done it before.

845
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,079
My dog never bit before.

846
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,542
But I didn't concern myself with that.

847
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,505
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

848
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,049
Is Coffey guilty?

849
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,720
Yes, he is.

850
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,014
Don't you doubt it.

851
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,851
And don't you turn your back on him.

852
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,856
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

853
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,358
but in the end...

854
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,820

01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:28,292
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1240
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:40,012
What in the blue fuck was that?

Jesus Christ.

1242
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,559
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1243
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,520
And the smell.

1244
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:52,107
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for five years.

1245
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:53,943
That's what I'm betting.

1246
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:58,239
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1247
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,115
You can hear him up there!

1248
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,201
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

Now, what in the hell happened?

1252
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,930
An execution. A successful one.

1253

How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1254
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,813
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

something to say?

I didn't know the sponge

pissing on a toilet seat...

Pure and simple.

That's your official position?

Don't you think it should be?

1264
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:07,182
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

Moving on to bigger and better things.

01:51:21,966 --> 01:51:23,550
You could hear it.

He did the same thing to me.

He put his hands on me.

He took my bladder infection away.

You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1360
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:33,462

they're all married now.

1371

Brutal's a single man.

1372
01:58:06,662 --> 01:58:09,998
You're the only one here with
two children, another one on the way.

1373
01:58:10,374 --> 01:58:13,460
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1374
01:58:15,671 --> 01:58:18,381
Brutal, help me out here.

1375
01:58:19,675 --> 01:58:23,178
- I'm sure she's a fine woman.
- The finest.

1376
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:25,680
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1377
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:28,350
to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1378
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,685
I have no doubt.

1379
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,688
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1380
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:37,025
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1381
01:58:38,152 --> 01:58:40,362
Now, what if he escapes?

1382
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:43,698
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1383
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:47,202
but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1384
01:58:47,453 --> 01:58:49,538
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1385
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,290
In fact...

1386
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:56,711
I don't think he did it at all.

1387
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:03,635
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1388
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:05,929
in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1389
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:10,559
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1390
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:13,562
And plus...

1391
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,022
he's huge.

1392
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:20,861
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1393
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:25,240
We'd all have shotguns,

of they hair, and they's just fine.

Well, feel how we feel, then.

As for me...

1926

John had to give me
a part of himself...

a gift, the way he saw it...

that worked through him...
