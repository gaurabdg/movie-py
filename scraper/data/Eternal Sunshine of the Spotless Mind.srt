1
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:35,273
Montauk train on track B.

2
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:39,685
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.

3
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,025
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies...

4
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,027
Last call...

5
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:48,586
to make people feel like crap.

6
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,258
I ditched work today.

7
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,195
Took a train out to Montauk.

8
00:01:57,272 --> 00:01:59,272
Montauk train boarding on track B.

9
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,136
I don't know why.

10
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,374
I'm not an impulsive person.

11
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,752
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

12
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,158
I gotta get my car fixed.

13
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:21,162
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,664
It's Joel. Joel!

15
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:27,692
Listen, I don't feel very well today.

16
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,704
No, food poisoning, I think.

17
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:33,264
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

18
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,902
Montauk in February. Brilliant, Joel.

19
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,615
Page is ripped out.

20
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:43,208
Don't remember doing that.

21
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,312
It appears this is my first entry in two years.

22
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,124
Sand is overrated.

23
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,327
It's just tiny little rocks.

24
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,639
If only I could meet someone new.

25
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:18,586
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished,

26
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:23,250
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.

27
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,523
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.

28
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:30,897
She was nice. Nice is good.

29
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,869
She loved me.

30
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,974
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see...

31
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:17,911
who shows me the least bit of attention?

32
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,687
Hi.

33
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:01,990
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:05,721
- I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,454
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,033
How far are you going?

37
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:14,890
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,235
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:20,241
- Really? - What are the odds?

40
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:24,469
Do I know you?

41
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,216
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,412
- Sure. Sure. - That's it!

43
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,853
- Yeah? - I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,087
Book slave there for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,527
- Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. - Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,690
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,893
- What might? - It changes a lot.

48
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:49,267
The color. That's why you might not recognize me.

49
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:53,001
- It's called Blue Ruin, the color. - Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,407
- Snappy name, huh? - I like it.

51
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:57,878
Yeah.

52
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,041
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:05,577
Red... Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

54
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:08,589
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.

55
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,592
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,187
I mean, how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.

57
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,289
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:21,604
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.

59
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:25,372
I apply my personality in a paste.

60
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,375
Oh, I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,734
Well, you don't know me, so...

62
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:33,138
you don't know, do you?

63
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:39,386
Sorry. I was just... I'm trying to be nice.

64
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:43,214
Yeah. I got it.

65
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:05,713
- My name's Clementine, by the way. - I'm Joel.

66
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:08,613
- Hi, Joel. - Hey.

67
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,684
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:14,085
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice.

69
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:18,085
I don't know any jokes about your name.

70
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,321
Huckleberry Hound.

71
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,956
I don't know what that means.

72
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:26,160
Huckleberry Hound? What are you, nuts?

73
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,169
It's been suggested.

74
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:31,390
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine

75
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:34,248
You were lost and gone forever

76
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,589
Dreadful sorry Clementine

77
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,140
No?

78
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,116
I'm sorry. Just... It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice.

79
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,175
It's, uh... It means "merciful".

80
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,187
Right? Clemency?

81
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:48,450
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:50,822
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

83
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,327
Gee, I-I wouldn't think that about you.

84
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,592
- Why wouldn't you think that about me? - I don't know.

85
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,895
I just...

86
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,300
I don't know. I just, uh...

87
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,304
You seem nice, so...

88
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,397
Oh, now I'm nice?

89
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:08,637
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?

90
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,645
I don't need "nice".

91
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:14,706
- I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me. - Okay.

92
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,544
Joel?

93
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,886
It's Joel, right?

94
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,392
Yes.

95
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,895
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

96
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,455
I'm a little out of sorts today.

97
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,043
My embarrassing admission is,

98
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,046
I really like that you're nice right now.

99
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:49,949
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like,

100
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,010
but right now...

101
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,146
I'm glad you are.

102
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:06,528
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh...

103
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,699
- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. - I-I'm writing, and...

104
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,866
- No, no. I just... - Sure. No. That's okay.

105
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,536
- I just have... You know, this is... - Okay.

106
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:18,011
- Ohh! Hey! - Take care, then.

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,071
Jesus!

108
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:37,328
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.

109
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,333
It's cold.

110
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,301
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. - Yeah?

111
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,270
It is frosty.

112
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,137
- You're not a stalker or anything, right? - I'm not a stalker.

113
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,301
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

114
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,641
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.

115
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,840
Really? There's a stalker book?

116
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,110
- Mm-hmm. - Okay.

117
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,516
I gotta read that one.

118
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:06,683
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

119
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:10,157
Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were.

120
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:18,862
Did you wanna have a drink?

121
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,129
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um...

122
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,137
Um...

123
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,139
Never mind.

124
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,573
- Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. - No, no, no, no.

125
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,634
Good night, Joel.

126
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,222
Two Blue Ruins.

127
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,031
Thank you.

128
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,037
Drink up, young man.

129
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,903
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

130
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,145
I'm just kidding!

131
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,204
Come on.

132
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,146
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren't you?

133
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,157
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:20,719
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.

135
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,393
I go to work, I come home.

136
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,968
Don't know what to say.

137
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,971
You should read my journal.

138
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,533
I mean, it's just... blank.

139
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,841
Really? Does that make you sad or anxious?

140
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,246
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest,

141
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,251
taking advantage of every possibility,

142
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:47,255
making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

143
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,814
- I think about that. - Yeah?

144
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,197
You're really nice.

145
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:59,098
- Ohh! - God, I have to stop saying that.

146
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,305
I'm gonna marry you.

147
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,306
I know it.

148
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,535
Um... okay.

149
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:17,214
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

150
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,220
It gets frozen this time of year.

151
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,449
- That sounds scary. - Exactly.

152
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,459
I'll pack a picnic.

153
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:27,428
A night picnic. Night picnics are different.

154
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,327
And, um, we could...

155
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,332
Sounds good.

156
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:34,995
But I... I should, uh, go. Now.

157
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,004
You should stay.

158
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,302
No, I really... I'm... I...

159
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,309
I have to get up so early.

160
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,311
I would like you to call me.

161
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,143
Would you do that? I would like it.

162
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,206
Yes.

163
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:54,485
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call!

164
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,422
That'd be nice.

165
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,133
What took you so long?

166
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,135
I just walked in.

167
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,797
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

168
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:46,103
Yeah. Oddly enough, I do.

169
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,109
Oh!

170
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:51,112
You said "I do". I guess that means were married.

171
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,114
I guess so.

172
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,650
Tomorrow night? Honeymoon on ice?

173
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,152
It's really solid this time of year.

174
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,085
Whoa! I don't know.

175
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,089
- Come on. Come on. - Eee!

176
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:04,091
Come on. Come on, come on.

177
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,595
Whew.

178
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:11,155
Oh. So beautiful.

179
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,335
Isn't it?

180
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,340
Uh, don't go too far.

181
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,172
- Whoo! Oww! Ow! - Whoa! Oh!

182
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:25,441
- Are you okay? - Ouch! Fuck it.

183
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,211
Ohh! Oh, my ass!

184
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,222
- I think I should go back. - Come on. Come on!

185
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,224
What if it breaks?

186
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,227
- "What if"? Do you really care right now? - Huh?

187
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,456
Come here. Please.

188
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,259
Come on.

189
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,569
- Ohh. - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

190
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,572
- Slidy-slidy. Slidy-slidy. - Whoa!

191
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,905
- This is good. - Here, let me show you this one thing.

192
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,070
What are you doing? Whoa.

193
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:00,481
Come on.

194
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,389
Think I heard a crack.

195
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:12,223
It's not gonna crack or break or...

196
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,285
It's so thick.

197
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,559
Show me which constellations you know.

198
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:21,228
Um... Oh.

199
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,965
I don't... know any.

200
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,671
Show me which ones you know.

201
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,806
Okay.

202
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,339
Oh. Here's Osidius.

203
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,352
Where?

204
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,354
Right there. See?

205
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:43,220
Sort of a swoop and a cross.

206
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,226
Osidius the Emphatic.

207
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,662
- You're full of shit. Right? - Nope.

208
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,667
Osidius is right there. Swoop and cross.

209
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,795
Shut the fuck up!

210
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,883
Clementine.

211
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,181
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

212
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,723
- Hey. - Hey.

213
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,851
- Hey. - Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.

214
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:23,021
Ahh.

215
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,962
Can I come over to your house...

216
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,702
to sleep?

217
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:36,643
I'm so tired.

218
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,510
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

219
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,482
- Let me get my toothbrush. - Yeah. Oh.

220
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,811
Just...

221
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,329
Yes?

222
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,844
- Can I help you? - What do you mean?

223
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:13,348
Can I help you with something?

224
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,043
No.

225
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,416
What are you doing here?

226
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,012
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.

227
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,751
Oh.

228
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,750
Thanks.

229
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:43,384
I need your lovin'

230
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,220
Like the sunshine

231
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:57,995
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

232
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:05,323
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

233
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:12,449
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

234
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,902
- We're looking for 159. - What number's that?

235
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,906
I don't know where that is.

236
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:21,909
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light the number, or at least put a number on...

237
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,911
- Is that him? - I think so.

238
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:27,073
Yeah, that's him. Wait. That's him.

239
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,355
- Hey, Joel. - Frank.

240
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,262
Oh, shit.

241
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:53,775
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day cards I get are from my mother.

242
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,776
How pathetic is that, huh?

243
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,778
You're lucky you have Clementine, man.

244
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,780
She is way cool.

245
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,339
Hey, you got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?

246
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,154
No.

247
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,157
Well, it's only a day away. Better make some reservations or something.

248
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,352
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's. Right?

249
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,362
McRomance!

250
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,864
You want some fries with that shake?

251
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,264
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.

252
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,495
It's 8:30.

253
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,062
Patrick, stop it.

254
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,344
Ohh! Okay.

255
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,854
Okay. Okay.

256
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:17,289
Whew. Okay.

257
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,352
Showtime at the Apollo.

258
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,240
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

259
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,435
Quiet.

260
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,424
Hey, Joel. What's up?

261
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,426
Oh. Hi, Frank.

262
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,766
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.

263
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,772
How pathetic is that?

264
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,774
You're lucky you have Clementine, Joel.

265
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:10,778
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine's Day plans with her?

266
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,780
No.

267
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,782
It's only a day away.

268
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,284
Better make a reservation or something.

269
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:19,286
Don't wanna end up at Mickey D's.

270
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,845
Oh, no!

271
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,189
Yes! You know Valentine's Day is three goddamn days away! I want it resolved.

272
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,388
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.

273
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:31,796
So I call her, and she's changed her number.

274
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,961
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get her something.

275
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:39,537
I thought, you know, I'd go over to work, give her an early valentine, and...

276
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,610
You won't believe it.

277
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,442
She's there with...

278
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:49,211
this guy, this really young guy.

279
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,742
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.

280
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,255
Excuse me?

281
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,986
Can I help you find something, sir?

282
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,864
Hey, Clem-ato.

283
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,992
Patrick! Baby boy.

284
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:12,273
- What you doing here, baby? - Just came to surprise you.

285
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,242
- Let me know if you need something, sir. - You look good.

286
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,244
Hi.

287
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,406
- How are you? - Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

288
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,416
Uh-huh.

289
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,612
- I so want what's in your suit. - Oh, good.

290
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:38,162
Why?

291
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,724
Why would she do that to me?

292
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,331
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

293
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,003
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

294
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,012
Oh, God. She's punishing me.

295
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,014
- I know, honey. - For being honest.

296
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:55,346
- It's horrible. - I should just go to her house.

297
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:58,353
No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there, man. You don't wanna go there.

298
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:00,787
Get off. It's too...

299
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,791
- Right. - Yeah.

300
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,793
I don't want to seem desperate.

301
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:09,457
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign, make a clean break. Right?

302
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,660
Right?

303
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,804
All right, Joel, look, man, seriously.

304
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,807
- Rob! - Here's the deal.

305
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,038
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing? No, no, no, no.

306
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:25,274
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie? What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

307
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:27,873
You're gonna make this about our shit now? This isn't about us.

308
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,011
I agree. It's not about us. It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

309
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:34,079
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

310
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,326
- What are you... - That's your laundry!

311
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:43,287
That's great. That's good.

312
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:55,300
Okay.

313
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:06,517
- What is it? - I don't know. It's some place that does a thing.

314
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:20,427
Good morning. Lacuna.

315
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,429
No, I'm sorry. That offer expired after the new year.

316
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:30,337
Yeah, sure. We can fit you in...

317
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,711
How about on the fifth?

318
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:36,183
That's a Wednesday. All right, great. Could you spell that, please?

319
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,786
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.

320
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:44,451
Great. Have a nice day. See you then.

321
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,461
May I help you?

322
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:49,464
- I'm Joel Barish. - Excuse me?

323
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:53,093
I'm Joel. Barish. I have an appointment with Dr...

324
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,103
Mierzwiak.

325
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:58,470
- Here. Could you please fill this out? - I just want to talk to him.

326
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,532
- You still need to fill the form out, sir. - Really?

327
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,704
- Thank you. - Great.

328
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,713
I don't have a pen.

329
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,875
There's a pen right there.

330
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:10,885
- Good morning. Lacuna. - Oh.

331
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:14,821
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now. That expired after the new year.

332
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,881
Mr. Barish?

333
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,195
How are we today?

334
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,197
Not too good, actually.

335
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:25,199
- Boo! - Oh, my God! Stan!

336
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:28,202
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just... - I'm working!

337
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,569
Sorry. Sorry.

338
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,632
- Here, Doctor. - Thank you.

339
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,578
You should not have seen this.

340
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:38,637
I apologize.

341
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,952
This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem...

342
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,854
- I assure you, no. - No.

343
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:56,026
- Mm-mmm. - There's no such thing as this.

344
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,730
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish,

345
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,271
so I can't show you evidence.

346
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:09,073
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

347
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,204
and she wanted to move on.

348
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,214
We provide that possibility.

349
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:17,343
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.

350
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,945
We provide that possibility."

351
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,956
What the hell is that?

352
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:24,959
Nicest guy she ever went out with.

353
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,961
Oww! Fuck!

354
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,463
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

355
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:31,466
It's okay. It's all right.

356
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:34,230
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.

357
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:40,005
What can I say, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that.

358
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,873
She's impulsive.

359
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:45,505
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.

360
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,352
A lark.

361
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,856
Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that?

362
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

363
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,197
I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here.

364
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,257
- Okay. I want it done. - I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

365
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,702
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary. - But there are people waiting.

366
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,707
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh... to come inside.

367
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:16,336
- And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo. - Yes, of course. - Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

368
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:23,077
Now, the, uh...

369
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:26,087
the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

370
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,089
is to go home...

371
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:33,595
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.

372
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,892
Anything.

373
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:41,598
And we'll use these items to create a map of Clementine in your brain.

374
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,264
Okay?

375
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,403
So we'll need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

376
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:54,438
books she may have bought you, CDs you may have bought together,

377
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:57,145
journal entries.

378
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,982
We want to empty your home...

379
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:03,388
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

380
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:07,953
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

381
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,363
That way, when you awake in the morning,

382
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:15,870
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened...

383
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:18,429
a new life awaiting you.

384
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,902
Wake up, buddy!

385
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,882
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

386
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:35,117
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

387
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:39,787
Well, it's just not our policy... How are you today, Mr. Barish?

388
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,524
Hello. I'm right here.

389
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,797
I know it's an emergency and we'll do everything we can... We can fit you in on the first of March.

390
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,306
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, a-and he...

391
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:55,639
All right, so let's make an appointment. What day would you like to come in this week?

392
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,147
- Mr. Barish. - Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

393
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:03,174
Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that?

394
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:07,121
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

395
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,327
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

396
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:18,592
one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.

397
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,161
He'll be handling your case tonight.

398
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,673
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

399
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,675
My name is Joel Barish,

400
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:32,305
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

401
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:37,409
Very good. Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

402
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,012
Uh, I was...

403
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,889
living with this woman, Naomi,

404
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,520
uh, a couple years ago,

405
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:51,829
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach... I don't like parties.

406
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:55,132
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

407
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:58,367
and I, uh, met Clementine.

408
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,433
I'm sorry.

409
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,446
Let's start with your most recent memories...

410
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:08,109
and work backwards from there, more or less.

411
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:10,118
There's an emotional core...

412
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:12,120
to each of our memories,

413
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:15,954
and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.

414
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:18,459
By the time you wake up in the morning,

415
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,259
all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared,

416
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:24,356
as in a dream upon waking.

417
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:27,732
Is there any risk of brain damage?

418
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,795
Well, uh, technically speaking,

419
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:32,807
the procedure is brain damage,

420
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,708
but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.

421
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:37,712
Nothing you'll miss.

422
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,180
Comfortable?

423
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:45,880
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map of your brain.

424
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:48,287
Okay, let's get started.

425
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:52,088
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.

426
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,995
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.

427
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,102
There's a good story behind this one...

428
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,105
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout...

429
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:08,075
if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

430
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:10,078
Just try to focus on the memories.

431
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:12,706
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

432
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:18,920
Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts. Very good.

433
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:22,253
- Here's another object. - That's so...

434
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:24,919
Next item. Okay.

435
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,429
Potato head.

436
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:31,762
Next item. Okay.

437
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:36,703
Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a favor.

438
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:40,105
- Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya? - Yeah.

439
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:44,044
Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there?

440
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,047
- Uh, voltage looks fine. - Really?

441
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:50,108
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here. I'm...

442
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:58,186
Well, uh, technically the procedure is brain damage.

443
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,729
Check the, uh... Check the connections, please.

444
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,162
Oh, there you are. I...

445
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:16,602
Why am I... I don't understand what I'm looking at.

446
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,477
Why am I standing here and...

447
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:22,381
Oh, my God. Déjà vu.

448
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,544
Déjà vu. This is so...

449
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,555
All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure...

450
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:30,558
underway tonight, we have some work to do.

451
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:33,151
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

452
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:36,562
I suppose so. Uh, this is about right.

453
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:39,624
This is what it... This is what it would look like.

454
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:44,138
Very good.

455
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:46,470
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.

456
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,875
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.

457
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,209
Ah, there we go.

458
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,714
- Patrick? - Yeah?

459
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,445
- Patrick, can you check... - Patrick?

460
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,977
- I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. - Patrick? Patrick?

461
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:03,958
- Why are there so many wires? - A lot of equipment.

462
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:07,826
- Does that help? - Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

463
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:09,831
- How's that? - How are you today, Mr. Barish?

464
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,992
- There we are, Mr. Barish. - That's better.

465
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:15,401
- I don't know if I like this. - Think I might try this, then.

466
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,371
We're almost done now.

467
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,568
Mmm. Journal. That would be invaluable.

468
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:24,739
"I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do.

469
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,374
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing."

470
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,975
Whoa! Jesus!

471
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:32,987
- What? What? - Come on! Careful! Step back!

472
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:34,989
Just take it easy.

473
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:36,888
That's fine.

474
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,790
Let's not roach the guy.

475
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:44,323
All right, you got that one.

476
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,200
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? - It's an apartment, Patrick.

477
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,534
Patrick.

478
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:54,702
Well, not a dump, then, but sorta plain. Uninspired.

479
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:57,211
And there's sort of a stale smell.

480
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:01,841
Patrick, can we just please get through this?

481
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:05,546
- We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on. - Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:13,053
This is the last time I saw you.

483
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:30,178
It's 3:00.

484
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:34,842
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

485
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,851
Were you driving drunk?

486
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:39,183
It's pathetic.

487
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:41,485
I was a little tipsy.

488
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,491
Don't call me pathetic.

489
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,493
Well, it is pathetic.

490
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:48,496
- It's fucking irresponsible. Could've killed somebody. - Oh, God.

491
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,499
- Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we turn on the news and see? - Oh, Christ!

492
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,866
- Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals? - I didn't kill anybody!

493
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:58,805
It's just a fucking dent, Joel. You're like an old lady or something.

494
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:01,308
Well, what are you like?

495
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:03,311
- A wino? - A wino?

496
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:06,314
Jesus, are you from the '50s or something?

497
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,316
A wino?

498
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:10,648
Face it, Joely.

499
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,156
You're freaked out because I was out late without you,

500
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:18,159
and in your little wormy brain...

501
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:22,220
you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?

502
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,767
No, see, Clem,

503
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,429
I assume you fucked someone tonight.

504
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:30,938
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

505
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:44,185
I'm sorry. Okay?

506
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:47,086
Clem, I didn't mean it. All right?

507
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:54,529
- Clem? - Your keys.

508
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:57,532
- I was just... I was just... - I won't need them anymore.

509
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,694
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.

510
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,400
Clem?

511
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,374
Got it.

512
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,384
Mary's coming over tonight.

513
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:18,079
- Yeah? - Yeah.

514
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,087
Just thought you'd wanna know.

515
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,181
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

516
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:25,819
She likes you okay.

517
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,989
So, maybe I should invite my girlfriend over. I have a girlfriend now.

518
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:31,589
- Do whatever you want. - Did I tell you I have...

519
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,601
Yeah.

520
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:41,008
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

521
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:43,010
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

522
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:45,012
Yeah, the thing is,

523
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,981
our situation is... is a little weird.

524
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,041
My girlfriend situation.

525
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,917
I'm sure it is.

526
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:54,979
You gotta be...

527
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,984
Clem, let me drive you home.

528
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,145
Get out of my face, faggot!

529
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:30,117
Look at it out here! It's all falling apart!

530
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:32,558
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

531
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,562
You did it to me first!

532
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,623
I can't believe you did this to me. Goddamn it.

533
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:41,636
Clem! Can you hear me?

534
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:44,298
By morning you'll be gone!

535
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:47,865
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!

536
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:56,677
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me? Is that a problem?

537
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,277
No, I think it's... funny.

538
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:02,449
So, who do you think's better-looking, me or this guy?

539
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,458
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

540
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:07,120
Remember that girl we did last week?

541
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:10,324
The one with the... potatoes?

542
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:15,470
That girl? That's this guy's girl.

543
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,471
- Right. - Yeah.

544
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:20,474
Was. We took care of that.

545
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,033
- Oh, God! - Well, uh...

546
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,979
I kinda fell in love with her that night.

547
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:28,983
What? You little fuck...

548
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,043
- What? - She was unconscious, man.

549
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:35,147
Well, she was beautiful, and...

550
00:39:35,224 --> 00:39:38,216
I stole a pair of her panties as well.

551
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,064
- Jesus! - What?

552
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,066
It's not like...

553
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:47,626
- I mean, they were clean and all. - Don't tell me this stuff, man! I don't wanna hear this shit!

554
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:50,137
- They were clean! - What? D-Don't! Stop!

555
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,640
- Okay. Yeah! All right! - We got work to do.

556
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:54,699
Give me my papers.

557
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,591
There's, um...

558
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:13,952
There's more.

559
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:18,066
After we did her, I kind of...

560
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:21,535
went to where she works and asked her out.

561
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:24,933
You what?

562
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,635
- Jesus. - Jesus, Patrick!

563
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:31,670
Do you have... any idea...

564
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,578
how unethical...

565
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:36,584
It's not really that bad.

566
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:39,382
What? Get that look off your face. What's wrong?

567
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:42,754
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

568
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,061
There's someone here.

569
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,040
He stole your underwear.

570
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:03,272
I don't see anyone.

571
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:21,820
Joel?

572
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,297
Where are my boots?

573
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,825
Why are you showing me poisons? Can't you understand English?

574
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,895
"Potions", I said. Potions.

575
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,280
Love potion, please.

576
00:41:39,348 --> 00:41:42,249
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!

577
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:47,879
Should've left you at the flea market.

578
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:52,194
First thing to do is...

579
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,253
sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.

580
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:02,664
Wanna go?

581
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,974
I want to have a baby.

582
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:08,943
Let's talk about it later.

583
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:12,174
No! I want to have a baby.

584
00:42:13,315 --> 00:42:16,250
I don't think we're ready.

585
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:18,343
You're not ready.

586
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:21,652
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?

587
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:23,885
What?

588
00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:27,828
I don't wanna talk about it here.

589
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:30,661
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.

590
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,167
- I don't wanna talk about this! - Fucking ventriloquist!

591
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:35,669
- We're fucking gonna talk about it! - I... don't... want... to...

592
00:42:35,738 --> 00:42:38,332
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!

593
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,342
- I'm sorry, Clem. - I'd make a fucking good mother!

594
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,847
- I love children, I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking great mother! - Oh, God... Mmm!

595
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:49,282
It's you, Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!

596
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:53,048
- It's going! It's going! - You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!

597
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:56,057
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

598
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,492
- Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry! - It's done. This is crap.

599
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:03,054
- Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in! - All the pain, confusion...

600
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,669
- Oh. Hi, Patrick. - Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

601
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:16,678
- Hey, you. - Oh, it's freezing outside.

602
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:18,577
- Find us okay? - Yeah.

603
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:24,442
- Mmm. - Hot!

604
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,588
Poor guy.

605
00:43:27,656 --> 00:43:30,386
Mmm? Oh.

606
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:32,689
Don't you have anything real to drink?

607
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:35,697
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.

608
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:37,699
- Patrick? - Uh, yeah.

609
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:40,167
Uh, let me do the honors.

610
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,404
Mary hates me.

611
00:43:43,472 --> 00:43:46,134
Never really had much luck with the ladies.

612
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,142
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.

613
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,236
Stan. Stan.

614
00:43:51,313 --> 00:43:52,746
- There's more. - No!

615
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,112
- Yes. - No!

616
00:43:54,183 --> 00:43:58,085
Hey, hey!

617
00:43:58,154 --> 00:44:01,089
Oh, you didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

618
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:03,751
- Uh, no, that's okay. - Wait.

619
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:08,126
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

620
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:12,133
Oh.

621
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:14,135
- Oh! - Oh!

622
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,967
Mmm!

623
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:22,410
That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil.

624
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:24,742
I found it in my Bartlett's.

625
00:44:24,814 --> 00:44:26,748
What's your Bartlett's?

626
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,716
It's a quote book, Patrick.

627
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:30,684
It's a book of quotations.

628
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:33,244
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

629
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,256
Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's.

630
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,690
God!

631
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,320
Can you wake him up?

632
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:42,330
You can't wake him up.

633
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:47,559
Mmm.

634
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,898
You don't tell me things, Joel.

635
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:57,378
I'm an open book.

636
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,548
I tell you everything.

637
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:03,847
Every damn embarrassing thing.

638
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,548
You don't trust me.

639
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:12,151
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

640
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:16,588
I don't do that.

641
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:21,059
I want to know you.

642
00:45:22,238 --> 00:45:24,172
Hmm?

643
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,266
I don't constantly talk. Jesus!

644
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,305
People have to share things, Joel.

645
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,314
Mm-hmm.

646
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:35,475
That's what intimacy is.

647
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:38,486
I'm really pissed that you said that to me.

648
00:45:38,554 --> 00:45:40,488
I'm sorry.

649
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:43,548
It just... really just isn't that interesting.

650
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,695
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

651
00:45:47,763 --> 00:45:50,926
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions or...

652
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,991
love?

653
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:04,871
November 19, 2003.

654
00:46:04,947 --> 00:46:07,609
Dinner at Kang's again.

655
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,954
Are we like those poor couples...

656
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:15,752
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

657
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:18,190
Are we the dining dead?

658
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,959
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

659
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:29,370
I like that.

660
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,640
How's the chicken?

661
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,699
Good.

662
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:39,080
- More? - No. No. Thank you.

663
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:44,551
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

664
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,054
Hey, would you do me a favor...

665
00:46:47,122 --> 00:46:50,091
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?

666
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,093
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah. - It's really...

667
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:54,254
- Gross. - gross.

668
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,056
- It's just... - Repulsive.

669
00:46:59,134 --> 00:47:00,795
It's repulsive.

670
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:09,237
Patrick, can we get through this?

671
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,074
Patrick.

672
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:13,080
Hey, Tangerine.

673
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:16,276
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

674
00:47:16,352 --> 00:47:18,616
I'm so miserable right now.

675
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:21,087
- Why? What's wrong? - I don't know.

676
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:23,090
- Excuse me? - I'm so confused!

677
00:47:23,158 --> 00:47:25,092
Can I help you find something, sir?

678
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,152
Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine.

679
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:31,098
Baby, come here.

680
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:33,157
Scared of what?

681
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:40,265
- Do you love me? - Of course I do.

682
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:42,276
Where's the self-help section?

683
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:44,812
Do you think I'm ugly?

684
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,764
No! You're beautiful!

685
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:49,097
- Maybe I should come over. - No, no.

686
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:52,103
I don't know. I-I'm a mess, Patrick.

687
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:54,867
Well, just let me come over. I'll cheer you up.

688
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,806
Okay.

689
00:47:56,876 --> 00:48:00,073
Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset.

690
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,341
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's...

691
00:48:02,415 --> 00:48:04,349
Let him go, Stan!

692
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:07,352
Let him go. I'll help.

693
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,354
- See? - How hard can it be?

694
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:13,119
- She hates me. She wants me to go. - Go.

695
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:16,093
All right. I'll be right over, Tangerine.

696
00:48:16,162 --> 00:48:17,857
You like?

697
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,990
Oh, man!

698
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:23,035
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

699
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:25,036
- I like it. - You do?

700
00:48:25,104 --> 00:48:27,334
- You look like a tangerine. - Ohh!

701
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:30,864
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine. - Mmm! Juicy!

702
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:33,434
- And seedless. - I like that.

703
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:37,315
I like tangerines!

704
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:39,544
Can you see me doing ducks?

705
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,520
- Tangerine. - Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

706
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:45,523
- How does he know to call you that? - How did who know?

707
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:48,355
- Oh, my God. Clem? - This is pretty cool.

708
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:50,361
That's what they called themselves.

709
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,863
The Clash... the only band that mattered.

710
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,866
They called themselves that for a reason.

711
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:58,301
- It's amazing, isn't it? - Like social justice... Yeah, it's totally incredible.

712
00:48:58,371 --> 00:49:00,896
What Howard gives to the world.

713
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:04,001
Yeah.

714
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:06,510
To let people begin again.

715
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,515
It's beautiful.

716
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:15,520
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

717
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:19,024
And adults are, like, this mess of sadness...

718
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:21,889
and... phobias.

719
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:25,021
Howard just makes it all go away.

720
00:49:34,907 --> 00:49:36,898
Oh, my God.

721
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:41,613
- Baby, what's going on? - I don't know. I don't know!

722
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:44,081
I'm lost, I'm scared,

723
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,084
I feel like I'm disappearing.

724
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:49,087
- Disappearing? - My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

725
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:52,090
- Nothing makes any sense to me! - You're not getting old.

726
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:55,389
- Nothing makes any sense. - Ohh, Tangerine.

727
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,759
Nothing makes any sense.

728
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:01,459
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick. - It's okay. It's okay.

729
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:05,561
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah? You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

730
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:07,572
- Montauk? - Yeah.

731
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,337
- No! Come up to Boston with me. - Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend.

732
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,050
No, no. Now. Now.

733
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,650
Yeah. I have to go now.

734
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:17,148
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

735
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,154
Hi, it's Joel.

736
00:50:23,222 --> 00:50:28,421
Um, leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.

737
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:32,930
Pick up! Pick up, man!

738
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:35,797
W-W-W-W-Whoa. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

739
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,304
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

740
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:43,467
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

741
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:46,306
Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

742
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:49,314
Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man.

743
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:52,943
- He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway. - Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

744
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:55,749
Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go.

745
00:50:57,623 --> 00:50:59,614
Charles.

746
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:03,752
Come on, Charles.

747
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:12,701
"Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem.

748
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:16,970
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want..."

749
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:21,606
- I'm so excited. Yea. - I'm excited too!

750
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:25,549
- Cool. - Oh, uh, I, uh...

751
00:51:25,618 --> 00:51:28,485
I got you this...

752
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:31,614
- What? - thing, um...

753
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:33,625
Happy early Valentine's Day.

754
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:35,684
Oh!

755
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:39,154
Wow. What is it?

756
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,722
Uh, I don't know. Open it up.

757
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:49,207
Oh.

758
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,209
It... It's gorgeous!

759
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:54,212
- You like it? - Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

760
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,649
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

761
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,709
Thank you.

762
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:09,661
- Let's go. - Okay.

763
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:12,997
- Joely? - Yeah, Tangerine?

764
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:17,158
Am I ugly?

765
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:20,672
When I was a kid, I thought I was.

766
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,836
Can't believe I'm crying already.

767
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:30,746
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely it is to be a kid.

768
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,842
Like you don't matter.

769
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,252
So, I'm eight...

770
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,587
and I have these toys,

771
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,592
these dolls.

772
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,393
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

773
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:48,399
And I keep yelling at her:

774
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:52,801
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

775
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:54,897
It's weird.

776
00:52:54,974 --> 00:52:58,000
Like if I can transform her,

777
00:52:58,077 --> 00:53:00,705
I would magically change too.

778
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:07,385
You're pretty.

779
00:53:07,453 --> 00:53:10,616
Joely, don't ever leave me.

780
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:14,716
Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty.

781
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:18,730
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.

782
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:20,732
Just this one.

783
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,735
I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on.

784
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:25,498
- Whoo! - Whoa!

785
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:27,505
Stop it!

786
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:33,605
I could die right now, Clem.

787
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,838
I'm just...

788
00:53:38,651 --> 00:53:40,812
happy.

789
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,383
I've never felt that before.

790
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:48,459
Mmm.

791
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,518
I'm just exactly...

792
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:54,756
where I wanna be.

793
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:57,826
Clem?

794
00:54:04,043 --> 00:54:06,534
I wanna call it off.

795
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,603
I'll give you a sign.

796
00:54:13,452 --> 00:54:15,802
I wanna call it off!

797
00:54:17,156 --> 00:54:20,091
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore!

798
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,525
I wanna call it off!

799
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:32,533
Is anybody there?

800
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:41,435
- Clementine? - Joel?

801
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:43,743
- Clement... - Joely?

802
00:54:43,816 --> 00:54:45,909
- Clem! - Joel?

803
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,783
Clem!

804
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:51,084
- What? - We gotta go. We gotta go.

805
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:53,590
- What? Where? - I have an idea of how to stop this.

806
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,991
Stop what?

807
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:57,995
- Joely. - Come on, Clem.

808
00:54:58,063 --> 00:55:01,362
- Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit! - No!

809
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:03,993
- Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you. - Smell my pits!

810
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:06,003
- No. - Good.

811
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:08,437
Concentrate, Clem.

812
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:10,998
We gotta get back to the office.

813
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:13,601
There was a tape recorder. No, not the picture.

814
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,704
Not the picture.

815
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:18,841
Where is it? Back here. Come on!

816
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,580
Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there.

817
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:25,351
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish,

818
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:27,358
so I can't show you evidence.

819
00:55:27,426 --> 00:55:30,827
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh... Miss Kruczynski...

820
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:34,764
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

821
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:39,361
- Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. - Just tell me everything you remember.

822
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:42,305
- That's what he said. Then... - What did we see that day?

823
00:55:42,374 --> 00:55:44,308
- No, wait. - Oh, look! Hey!

824
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:46,867
- Shit! - We're going to see my grandma.

825
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:49,642
- Joel, why... - No, I don't want to... - Joel, please! - We're not going on a train.

826
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:52,479
- Don't make me run anymore. - Come on!

827
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:54,883
Mierzwiak!

828
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:57,923
- Do we always have to run? - Mierzwiak!

829
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:09,233
Please.

830
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:12,668
So, why don't we begin by you telling me...

831
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:14,831
everything you can remember.

832
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:17,398
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

833
00:56:17,476 --> 00:56:20,502
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

834
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:23,571
I thought you understood what was going on here.

835
00:56:23,649 --> 00:56:26,812
I don't know. You're erasing her from me.

836
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,820
You're erasing me from her...

837
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:34,292
I don't know.

838
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,023
You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it.

839
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:40,031
I'm in my brain.

840
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

841
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:45,696
How can I help you from there?

842
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:49,263
Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.

843
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:52,970
Sorry.

844
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:55,104
Look. Who's that?

845
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,239
Oh, he-he works for us.

846
00:56:57,316 --> 00:57:01,980
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

847
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:04,648
baby boy.

848
00:57:04,723 --> 00:57:07,214
He's stealing my identity.

849
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:09,692
He stole my stuff.

850
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:13,459
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.

851
00:57:13,532 --> 00:57:16,729
He stole her underwear. Oh, Jesus Christ!

852
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:18,736
He stole her underwear.

853
00:57:18,804 --> 00:57:22,205
I could die right now, Clem.

854
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:24,742
I'm just happy.

855
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:29,406
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

856
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,940
I want to go home.

857
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:35,987
Hey. What?

858
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:42,053
Clem!

859
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:44,118
Wait. Clem!

860
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:47,392
Clem?

861
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:49,934
They're erasing you.

862
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:51,936
I'm here!

863
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:54,666
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

864
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,674
I'm so stupid.

865
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:59,768
Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery.

866
00:57:59,845 --> 00:58:03,178
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.

867
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:09,049
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.

868
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:12,352
What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

869
00:58:12,424 --> 00:58:14,187
Wake yourself up!

870
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:17,023
Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right.

871
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:19,997
- Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? - Yeah.

872
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:23,091
I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea.

873
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,295
Yeah. Okay.

874
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,601
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.

875
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:31,199
- Don't! That tickles me! - Oh, my goodness.

876
00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:33,710
Oh, my God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the...

877
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:35,713
It's a birthmark!

878
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:42,282
It did work, for a second,

879
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:44,879
- but I couldn't... I couldn't move. - See?

880
00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:49,621
Oh, well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

881
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:52,027
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually...

882
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:55,260
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

883
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:58,667
Fine.

884
00:58:58,737 --> 00:59:01,729
Then what? I'm listening.

885
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:04,503
I don't know. You erased me.

886
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:07,238
That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

887
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,246
- I'm sorry. - You... You!

888
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:11,748
You know me. I'm impulsive.

889
00:59:15,053 --> 00:59:17,146
That's what I love about you.

890
00:59:20,926 --> 00:59:22,450
Joel?

891
00:59:22,528 --> 00:59:25,497
- Mm-hmm? - I have another idea for this problem.

892
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:27,828
This is a memory of me,

893
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,599
the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.

894
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:35,606
- What? - Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

895
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:38,666
so what if you take me somewhere else,

896
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:40,905
somewhere where I don't belong,

897
00:59:40,979 --> 00:59:43,539
and we hide there till morning?

898
00:59:47,953 --> 00:59:51,354
Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you.

899
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,586
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?

900
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,594
Okay.

901
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:01,500
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

902
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,900
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

903
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

904
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:10,350
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

905
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:12,446
Life is but a dream

906
01:00:20,553 --> 01:00:22,612
It's working!

907
01:00:22,688 --> 01:00:26,249
I'm a genius!

908
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:50,942
Joel?

909
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:54,846
Where'd you go?

910
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,717
I'm supposed to come too!

911
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:00,316
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?

912
01:01:00,392 --> 01:01:02,326
Sure. He just likes to be near me.

913
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:04,362
- Absolutely! - Clem?

914
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,930
It worked.

915
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:08,502
My God, look at this! Wow!

916
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:12,831
It worked! Look! Look at this dress, man!

917
01:01:12,905 --> 01:01:17,467
Oh, my God! Look at it! I wish I could take it with me.

918
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:19,490
Who am I?

919
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:21,812
- Mrs. Hamlyn. - Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

920
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:24,541
I must be about four. Oh, my gosh.

921
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:27,916
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.

922
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:30,478
Is he okay under there? Peanut, are you all right?

923
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:33,753
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.

924
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:36,886
- Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans? - No, not at all.

925
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:39,488
Oh, my God. I love this kitchen.

926
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:42,557
- Thank you so much. - She's not looking at me.

927
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:45,763
She's busy. She's not looking at me.

928
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:49,171
No one ever looks at me. I want my mommy.

929
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:50,742
Oh, baby Joel.

930
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:52,250
Hey, Joely! Joely!

931
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:54,836
- Is every little peanut under there okay? - Mm-hmm! He's fine.

932
01:01:54,914 --> 01:01:57,246
Do you have something to drink?

933
01:01:57,316 --> 01:01:59,978
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

934
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:02,543
- I would die for a vodka. - Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that.

935
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:05,352
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

936
01:02:05,425 --> 01:02:07,359
Uh, Joely.

937
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:11,056
- Your mother wants me to mind you. Get back under the table. - Ice cream.

938
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:15,499
- Ice cream. - No, not until after, you know, you've had your dinner.

939
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:17,593
Come on, Joel!

940
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,604
Joel, grow up!

941
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:22,038
Don't leave me, Clem. Oh, my God, Clem.

942
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:24,542
- This is sort of warped. - I'm scared.

943
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,909
- I want my mommy! - Don't cry, baby Joel.

944
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:32,250
Baby Joel, it's okay. Joel. Joely. Joel!

945
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:35,149
Stop it! Look, I think it's working. Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

946
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:38,054
Hey, honey, look.

947
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:40,115
Wait there.

948
01:02:43,496 --> 01:02:46,226
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.

949
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:48,233
Yuck.

950
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:54,395
It stopped.

951
01:02:54,474 --> 01:02:58,205
- What? - It stopped erasing.

952
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:00,711
Oh, shit.

953
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,771
This is terrible.

954
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:06,615
He's off the map. He's off the map.

955
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:10,247
- Where? - I don't know where! What do you mean? I don't know where!

956
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:14,419
This is bad. This is very, very bad news. Where are my glasses?

957
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:17,054
Okay. Crap.

958
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:19,893
Okay. What do we do? What do I do?

959
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:22,526
- What shall we do? - I don't know what to do.

960
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:24,832
- What shall we do? - Crap. Crap. I don't know!

961
01:03:24,904 --> 01:03:27,532
- I just said that I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry. What do we do?

962
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:31,202
I don't know. Now, look, you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

963
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:35,111
Well, you have to do something. He could wake up all half-baked.

964
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:38,207
Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.

965
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:41,276
All gooey and... and half-baked. Hmm, that sounds so good.

966
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:43,288
- Oh, shit! - I'm hungry.

967
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:45,290
- Oh, shit. - Oh! Oh!

968
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:47,826
What? Oh! What, what? What?

969
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:50,829
- We should call Howard. - No way. No, sir, man.

970
01:03:50,897 --> 01:03:53,058
This is my... I can handle this.

971
01:03:53,132 --> 01:03:55,430
- I can't call Howard. - He's an unbaked cookie.

972
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:58,197
He's... There's no time to fuck around.

973
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:00,762
I got this under control. What are you talking about?

974
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,707
- Stop fucking around! - Okay, I'll call Howard.

975
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:14,817
- Hello. - Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan.

976
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:18,721
Um, I'm working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

977
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,555
and, uh, I can't... I can't bring him back up.

978
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:25,063
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.

979
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:28,532
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I was away from the monitor for a minute...

980
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:31,297
and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh...

981
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,304
I had to pee.

982
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:37,069
- Where's Patrick? - Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

983
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:39,077
Ah, geez.

984
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:41,909
- Okay, what's the address? - I know. I'm so sorry.

985
01:04:41,981 --> 01:04:45,678
- That's okay. Come on. - I'm at 159 South Village.

986
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:48,914
- Yeah. - Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.

987
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:51,650
- Mary? - Yeah? - He's coming right now.

988
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:53,658
I'm staying.

989
01:04:53,726 --> 01:04:56,092
- Get your stuff, Mary. - I'm staying.

990
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:58,653
- I think you should go. - Hell, no.

991
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:02,326
Mary... Shit.

992
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:06,394
- I am so stoned. - Please, Mary.

993
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:08,838
- You have to go. - Stop being stoned, Mary.

994
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:11,706
I don't want him to see me stoned.

995
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:15,941
- Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into if Howard comes... - I look like shit!

996
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:18,015
Joely, stop it! Joel! Look!

997
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:19,375
Hey, Joel!

998
01:05:25,124 --> 01:05:27,115
- Joel! - I want her to pick me up.

999
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:30,720
- It's weird how strong that desire is. - Joel, look at me! Look.

1000
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:33,128
You'll remember me in the morning,

1001
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,362
and you'll come to me, and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.

1002
01:05:36,435 --> 01:05:38,801
Pat? I just... Pat?

1003
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:41,032
I thought we could have a little cocktail.

1004
01:05:41,107 --> 01:05:43,575
That Patrick guy... he's copying me.

1005
01:05:43,643 --> 01:05:45,634
What Patrick guy?

1006
01:05:45,711 --> 01:05:47,474
- That guy! - What?

1007
01:05:47,546 --> 01:05:49,411
He's here in my apartment.

1008
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:51,416
He's one of those eraser guys.

1009
01:05:51,484 --> 01:05:55,818
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,

1010
01:05:55,888 --> 01:05:58,220
and you guys are dating.

1011
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,521
Really? Is he cute?

1012
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:06,329
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.

1013
01:06:06,399 --> 01:06:08,993
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

1014
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:12,003
You... You're kind,

1015
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:14,301
beautiful...

1016
01:06:14,373 --> 01:06:16,603
and smart and funny...

1017
01:06:16,676 --> 01:06:18,906
and... nice.

1018
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:21,208
What?

1019
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:24,882
Okay. All right.

1020
01:06:26,419 --> 01:06:28,717
Okay. Oh!

1021
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:31,086
- Move, move, move! - Careful, careful. - Come on. Let's go.

1022
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:32,954
Fine.

1023
01:06:33,025 --> 01:06:36,426
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1024
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:38,895
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.

1025
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:45,570
Be cool. Cool.

1026
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:52,440
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here? - Oh, hi, Howard.

1027
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,445
She was just here to help out.

1028
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:57,676
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.

1029
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:01,447
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings...

1030
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,715
of the work that we do.

1031
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:06,485
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done...

1032
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,256
by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.

1033
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:13,355
All right, well, let's see if we can, uh,

1034
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:15,992
get to the bottom of this, shall we?

1035
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:18,059
Uh, yeah. Um...

1036
01:07:20,806 --> 01:07:23,274
- Well, that's odd. - I already tried that.

1037
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:27,108
- Did you try going through the C-gate? - Yeah, of course.

1038
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:28,976
I mean... yes.

1039
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:31,278
Yeah.

1040
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:35,420
All right.

1041
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:38,890
- You want to get linked up? - Yeah.

1042
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:41,256
All right.

1043
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:43,955
I already... I ran the utility programs,

1044
01:07:44,029 --> 01:07:46,020
and I had nothing there,

1045
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:49,090
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1046
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:51,159
- Here, Howard. - Okay.

1047
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:53,637
- I got you a chair. - Oh, thank you. - There you go.

1048
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:56,266
You're welcome.

1049
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:59,937
All right, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1050
01:08:00,012 --> 01:08:02,003
see if something comes up.

1051
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:11,245
I love being bathed in the sink.

1052
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:13,814
Such a feeling of security.

1053
01:08:13,893 --> 01:08:17,124
- I've never seen you happier, baby Joel. - Hmm!

1054
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:19,130
There it is.

1055
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,532
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.

1056
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:25,661
What the heck was he doing there?

1057
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:37,238
His eyes are open.

1058
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:42,713
- Has this happened before with him? - No.

1059
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:46,349
Oh, this is... this is not good. No.

1060
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:48,655
I'm gonna have to...

1061
01:08:48,727 --> 01:08:50,661
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1062
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:17,715
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1063
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,953
Okay, we're back in.

1064
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:25,258
Wow. That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

1065
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:29,358
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.

1066
01:09:29,435 --> 01:09:31,369
Thank you, Mary.

1067
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:35,533
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep. I-I think I'll be fine now.

1068
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:40,170
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1069
01:09:40,246 --> 01:09:42,237
Hmm. Lucky me.

1070
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:46,717
Lay one on me.

1071
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:49,980
Don't call me Antoine.

1072
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:52,455
- My name is Wally. - Yes, I know,

1073
01:09:52,524 --> 01:09:55,084
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1074
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,560
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1075
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,326
- Hey. - My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

1076
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:02,890
There is?

1077
01:10:04,036 --> 01:10:06,504
- Got it. - Tangerine!

1078
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:09,598
- What, Joel... What are you doing? - We gotta go.

1079
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:12,337
Go on. Please, please, go. Please go!

1080
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:17,079
You can run, but you can't hide.

1081
01:10:17,149 --> 01:10:18,946
Clem, come on!

1082
01:10:19,985 --> 01:10:21,919
There I am.

1083
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:23,921
That truck.

1084
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:26,890
Doc? Please.

1085
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:31,089
All right, let's begin by you telling me...

1086
01:10:31,163 --> 01:10:33,927
everything you remember...

1087
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:37,901
That's strange. He's in a memory that we've already erased.

1088
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,031
Oh, well, at least we know where he is. He's back on track, right?

1089
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:44,041
Come on, Clem.

1090
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:46,635
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.

1091
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:49,306
- I don't want to run anymore. - Shit.

1092
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,911
- Come on, come on. - Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

1093
01:10:54,987 --> 01:10:57,717
- Where? - Hide me in your humiliation.

1094
01:10:58,891 --> 01:11:01,485
- Humiliation. - Come on, you big baby!

1095
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,495
I'm sorry, okay?

1096
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:09,866
Let me drive you home.

1097
01:11:09,936 --> 01:11:12,370
No!

1098
01:11:12,438 --> 01:11:15,896
- Bye, Howard. - No, wait. Howard.

1099
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:18,239
He's disappeared again.

1100
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:22,509
- Oh, dear. - I'm so sorry, Howard.

1101
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:27,278
Humiliation.

1102
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:30,345
- Hu-mi-lia... - Joel.

1103
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:32,584
I don't like it either.

1104
01:11:32,658 --> 01:11:35,183
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to...

1105
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:38,230
Joel, honey, I have a surprise... I just... Oh, um...

1106
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:41,130
Uh, you know what, honey? I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1107
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,033
Good night, sweetheart.

1108
01:11:44,103 --> 01:11:46,435
No.

1109
01:11:46,506 --> 01:11:49,498
- I'm sorry, Joel. Joely. - Shut up.

1110
01:11:50,743 --> 01:11:53,610
Look! Joel!

1111
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,613
- Joel, look! - What?

1112
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,615
Look where we are!

1113
01:11:57,683 --> 01:12:00,117
Whoo!

1114
01:12:00,186 --> 01:12:02,620
Clem, this isn't good.

1115
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:06,556
Then hide me somewhere... somewhere really buried.

1116
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:12,058
- Hit it! Hit it! - I can't! I gotta go home.

1117
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:14,531
I'll do it later!

1118
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:21,195
Come on, you big sissy!

1119
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:31,746
Ooh!

1120
01:12:31,817 --> 01:12:34,911
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1121
01:12:34,987 --> 01:12:37,649
- Wait. What am I doing? - And he loves her! - You know something, Freddy?

1122
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,918
You don't scare me anymore. Ow! Ow!

1123
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:41,983
Joel!

1124
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:44,894
- Joely, get up. Come on, it's not worth it. - Hit him! Hit him!

1125
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:49,526
They're not worth it, Joel! Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1126
01:12:49,602 --> 01:12:51,661
- Come on, Joel. - Stupid!

1127
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:01,644
- I'm so ashamed. - It's okay.

1128
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,978
- You were a little kid. - Yeah?

1129
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,678
- Come on. - That's where I live... lived.

1130
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:09,016
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

1131
01:13:09,088 --> 01:13:12,785
Do you like my pink hat? Here, look, feel better. You can really kill me this time.

1132
01:13:12,858 --> 01:13:15,486
- It's my turn. Go. One, two, three. - I can? You're really gonna die though.

1133
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:17,791
- Okay. - One, two, three.

1134
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:20,354
You're dead.

1135
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:23,698
Oh, my mom. It's... It's okay. We're playing.

1136
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:26,465
- Hi, Joel's mom. He's killing me. - It's not real.

1137
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:28,769
Okay, are you dead yet?

1138
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:30,968
You're dead!

1139
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:32,977
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

1140
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:36,276
I still don't understand it, but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1141
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:53,662
Clem!

1142
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,965
Clem!

1143
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:13,885
Jo... Joely?

1144
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:16,080
Are you okay, Joel?

1145
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:18,419
Joel? Joel?

1146
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:21,358
Oh, my God. That was terrible.

1147
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:23,361
- Okay, okay. - That was like three seconds.

1148
01:14:23,429 --> 01:14:27,331
- All right. Let me do it one more time. - One more, then I get to go.

1149
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,335
Okay.

1150
01:14:38,077 --> 01:14:40,238
- Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Whoo!

1151
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:42,644
- Look at this. - This is so cool!

1152
01:14:42,715 --> 01:14:44,876
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1153
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:47,919
Ah!

1154
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:49,978
- Shit! - It's fluff.

1155
01:14:51,557 --> 01:14:53,548
Our house!

1156
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,055
- Come on. Whoo-hoo! - Come on.

1157
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,063
Come on. We gotta go!

1158
01:14:59,131 --> 01:15:01,725
Whoo!

1159
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:03,792
Come on!

1160
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,770
We gotta go. Clem?

1161
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:09,740
We gotta go.

1162
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:11,709
Aah! Come on!

1163
01:15:11,777 --> 01:15:13,972
- No! - This is a really bad time for this!

1164
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:16,981
Get off me! Oh, God!

1165
01:15:17,049 --> 01:15:19,984
- I don't even know where we're going. - It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1166
01:15:20,052 --> 01:15:22,577
- It's the best place. No, this way. - No, this way.

1167
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:27,285
No, no, no. This way, come on. You're no help at all.

1168
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,089
What's wrong with you?

1169
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:33,325
Let go of me, Joel!

1170
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:46,971
I like watching you work, Howard.

1171
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,574
I guess, uh...

1172
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:56,450
I guess I'll go out for... for some air,

1173
01:15:56,522 --> 01:15:58,513
if nobody minds.

1174
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,788
It looks like you have everything under control here.

1175
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:03,795
Yeah, that's, uh...

1176
01:16:03,863 --> 01:16:05,797
that's fine.

1177
01:16:15,508 --> 01:16:18,500
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1178
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:21,512
What do you mean?

1179
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,276
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?

1180
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,511
I find reading them inspirational,

1181
01:16:26,585 --> 01:16:30,487
and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.

1182
01:16:30,556 --> 01:16:34,219
Oh, well, I... I'd love to hear some.

1183
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,727
There's one that goes,

1184
01:16:36,796 --> 01:16:40,288
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

1185
01:16:40,366 --> 01:16:42,300
- That's Nietzsche, right? - Yeah.

1186
01:16:42,368 --> 01:16:45,360
- And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know. - Oh, no.

1187
01:16:45,437 --> 01:16:48,565
It's... It's a good quote. I'm happy we both know it.

1188
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:51,633
Yeah. Oh, and there's this other one I like.

1189
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,543
It's by Pope Alexander and it goes...

1190
01:16:54,613 --> 01:16:57,081
- Alexander Pope? - Oh, yeah.

1191
01:16:57,149 --> 01:16:59,083
Yeah, shit.

1192
01:16:59,151 --> 01:17:02,985
It's just that I told myself not to say "Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

1193
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:05,046
and then I go ahead and say it.

1194
01:17:05,124 --> 01:17:08,651
- It's no big deal. - You're such a sweetheart.

1195
01:17:10,496 --> 01:17:14,432
The quote goes, "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot?

1196
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:18,762
"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.

1197
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:23,172
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

1198
01:17:23,242 --> 01:17:26,803
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned."

1199
01:17:26,879 --> 01:17:31,839
I want to be a great big, huge elephant...

1200
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:34,385
with a huge trunk like that.

1201
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:38,723
Clem? Clementine?

1202
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:41,760
I haven't heard that one. It's lovely.

1203
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:44,796
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.

1204
01:17:49,468 --> 01:17:53,131
I really admire the work you do, Howard.

1205
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:55,696
- I don't mean to be so familiar. - Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1206
01:17:55,774 --> 01:17:58,299
I-I-I-I-I... I'm happy to hear...

1207
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:05,073
I'm sorry.

1208
01:18:09,121 --> 01:18:11,453
I've loved you for a very long time.

1209
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:17,059
- I shouldn't have said that. - Oh, Mary, no.

1210
01:18:17,129 --> 01:18:20,360
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1211
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:24,129
But I... You know, I have a wife and kids.

1212
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:26,137
You know I have a wife and kids.

1213
01:18:26,205 --> 01:18:28,139
Oh, Mary.

1214
01:18:30,276 --> 01:18:33,143
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1215
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:45,146
Oh, whoa.

1216
01:18:49,595 --> 01:18:52,860
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1217
01:19:00,272 --> 01:19:02,263
- What? - Oh, my God!

1218
01:19:02,341 --> 01:19:04,866
Who is it?

1219
01:19:09,281 --> 01:19:11,647
Uh...

1220
01:19:17,323 --> 01:19:20,554
Thank you, Stan. Thanks a lot.

1221
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:27,322
Hollis. Hollis!

1222
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,833
Hollis!

1223
01:19:29,902 --> 01:19:32,063
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hollis.

1224
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:35,863
- I knew it, Howard. - Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.

1225
01:19:35,941 --> 01:19:39,308
I came here to work. Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1226
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:41,846
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush! - Yeah.

1227
01:19:41,914 --> 01:19:44,405
I swear I basically forced him into it!

1228
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:48,245
Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the girl.

1229
01:19:50,923 --> 01:19:53,653
Tell me what?

1230
01:19:53,726 --> 01:19:55,717
Oh, you poor kid.

1231
01:19:56,729 --> 01:19:58,822
You can have him.

1232
01:19:58,897 --> 01:20:00,831
You did.

1233
01:20:09,341 --> 01:20:11,332
What?

1234
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:17,138
Oh, uh,

1235
01:20:22,154 --> 01:20:25,749
we have a history.

1236
01:20:25,824 --> 01:20:28,384
I'm sorry. Y-You wanted the procedure.

1237
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,621
You...

1238
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:33,187
You wanted it done...

1239
01:20:33,265 --> 01:20:36,564
so you could get past, uh...

1240
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,261
You could... Yeah.

1241
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:46,700
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.

1242
01:20:46,779 --> 01:20:48,770
It's almost morning.

1243
01:20:49,982 --> 01:20:51,973
We'll talk later.

1244
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:54,919
Okay?

1245
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:07,832
Hey.

1246
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:13,761
Let me give you a lift home.

1247
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:25,908
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1248
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:29,579
- Hi. - Hi.

1249
01:21:29,655 --> 01:21:33,591
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.

1250
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:36,890
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.

1251
01:21:36,962 --> 01:21:38,930
You did run away, after all.

1252
01:21:38,997 --> 01:21:41,761
I just needed to see ya.

1253
01:21:41,834 --> 01:21:44,132
Yeah?

1254
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,933
I'd like to, um,

1255
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:49,974
take you out or something.

1256
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:52,602
You're married.

1257
01:21:52,678 --> 01:21:55,112
Not yet. Not married.

1258
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,114
No, I'm not married, no.

1259
01:21:57,182 --> 01:22:00,208
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1260
01:22:00,285 --> 01:22:04,847
so, I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage...

1261
01:22:04,923 --> 01:22:07,255
or whatever it is you've got going there.

1262
01:22:07,326 --> 01:22:10,454
If you wanna be with me, you're with me.

1263
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:12,690
Okay.

1264
01:22:12,764 --> 01:22:15,665
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them,

1265
01:22:15,734 --> 01:22:18,532
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1266
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:22,233
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1267
01:22:22,307 --> 01:22:26,971
- Don't assign me yours. - I remember that speech really well.

1268
01:22:27,045 --> 01:22:30,537
- I had you pegged, didn't I? - You had the whole human race pegged.

1269
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:32,607
Hmm. Probably.

1270
01:22:34,786 --> 01:22:37,084
I still thought you were gonna save my life,

1271
01:22:37,156 --> 01:22:39,090
even after that.

1272
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:42,559
Mmm. I know.

1273
01:22:44,897 --> 01:22:46,888
It would be different...

1274
01:22:48,033 --> 01:22:50,433
if we could just give it another go around.

1275
01:22:54,406 --> 01:22:56,772
Remember me.

1276
01:22:56,842 --> 01:22:58,833
Try your best.

1277
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,114
Maybe we can.

1278
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:37,314
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

1279
01:23:37,382 --> 01:23:39,976
and, uh, then we'll take it from there.

1280
01:23:40,052 --> 01:23:42,282
Okay.

1281
01:23:42,354 --> 01:23:45,255
I liked you immediately.

1282
01:23:45,324 --> 01:23:47,815
You didn't come on to me at all.

1283
01:23:47,893 --> 01:23:50,885
I liked that.

1284
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:53,932
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

1285
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:56,661
I wanted you to think I was smart.

1286
01:23:57,869 --> 01:24:00,201
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1287
01:24:00,272 --> 01:24:03,764
I had these fantasies of us being married...

1288
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:07,209
and having kids and... just...

1289
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:09,975
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1290
01:24:10,048 --> 01:24:12,642
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1291
01:24:12,718 --> 01:24:15,186
Yeah, I know.

1292
01:24:15,254 --> 01:24:17,188
Oh, God.

1293
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:19,015
- I'll take the bottom and you... - Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1294
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:21,025
- I can take that. - So you want me to carry that?

1295
01:24:21,093 --> 01:24:23,584
- Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? - Honey, the cooler is...

1296
01:24:23,663 --> 01:24:26,257
- That's light, huh? - You can get it. - Oh, I can get that.

1297
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:28,266
No, no, no, no!

1298
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:30,495
- Don't take anything. - I can take the plane.

1299
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:33,561
Put the thing up. Put the gate back up.

1300
01:24:35,808 --> 01:24:38,538
This is the day we met.

1301
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:41,808
You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance.

1302
01:24:41,881 --> 01:24:44,008
I remember being drawn to you even then.

1303
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:48,213
I thought, "Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back."

1304
01:24:49,989 --> 01:24:53,152
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well...

1305
01:24:53,225 --> 01:24:55,193
and even hate, eventually.

1306
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:59,254
At the time I thought, "How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1307
01:24:59,331 --> 01:25:02,061
Hi there.

1308
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:04,068
Hi.

1309
01:25:04,136 --> 01:25:07,071
I saw you sitting over here...

1310
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:09,073
by yourself,

1311
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:12,042
and I thought, "Thank God.

1312
01:25:12,111 --> 01:25:14,909
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."

1313
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,107
Yeah.

1314
01:25:17,183 --> 01:25:20,209
I don't ever know what to say.

1315
01:25:20,286 --> 01:25:23,016
I'm Clementine.

1316
01:25:23,089 --> 01:25:26,252
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1317
01:25:26,325 --> 01:25:28,555
And then you just took it...

1318
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:31,152
without waiting for an answer.

1319
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:37,191
It was so intimate,

1320
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:40,397
like we were already lovers.

1321
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:43,271
I'm Joel.

1322
01:25:43,342 --> 01:25:45,503
Hi, Joel.

1323
01:25:45,578 --> 01:25:48,809
So, no jokes about my name.

1324
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:49,900
You mean like...

1325
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine

1326
01:25:53,419 --> 01:25:55,910
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?

1327
01:25:55,988 --> 01:25:58,013
Yeah. Like that.

1328
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:00,024
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1329
01:26:00,092 --> 01:26:03,823
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1330
01:26:03,896 --> 01:26:05,887
Oh.

1331
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,165
I think your name is magical.

1332
01:26:13,072 --> 01:26:15,370
This is it, Joel.

1333
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:17,636
It's gonna be gone soon.

1334
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:22,111
I know.

1335
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:24,115
What do we do?

1336
01:26:26,519 --> 01:26:29,010
Enjoy it.

1337
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:47,969
- You married? - No.

1338
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,668
Let's move into this neighborhood!

1339
01:26:50,743 --> 01:26:52,643
I do sort of live with someone though.

1340
01:26:52,711 --> 01:26:56,078
- Male or female? - What?

1341
01:26:56,148 --> 01:26:58,582
Female. Female.

1342
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,211
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.

1343
01:27:06,992 --> 01:27:10,985
- You know these people? - No, of course not. Come on.

1344
01:27:11,997 --> 01:27:13,931
They might have a dog.

1345
01:27:13,999 --> 01:27:17,662
There's no dog.

1346
01:27:17,736 --> 01:27:19,727
What are you doing?

1347
01:27:19,805 --> 01:27:23,070
- It's freezing out. - I can't believe this.

1348
01:27:23,142 --> 01:27:26,111
Hoo-hoo!

1349
01:27:26,178 --> 01:27:30,012
- Clementine! - There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1350
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:39,349
Come on, man. The water's fine.

1351
01:27:39,425 --> 01:27:42,553
Nobody's coming here tonight. Believe me.

1352
01:27:45,297 --> 01:27:47,231
It's dark.

1353
01:27:47,299 --> 01:27:51,292
So, uh, what's your girlfriend's name?

1354
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:54,601
Naomi, but we're not really... I mean...

1355
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:57,073
- We're... - Whatever.

1356
01:27:57,142 --> 01:28:01,238
So, this is great. Now I can look for, um, candles, matches...

1357
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:03,781
and the liquor cabinet.

1358
01:28:03,849 --> 01:28:06,349
Oh, my God.

1359
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:13,290
I think we should go.

1360
01:28:13,376 --> 01:28:15,970
There's no phone line. What?

1361
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:18,556
- I think we should go. - Why?

1362
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,124
It's our house... just for tonight.

1363
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,169
We are "David and Ruth Laskin".

1364
01:28:25,304 --> 01:28:27,738
- Which one do you want to be? - Uh...

1365
01:28:27,806 --> 01:28:31,298
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.

1366
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:36,144
What are you do...

1367
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:38,445
- Alcohol! - Oh, boy.

1368
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,111
So, are you okay with wine?

1369
01:28:41,186 --> 01:28:43,848
- I don't know. - Well, you choose the wine.

1370
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:48,155
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more... Ruth.

1371
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:54,327
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment. - I really should go.

1372
01:28:56,068 --> 01:28:59,196
I've gotta catch my ride.

1373
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,531
So go.

1374
01:29:03,609 --> 01:29:05,702
I did.

1375
01:29:05,778 --> 01:29:08,645
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1376
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:11,512
but you were exciting.

1377
01:29:12,618 --> 01:29:14,552
I wish you'd stayed.

1378
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:17,316
I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed.

1379
01:29:17,389 --> 01:29:20,449
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1380
01:29:20,526 --> 01:29:22,858
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1381
01:29:26,832 --> 01:29:29,960
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1382
01:29:30,035 --> 01:29:34,597
- Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone. - I walked out. I walked out the door.

1383
01:29:34,673 --> 01:29:37,506
- Why? - I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1384
01:29:37,576 --> 01:29:40,909
I was like... It was above my head. I don't know.

1385
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,914
You were scared?

1386
01:29:42,982 --> 01:29:44,916
Yeah.

1387
01:29:45,951 --> 01:29:48,579
Thought you knew that about me.

1388
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:52,647
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1389
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:56,354
- Was it something I said? - Yeah.

1390
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:01,531
You said, "So go"...

1391
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,068
with such disdain, you know?

1392
01:30:04,136 --> 01:30:06,764
- Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1393
01:30:12,344 --> 01:30:14,278
Joely?

1394
01:30:14,346 --> 01:30:17,213
What if you stayed this time?

1395
01:30:19,885 --> 01:30:22,513
I walked out the door.

1396
01:30:22,588 --> 01:30:24,522
There's no memory left.

1397
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:27,718
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

1398
01:30:27,793 --> 01:30:29,727
Let's pretend we had one.

1399
01:30:40,839 --> 01:30:43,330
Bye, Joel.

1400
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:45,343
I love you.

1401
01:30:45,411 --> 01:30:49,677
Meet me in Montauk.

1402
01:30:53,352 --> 01:30:57,550
I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1403
01:30:57,623 --> 01:31:01,719
You were operating the plane with the remote control, and then it crashed.

1404
01:31:01,794 --> 01:31:04,126
It was fucking windy. Come on, man.

1405
01:31:04,196 --> 01:31:06,164
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1406
01:31:06,231 --> 01:31:08,791
Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up.

1407
01:31:08,867 --> 01:31:11,392
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.

1408
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:15,099
It does. That's a medical fact.

1409
01:31:15,174 --> 01:31:17,608
It was proven on the Science Network.

1410
01:31:17,676 --> 01:31:20,110
- Honey, just watch the road. - I can't see shit.

1411
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:25,673
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1412
01:31:25,751 --> 01:31:28,584
- She was nice. - Yeah, man. Who was that?

1413
01:31:30,689 --> 01:31:33,988
She was, um, just a girl.

1414
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,367
Okay.

1415
01:32:19,372 --> 01:32:22,136
So I gotta... I gotta drop the van off.

1416
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,301
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1417
01:32:24,377 --> 01:32:27,710
We'll talk.

1418
01:33:45,725 --> 01:33:47,716
Hey!

1419
01:33:48,794 --> 01:33:50,728
Hey.

1420
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:54,928
- You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. - Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1421
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,436
I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1422
01:33:58,504 --> 01:34:02,235
- Do you swear you didn't know? - I-I swear.

1423
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:05,903
- So you didn't do the erasing? - Of course not. God, no.

1424
01:34:05,978 --> 01:34:08,173
And you never even suspected we were together?

1425
01:34:08,247 --> 01:34:12,479
Once, maybe.

1426
01:34:12,551 --> 01:34:15,543
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.

1427
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:18,215
I saw you two talking.

1428
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:22,021
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.

1429
01:34:22,094 --> 01:34:24,392
How'd I look?

1430
01:34:25,831 --> 01:34:27,765
You looked happy.

1431
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:30,097
Happy with a secret.

1432
01:34:31,504 --> 01:34:33,438
And after that?

1433
01:34:33,506 --> 01:34:36,669
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just...

1434
01:34:36,742 --> 01:34:40,439
I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things.

1435
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:02,391
Montauk train now boarding on track B. All aboard.

1436
01:35:05,237 --> 01:35:07,728
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1437
01:35:08,908 --> 01:35:11,206
You know that?

1438
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:23,221
Thanks.

1439
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:58,949
Let me get my toothbrush.

1440
01:35:59,024 --> 01:36:01,492
Yeah. Just...

1441
01:36:14,106 --> 01:36:16,666
Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1442
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:21,111
I feel like you're mad at me, and I don't know what I did.

1443
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,944
What did I do?

1444
01:36:24,016 --> 01:36:26,484
I love you so much.

1445
01:36:26,552 --> 01:36:28,543
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1446
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:30,885
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.

1447
01:36:30,956 --> 01:36:34,722
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.

1448
01:36:34,793 --> 01:36:36,727
Oh. Whew.

1449
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:50,736
Vámonos, señor.

1450
01:36:50,809 --> 01:36:53,972
I-I had a really nice time last night.

1451
01:36:54,046 --> 01:36:56,674
Nice?

1452
01:36:56,749 --> 01:36:59,980
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...

1453
01:37:00,052 --> 01:37:01,986
last night.

1454
01:37:01,554 --> 01:37:03,545
That's better.

1455
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:10,857
- This is weird. - To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1456
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:14,422
- My name is Mary Svevo. - "We've met, but you don't remember me.

1457
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:18,937
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."

1458
01:37:19,005 --> 01:37:21,530
- I have since decided that this is a horrible... - Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1459
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:26,169
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1460
01:37:26,245 --> 01:37:29,840
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1461
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:32,646
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1462
01:37:32,718 --> 01:37:34,948
- What is this? - I don't know.

1463
01:37:35,021 --> 01:37:39,617
He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1464
01:37:39,692 --> 01:37:43,389
I've been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now,

1465
01:37:43,463 --> 01:37:45,397
and it's like he changed me.

1466
01:37:45,465 --> 01:37:49,231
I feel like I'm always pissy now. I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1467
01:37:49,302 --> 01:37:53,898
I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1468
01:37:53,973 --> 01:37:57,170
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know? - What are you doing?

1469
01:37:57,243 --> 01:37:59,677
- I'm not doing anything. - The bloom is certainly fucking off the rose at this point.

1470
01:37:59,745 --> 01:38:02,737
- Are you screwing with me? - No!

1471
01:38:02,815 --> 01:38:05,249
- You are screwing with me. - Joel, I'm not!

1472
01:38:05,318 --> 01:38:09,687
- You clearly are. - Look, let's just take a minute and...

1473
01:38:38,351 --> 01:38:40,285
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1474
01:38:40,353 --> 01:38:42,753
- Oh, sweetheart... - Get the fuck away from me!

1475
01:38:42,822 --> 01:38:46,053
- Can we talk about it? - No! Get the fuck away!

1476
01:39:18,324 --> 01:39:20,588
Joel Barish.

1477
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:23,424
- Hey, Clementine. - Hey.

1478
01:39:23,496 --> 01:39:26,727
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1479
01:39:27,733 --> 01:39:29,667
Yeah.

1480
01:39:29,735 --> 01:39:31,726
Really very educated.

1481
01:39:31,804 --> 01:39:35,240
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1482
01:39:35,308 --> 01:39:38,209
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?

1483
01:39:38,277 --> 01:39:41,713
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1484
01:39:41,781 --> 01:39:45,182
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.

1485
01:39:45,251 --> 01:39:47,913
Sometimes... I was embarrassed in public...

1486
01:39:47,987 --> 01:39:49,978
- Hi. - because she would pronounce...

1487
01:39:50,056 --> 01:39:52,820
- library "libary". - Hi.

1488
01:39:52,892 --> 01:39:56,020
Libary. Libary.

1489
01:39:56,095 --> 01:39:58,029
Look what I found.

1490
01:39:58,097 --> 01:40:02,431
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine,

1491
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:06,164
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.

1492
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,872
You made me look skinny.

1493
01:40:09,942 --> 01:40:12,502
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1494
01:40:12,578 --> 01:40:16,878
will carry you to another world where things are exciting.

1495
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:19,975
But what you quickly learn is that...

1496
01:40:20,052 --> 01:40:22,885
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1497
01:40:22,955 --> 01:40:24,946
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1498
01:40:26,559 --> 01:40:29,289
- It's okay. - So flashy in a kind of obvious way.

1499
01:40:30,997 --> 01:40:33,557
- But still, it seduces you. - Joel, I really like you.

1500
01:40:33,633 --> 01:40:35,863
I hate that I said mean things about you.

1501
01:40:35,935 --> 01:40:40,395
- Let me turn this off, okay? - Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1502
01:40:41,741 --> 01:40:43,709
Where's the real Clementine?

1503
01:40:43,776 --> 01:40:46,904
I mean, the whole thing with the hair... it's all bullshit.

1504
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:52,012
- I really like your hair. - Thank you.

1505
01:40:52,084 --> 01:40:54,018
- I do. - The world's a goddamn mess.

1506
01:40:54,086 --> 01:40:57,715
- Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color. - You want a drink or something?

1507
01:40:57,790 --> 01:41:00,520
Do you have any whiskey?

1508
01:41:00,593 --> 01:41:05,895
No, I don't think her sex is... motivated.

1509
01:41:05,965 --> 01:41:08,957
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.

1510
01:41:09,035 --> 01:41:12,436
It wasn't sex. It was just sad.

1511
01:41:12,505 --> 01:41:15,565
Hey. Sorry. I thought there was more.

1512
01:41:15,641 --> 01:41:19,304
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her...

1513
01:41:19,378 --> 01:41:22,211
is to fuck 'em...

1514
01:41:22,281 --> 01:41:26,513
or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of 'em.

1515
01:41:26,585 --> 01:41:29,520
And she's so desperate and insecure...

1516
01:41:29,588 --> 01:41:34,423
that she'll, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.

1517
01:41:34,493 --> 01:41:37,519
- I don't do that. - I wouldn't think that about you.

1518
01:41:37,596 --> 01:41:40,497
- Because I don't. - I know.

1519
01:41:40,566 --> 01:41:43,797
- Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that. - I'm so sorry.

1520
01:41:43,869 --> 01:41:46,963
I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

1521
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:51,840
I'm a little confused. I don't really think I can be here.

1522
01:41:55,981 --> 01:41:59,644
Um... bye.

1523
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:02,347
- Bye. - I thought I knew her so well.

1524
01:42:02,421 --> 01:42:06,016
- It was nice meeting you and all. - But I don't know her at all.

1525
01:42:07,326 --> 01:42:10,693
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,

1526
01:42:10,763 --> 01:42:14,665
only to find out that she's a stranger.

1527
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:19,961
Wait.

1528
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,574
- What? - I don't know.

1529
01:42:23,642 --> 01:42:25,803
- Just wait. Just wait. - What do you want, Joel?

1530
01:42:25,878 --> 01:42:30,406
I don't know. I want you to wait for... just a... while.

1531
01:42:43,963 --> 01:42:46,659
- Okay. - Really?

1532
01:42:46,732 --> 01:42:50,862
I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1533
01:42:50,936 --> 01:42:54,872
- I'm not perfect. - I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

1534
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:57,636
- Right now I can't. - But you will. But you will.

1535
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:01,339
You know, you will think of things, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped...

1536
01:43:01,413 --> 01:43:03,472
because that's what happens with me.

1537
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,884
Okay.

1538
01:43:10,589 --> 01:43:12,580
Okay.

1539
01:43:16,695 --> 01:43:19,858
- Okay. - Okay.

1540
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:30,383
Change your heart

1541
01:43:33,231 --> 01:43:36,192
Look around you

1542
01:43:42,061 --> 01:43:45,192
Change your heart

1543
01:43:47,298 --> 01:43:50,660
It will astound you

1544
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:59,235
Now, I need your lovin'

1545
01:44:01,282 --> 01:44:06,948
Like the sunshine

1546
01:44:09,362 --> 01:44:13,827
And everybody's gotta learn sometime

1547
01:44:16,593 --> 01:44:21,244
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1548
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:28,027
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
