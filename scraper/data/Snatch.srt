My parents to be were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

They named me after
the name of the plane.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,464
Not many people are

He tells people
he was named after a gun.

8
00:00:56,303 --> 00:01:01,015
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.

Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

10

Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

11

out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

MUTTI:
It's just that. Just a story.

31
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:13,295

MUTTI: Listen to this. Are you
busy? I'll tell you the whole story.

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,264
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"

35
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,683
into the Greek word
for "virgin. "

36
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,352
It was an easy mistake
to make

37
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:33,148
because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

38
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,327
So, they came up
with a prophecy:

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,748
"Behold, the virgin shall
conceive and bear us a son. "

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:54,128
You understand this? It was the word
"virgin" that caught people's attention.

41
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,507
It's not every day a virgin
conceives and bears a son.
