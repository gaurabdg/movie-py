1
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,300
2306, please.

2
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,500
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,500
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
and then I'll...
I would if I could.

7
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,400
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I...

8
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,700
let me get off and I prom...
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,600
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,600
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,300
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,900
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today...

14
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,200
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,800
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,100
- and he has certain parcels...
- Doctor...

19
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
well, could you get...
what do you mean?

20
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,000
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,400
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,600
He has certain parcels...
certain choice parcels

24
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,200
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,200
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Okay.

28
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,900
Look, you sent in the...
no, no, listen to me now...

30
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,700
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,400
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,600
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,800
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,200
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,300
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,900
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,100
You never know... I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,700
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,600
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,500
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
You're on an override...
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,900
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,600
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,100
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,000
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,100
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,300
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing...

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,600
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead...

60
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,700
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm in a bind...
personal problems.

62
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
- I hear the new Glengarry leads...
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,600
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,300
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,800
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,100
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,900
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,200
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,800
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,500
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,400
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,700
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,200
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,100
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,700
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,900
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,300
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,600
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,700
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook...

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
five units, Mountain View...
what happens?

88
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,700
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,300
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,900
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,100
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,600
- They won't give out...
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,300
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
Who belongs
to the BM?

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
So who is that?

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,900
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,100
You're talking about what?
You're talking about...

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,500
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,300
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,100
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,600
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,600
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,000
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,900
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,700
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,100
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
The bad news is you've got...
all of you've got...

123
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,200
starting with tonight...
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,100
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Good...

127
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,200
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,500
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,400
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,800
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,100
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,600
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,500
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,900
- What's your name?
- Fuck you...

143
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,500
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,700
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,600
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,000
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,200
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,700
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,500
Because only one thing
counts in this life...

150
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,900
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,900
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
A... Always,
B... Be, C... Closing.

154
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,400
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Attention...
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,700
Interest...
Are you interested?

160
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,000
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,400
Decision... Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,100
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,500
Get out there...
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,700
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,900
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Crap.

171
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,300
What's the problem, pal?
You... Moss.

172
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,800
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,100
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
You see this watch?

175
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,500
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,600
I made $970,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,000
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,900
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Good father? Fuck you...
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,600
You want to work here...
close!

182
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,900
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,100
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,800
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,400
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,800
I can go out there tonight...
the materials you got...

187
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,900
make myself $15,000.
Tonight... in two hours!

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Can you?

189
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,600
Can you?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,300
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,000
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,400
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
The money's out there...
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,200
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,100
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close...

198
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,900
close... it's yours.

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,100
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,900
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,800
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,000
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,100
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,900
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,700
Why?

207
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
They're for closers.

209
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,600
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,900
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,100
And to answer your question, pal...
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,900
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor...

214
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,500
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

217
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
treat people like that.

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,300
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,700
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,900
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,200
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,100
I think... I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,000
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,000
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Thank you.

231
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,200
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,200
- As of tonight...
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,500
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray...

235
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,300
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,500
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,800
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,000
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,200
- Next man down the...
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,600
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,500
They're old...
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,800
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,600
The new leads...
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,200
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,700
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,400
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,600
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,100
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,000
I suggest you... those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,900
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,800
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,000
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,800
I... I can't...
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Shelly, how am I
supposed to...

262
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,300
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,900
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,300
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,900
I have some rather...
rather unusual,

271
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,200
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,600
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,300
Please listen closely...
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,500
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,900
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,700
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,900
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,200
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,900
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,700
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,300
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
They're ancient...
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,000
Get some jerk
to come in here...

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,300
Send a guy out there...
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,000
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,600
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma... fuck Roma.

296
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Had a freak...
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,300
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,600
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,300
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,300
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,800
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,900
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,500
Life.

308
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,800
I swear to God,
you work all your life...

309
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,000
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,500
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,100
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,900
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,800
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,200
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,000
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,600
- Nope.
- All this garbage...

317
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,600
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,400
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,000
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,000
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,100
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,400
he's got that list...
with the nurses?

327
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,400
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,100
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,500
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,700
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
For the leads... that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,000
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Who... who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,200
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,800
Nurses.

338
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,500
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

339
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,700
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,800
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,800
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,500
All that shit. Somebody told me...
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,400
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,800
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,700
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,200
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,400
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,700
You can't sell to a void...
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,300
You get a lead, you get
a person... I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,200
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,300
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Yeah, we spoke...
last May I called you.

361
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,700
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and...

362
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,500
Arizona.

363
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value...

365
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,900
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

366
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,100
Look, I'm here overnight...
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,000
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that...

369
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,000
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,100
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
and make sure...
oh, gee, I wish that...

372
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,300
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,200
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,500
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,700
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,200
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,600
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,100
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

381
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,700
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,400
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract...

384
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,100
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,400
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,000
You got the new leads.
If you would give me... just hold on.

389
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,900
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,700
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads...

391
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,100
No, no... hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,800
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,800
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,600
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,200
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,100
Shelly...

398
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,000
I pray you never find it...
it runs in streaks.

400
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,000
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does... streaks.

401
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,700
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,700
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson...

403
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,000
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,700
1987, '88, '89...
six months in '89... who's on top?

405
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,300
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,100
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,800
April to September it's me...
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,900
Talk... talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late...

411
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,600
Well, lately...
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,400
You call Murray and you call Mitch...
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,100
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,300
He came in here...
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,300
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,600
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,200
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,600
I can't get a lead, you...
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,100
It could be working for you...
you want to throw it away.

420
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
- It isn't me.
- It's not you...

421
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,000
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,800
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,100
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,900
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,700
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:27,600
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,400
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I do what I'm hired to do...
you might do the same.

429
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,500
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,100
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,500
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,100
You give me
one premium lead...

438
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,900
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,700
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,000
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Christ, I saw these back...
Homestead...

445
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,200
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,500
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,500
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,300
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,600
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,900
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,900
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
John...

453
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,800
- Of what?
- My end... what I close.

455
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,800
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,000
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
- You see what I'm saying?
- John...

461
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,100
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,900
Now, 10% John...
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,600
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist... fuck it!

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,300
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said...

467
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,800
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,300
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,300
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,800
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,700
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,100
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,900
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,200
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,700
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,600
John, a good deal... has got to be
one where both parties...

479
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Okay, okay, okay, fine...
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,900
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,600
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,300
and I want the good leads...
the Glengarry leads... two.

483
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,500
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,100
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,000
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,800
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,400
What?

491
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,200
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,400
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,700
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,500
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,900
I don't have it...
I don't...

496
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,300
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,900
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,300
All right, here's...

500
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,300
20... 30, and...

501
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,900
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,100
No.

504
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,100
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,200
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray... I got your job.

507
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,700
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,500
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,300
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Give me... I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,500
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly...

514
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,800
I promise you,
I've been on the phone... I know.

515
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,500
No more leads today...
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
All right.

517
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,800
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,700
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,600
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,000
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,300
- To get on the...
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,500
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,200
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,500
These names come up...
you ever get 'em..."Patel"?

529
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,900
You had one,
you'd know it..."Patel."

531
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,700
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,100
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,900
They like to feel superior...
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,500
I don't know.
Come down the line...

535
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,100
doctors, lawyers, Indians...
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,600
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,500
You go in the door... I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,300
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,700
Remember when we were... when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,100
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,300
- They came in...
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,700
- We're stuck with this...
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,800
- It is.
- You get a bad month...

546
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,300
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,800
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,200
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,300
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,100
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Guys come in..."Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,500
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life...

555
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,400
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots...

556
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,000
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,000
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,400
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,200
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,300
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,400
Come in.

564
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,800
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,500
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,400
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself... many years.

568
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,300
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,100
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference?

571
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,100
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,400
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,700
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization...

575
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,500
my representatives in this area...
and Mr. Spannel...

576
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,400
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,200
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,400
and he made me...
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,000
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan...

580
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,600
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,200
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,400
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,400
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,700
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,000
you go to a man...
has invested in the past...

588
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,900
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him... rebate.

589
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,100
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,700
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you...

592
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,200
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,000
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,000
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,600
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,900
- Mister...
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,200
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,300
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the...

599
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,700
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,900
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,600
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,300
- I'm on a plane to Florida...
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,900
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,600
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,400
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,100
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,000
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,000
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,600
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,000
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,900
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,800
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year...

615
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,800
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,700
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,800
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,700
- Roma, man... he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,200
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,700
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,600
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,700
If they bounce you with no
confidence...

623
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,400
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,200
If they get you
on a bad beat...

625
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,700
and you got to go out there,
get a new job...

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
- With no...
- With no confidence...

627
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
Yes.

628
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,500
I'll tell you what the hard part is...
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,000
You say the Nazis
in Europe...
"If they came in my door"...

630
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,900
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker...

632
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,000
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say... fuck you!

634
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,900
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,800
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
Yes.

637
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,400
And I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,100
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,900
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,700
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
This is the difference...
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,600
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:56,300
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I'll tell you... I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
What?

646
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,600
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,900
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,800
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,500
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,300
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,600
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,100
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,300
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,200
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,300
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,700
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,500
I'd really like to get it
off the books before...

663
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,600
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,200
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,500
Now, I'm in town only for...
well, let me see.

666
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,200
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,800
As I said,
I could swing by tonight...

669
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,400
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,000
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,300
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,600
And put me
on the telex hookup... yes?

674
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,200
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,700
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,900
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,000
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,200
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,700
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,400
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,500
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,900
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,700
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,400
And then what?

688
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,000
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,100
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:26,500
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
That's me.

693
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,200
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,900
- Did I?
- Yes.

695
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,500
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,800
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,600
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,000
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
keeps us going...
it's only food.

700
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,100
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,100
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,800
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,300
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,800
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,300
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,300
Or it's me in the...
I'm telling you...

708
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,300
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me caf au lait,

709
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,800
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,400
Eh?

711
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,900
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,300
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,200
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,800
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,300
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,300
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,500
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,100
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,300
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,500
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,300
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,500
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,900
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,100
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,500
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,800
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying... yeah.

730
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,500
A guy could take...
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,100
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,600
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,300
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,500
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,900
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,400
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,500
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,400
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,200
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,900
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,700
So all this...
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,300
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,600
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,300
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,100
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,800
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,200
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,900
It is a crime.

750
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,400
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,200
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,700
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,600
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,300
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,200
What did he say?

756
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,500
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,500
You're gonna steal...

758
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,700
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,900
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,200
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,900
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,900
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,800
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,100
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,000
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,600
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,800
Hello?

770
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,300
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,100
Sheldon Levene.
She's in...

772
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,700
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But... where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,300
They canceled her...
well, let me talk...

774
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,400
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,400
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,600
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,000
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,200
Yes.

781
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,700
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,100
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward...

783
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,800
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,500
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,600
What?

787
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,900
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,200
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,000
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,000
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,800
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,500
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,000
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,700
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,900
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,400
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,200
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,400
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,800
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,900
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,900
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,200
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,100
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,300
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,700
Yes?

807
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,800
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,200
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,800
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,400
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,200
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,700
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
Let me ask you this...
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,700
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,800
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,600
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,700
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,600
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,300
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,400
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,100
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught...

823
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,000
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,900
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,100
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,700
Are you going to give me $7,500?

827
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,000
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,100
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,100
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,900
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,000
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,900
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,900
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,600
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,200
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,900
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,200
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,100
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,700
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,700
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,600
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,300
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,500
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have...

846
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,600
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,000
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,000
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,900
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,700
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,400
Things. Things.

852
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,800
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,500
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,000
You can't do it.

855
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,500
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,900
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,400
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,900
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,100
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,100
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,800
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,700
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,800
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,000
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,000
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,900
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,700
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,500
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,100
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,800
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,700
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,800
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,000
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,600
But look at this.

877
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,100
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,600
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,800
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,500
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,000
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,500
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,500
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,400
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,900
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,200
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,300
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,000
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,500
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
They got... excuse me.

891
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,600
Fuck.

892
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,400
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,400
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,600
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,200
They got... listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,900
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,300
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,000
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,600
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,000
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,700
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,900
- So far...
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,300
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,500
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,300
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,000
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,400
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,400
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,400
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,900
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,600
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,900
- I don't...
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,900
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,000
- The robbery makes difficult...
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,700
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,000
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,000
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,600
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,900
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,800
6:00 P.M. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,400
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,200
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,400
She'll remember.
Just, just... wait a minute!

926
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,800
Just to say... to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,300
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,800
Uh-huh.

930
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,800
"10:00 P.M., Octavia."

931
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,900
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,400
I... you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,900
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,500
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,200
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,100
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,400
I'm fine.

940
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,900
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,900
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,500
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't...

943
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,400
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't...

944
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,900
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,700
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,500
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,800
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,300
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,800
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,300
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,600
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,500
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,300
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,000
- He said he filed...
- He filed the big one.

955
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,200
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,800
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,800
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,500
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,100
that would sap anyone's... wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

960
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,100
- They stole...
- They stole?

961
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,600
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,500
...when criminals come and they take...
they steal the phones?

963
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,800
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,500
they stole... aw, Christ.

965
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,800
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
You think they're going to catch...
where are you going?

967
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,000
Down the street.

968
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,000
- Where are you going?
- To the... what do you fucking care?

969
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,600
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,800
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,300
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,700
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,500
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,800
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,400
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,900
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,000
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a...

978
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,200
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,600
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,100
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,100
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,600
I don't know, why?

983
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,500
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,000
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,500
That's right.

986
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,800
You're right.

987
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,600
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,200
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,300
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,100
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,100
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,000
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,700
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,600
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,200
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,800
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,900
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,000
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,000
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,100
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,400
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,600
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,300
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,000
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,400
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,500
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,100
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,600
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,500
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1011
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,500
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm...

1012
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,800
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,700
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,600
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,500
to deadbeats...
money in the mattress.

1016
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,000
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,300
I got to go out...
fuck this shit.

1018
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,200
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,300
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,600
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,600
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,000
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,600
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,100
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,400
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,800
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,600
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,600
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,300
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,600
and figure out a way
to have your ass... fuck you!

1032
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,300
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,900
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,800
Get the...
I did it... I closed 'em.

1035
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,700
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,300
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,000
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,200
- Rick... eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,600
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,800
Who wants to go to lunch...
I'm buying.

1041
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,500
Williamson... $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,900
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,600
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,100
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,300
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,100
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,400
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,300
- Shelly!
- Big deal... I broke a bad streak.

1049
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,600
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,600
Thank you, George.
Hey...

1051
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,100
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,800
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,100
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,000
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,800
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1056
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Fucking asshole.

1057
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,800
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,200
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,700
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,800
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,800
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,200
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,300
- Anybody talks to this guy...
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,700
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,800
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,000
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,500
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,100
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,400
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,100
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,500
- Guess who?
- You just... this morning?

1072
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,000
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,300
- You did that?
- Yeah... $82,000.

1074
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,000
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em... listen to this.

1075
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,200
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,700
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,200
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,100
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,700
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,300
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,900
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn...

1082
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,400
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,900
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1084
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,600
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,500
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,600
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,200
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,400
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,600
Uh-huh.

1090
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,500
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,400
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,800
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,600
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1094
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,800
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake...

1095
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,100
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,400
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,300
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,400
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,300
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,600
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,500
You bring that shit up...
on my volume?

1102
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,800
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,300
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,700
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,300
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,800
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,600
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,300
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,100
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,700
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,700
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,600
I get accused of...

1113
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,400
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,300
Is that what I did, Dave...
I humiliated you?

1115
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,900
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,800
Sitting on top of the world...
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,100
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,000
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,900
Fuck you, Dave...
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,200
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week...

1121
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,600
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,400
"Let me buy you a pack of gum...
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,600
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,600
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,000
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,100
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,800
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,300
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,900
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,900
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,100
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,500
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1134
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,400
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,000
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,500
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,500
You were saying?

1138
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,300
Huh?

1139
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,200
Come on.

1140
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,600
Come on... you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,300
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,600
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,000
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,400
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,600
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,200
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,200
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,700
and take it... and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,600
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,100
God, that's what
I've been saying... the old ways.

1151
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,700
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,700
They got their money
in government bonds...

1153
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,400
I said, "Fuck it... let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,700
I take it and plat it out... eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,900
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,800
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,400
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce...
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,600
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,000
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,500
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me... the both of us.

1162
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,800
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,500
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,600
And I mean it, that's it...
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,300
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick... hey.

1166
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,200
I turned that contract around...
that's eight units, 82 grand...

1167
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,300
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,400
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:08,900
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,800
Ricky... not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,500
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,400
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,100
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,300
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,400
Nobody ever...
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,600
No, what I did...
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,300
I locked all on them...
nothing on me... on them.

1178
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,400
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,200
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,800
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,600
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,600
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,300
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing... just together.

1184
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,500
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,200
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,400
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,700
It was solemn...
fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,800
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,300
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,600
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,600
He went over,
he brought us back a drink...

1192
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,200
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,500
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,000
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,100
Great.

1196
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,100
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,900
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,600
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,300
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,800
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele...

1202
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,200
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,200
We had a little... you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,200
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,400
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make...

1206
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,300
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,100
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,600
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,000
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,100
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,000
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,200
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar...

1214
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,100
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,600
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,800
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,500
- Did you ever sit...
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,500
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,500
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,800
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,400
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,100
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,500
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,900
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,300
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know...

1227
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,000
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,500
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
For what,
two months, three months?

1230
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,500
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,300
Luck... was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,200
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,900
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,300
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,100
Soft sell... we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,000
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,000
You wouldn't know, you cock...
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,400
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,200
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,700
That's my message to you...
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,500
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,400
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,700
Listen to me... you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,200
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,300
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,500
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,800
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,200
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,100
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,800
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,100
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,300
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,700
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,600
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1255
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,100
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,900
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,700
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,000
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,800
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:37,600
- Take your time. If you still feel...
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,800
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,300
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,600
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,700
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,700
- Are you acquainted with...
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,500
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,600
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,400
Beautiful rolling land...
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,900
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,800
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,800
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,300
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services...

1274
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted...

1275
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,300
I was at the Lingks'...

1276
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,800
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,600
- Which...
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,500
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,200
"Home cook..."
the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,400
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,900
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:35,100
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,900
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,100
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,800
His wife.

1287
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,500
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,400
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,200
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,200
Remember the 1:00... that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,400
You're right, the 1:00...
let's scoot.

1292
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,600
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,800
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle... John!

1294
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,400
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,800
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,300
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,400
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and...

1298
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,100
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,000
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,500
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,100
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,900
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,900
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray...
just a minute.

1304
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,500
Jim, I told you who he is... the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
His family owns 32 per...

1306
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,700
over the past years, I have sold him...
I can't tell you the dollar amount...

1307
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,500
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,000
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,600
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,800
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,100
It's funny... you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,600
all business...
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,600
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,800
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L. A?

1315
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,300
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,800
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,300
- My wife...
- Rick?

1318
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,600
I can't talk now, Jim...
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,000
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,300
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,200
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,100
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:32,100
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,400
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again...

1325
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,400
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,100
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,300
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,100
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law...

1329
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,500
the man next to you...
bought his lot at 42...

1330
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,300
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,900
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,300
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,100
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,800
She called the consumer...
the attorney general?

1336
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,300
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,500
The attorney ge...
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,900
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,800
I don't know.

1340
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,700
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,900
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Three days?

1343
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,100
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,800
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,800
Of course you have...
three days.

1346
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,300
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,000
Monday...
you saw my book.

1348
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,700
Jim, Jim... I can't.

1349
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,600
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,700
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,300
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,700
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business...

1354
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,800
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,000
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,700
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,200
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:09,900
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,900
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,800
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,100
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,900
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,000
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,500
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,900
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,200
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not...

1367
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,400
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,400
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,700
I just phoned downtown...
it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,000
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,800
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,900
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,300
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,400
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,700
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,700
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,500
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,400
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,500
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,700
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,200
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,600
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,600
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,600
- I didn't rob...
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,800
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,600
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,600
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,100
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,900
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,600
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,700
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,900
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,200
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,400
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,000
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,100
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,500
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:58,300
No man has the right...
no man has the right...

1400
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,500
"Call an attorney"...
that means you're under...

1401
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,500
That's not...
as long as I've...

1403
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,000
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,800
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,900
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,200
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,900
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss?

1408
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,100
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,500
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,600
I'm sorry, I...

1411
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,400
I apologize to you. It's...

1412
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,100
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,900
What is it?

1414
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,000
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again... your wife?

1416
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,200
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,700
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,300
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1420
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,700
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,600
- She...
- Roma!

1422
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,200
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,100
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,600
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,800
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,600
Listen, I do...
if I don't get my money back...

1427
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,500
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,400
Listen... will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,700
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,300
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,300
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,000
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,400
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,700
This is me!

1435
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,600
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:01,900
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,400
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,000
Something upset you.

1439
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,300
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,300
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,700
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,900
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,500
Sit down.

1444
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,100
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,000
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,600
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,400
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,800
What does that mean?

1449
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,500
What?

1450
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,300
I don't have the power.

1452
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,500
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,000
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,000
To negotiate what?

1455
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,300
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,200
This.

1457
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,300
- What this?
- The deal.

1458
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,300
The deal?

1459
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,400
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,400
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,100
What?

1462
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,800
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,300
You met my wife.

1464
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,300
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,600
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,100
What, Jim?

1467
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,500
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,800
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,100
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,000
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,700
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,800
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise...

1473
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,900
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:01,400
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,900
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,300
That's over.

1477
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,000
Please...
let's talk about you.

1478
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,400
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,800
Your life is your own.

1480
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,800
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,900
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,200
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:37,200
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,900
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,200
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,400
This is your life.

1487
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,500
Yes?

1488
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,700
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,800
and that concerns me.

1490
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,300
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,100
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,400
Roma.

1493
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,200
- What?
- The check, it's...

1494
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,900
What did I tell you?

1495
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,800
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1496
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,800
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,300
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,300
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,200
- People downtown said...
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,300
Yes?

1501
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,400
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the...

1502
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,300
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be...

1503
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,900
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,800
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,000
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,500
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,500
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John...

1508
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,300
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,300
- Mr. Williamson...
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,000
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,500
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:06,700
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,500
- Though I'm sure we can...
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,900
Christ! I...
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,400
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,600
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,000
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I...

1518
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,100
I don't...
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,200
I... forgive me.

1520
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,800
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,300
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,100
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:03,700
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,100
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:10,700
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,700
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,200
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,100
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,600
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,100
Could I?

1531
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,600
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,400
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,500
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,600
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,000
you're going out.
I swear to you...

1536
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,700
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,200
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits...

1538
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,000
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,400
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,300
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:02,200
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,500
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,000
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:10,800
You company man.

1545
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,900
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,500
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,800
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,900
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,400
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,900
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,300
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,300
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,500
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,400
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,600
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,900
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,900
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,300
Precisely.
Because your partner depends...

1559
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,300
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,500
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,000
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,400
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,700
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,500
"Hey, maybe the guy..."
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,500
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,200
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,200
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,500
You are shit...
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,400
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,600
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,800
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,900
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,300
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,300
I don't know what...
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,200
then you're... scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,300
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,700
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,700
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,500
I'm done with you.

1580
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,700
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,100
What?

1582
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,100
How do you know
I made it up?

1583
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,700
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,400
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:43,100
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,200
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,400
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,100
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,400
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,900
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,700
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,900
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,200
last night I didn't.

1594
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,700
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,200
How did you know that?

1596
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:34,000
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,500
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,500
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,200
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,700
Because this is my job!

1601
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,700
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,700
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,400
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,800
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,000
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,900
What did you do
with the leads?

1607
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,700
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,400
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,900
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1610
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,100
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,500
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,900
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,600
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,100
Now, where are the leads?

1616
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,200
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,900
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,500
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,300
Where are the leads?

1620
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,800
All right.

1621
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,700
I sold them.

1622
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,100
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,500
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,400
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,900
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,800
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,800
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,500
Moss.

1629
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,100
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,700
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,000
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,400
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,700
Mmm.

1634
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,900
Wait a minute.
Okay... hey, hey, John!

1635
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,200
Wait... okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,800
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,700
Eh, John?

1638
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,000
Last night...

1639
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,800
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1640
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,800
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,100
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:54,300
Hey... put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,900
What it taught me...
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,300
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,200
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:07,200
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,900
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,500
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,200
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,400
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,100
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,700
What?

1653
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,500
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,300
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,200
Where are you going?

1656
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:36,000
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,300
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,600
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,000
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,000
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,000
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take...

1662
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,500
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,900
Wait, John.

1664
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:02,400
John... okay.

1665
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,600
This is what
we're gonna do... 20%.

1666
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,900
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,900
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
50.

1669
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:22,500
- 50% of all my sales.
- What sales?

1670
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,800
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,000
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,500
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,500
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg...
do you want to see the memos?

1674
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,200
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week...

1675
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,800
when I was with Webb...
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,900
They're nuts.

1677
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,400
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,400
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,700
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,100
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,100
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1682
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,000
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,700
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,600
The people are insane.

1685
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,500
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,700
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:25,300
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
My daughter.

1689
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,300
Fuck you.

1690
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,900
Asshole.

1691
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,100
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,700
What a day.

1693
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,700
Whoo...

1694
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,300
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,500
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,600
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,800
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1698
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,700
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,300
bureaucrats...

1700
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,200
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,500
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,800
No adventure to it.

1703
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,200
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,600
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's... that's...

1705
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,400
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,900
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,200
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time...

1708
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,200
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"...

1709
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,700
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,500
There's..." you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,500
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,400
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today...

1713
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,600
that was so good.
That... it...

1714
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,500
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,100
That was admirable.

1716
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,900
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,500
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,300
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,600
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,200
Yeah.

1721
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,600
Want to swing around the Chinks'...
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,000
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,000
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,200
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,200
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,900
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,200
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,700
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,600
- Mr. Levene?
...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,500
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,900
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,400
so if you or your husband
are truly interested...

1733
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,000
because I can't hold
this parcel past...

1734
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,500
Yes?

1735
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,600
Well, what would be better
for you... say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,100
Go ask him. Shel... we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,100
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,300
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,300
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1740
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,400
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,800
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,100
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky...

1743
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,000
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is...

1744
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,100
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:52,100
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:58,400
8:00 P.M.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,200
Not at all...
thank you very much.

1748
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,100
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,300
No. I don't know.

1750
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,300
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,800
No.

1752
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,000
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,100
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:48,500
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,800
Yes... you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1756
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:56,800
# Blue skies smiling at me #

1757
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:02,100
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1758
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:05,200
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1759
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,200
# Singing a song #

1760
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,200
# Nothing but bluebirds #

1761
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,200
# From now on #

1762
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:17,400
# I never saw the sun
shining so bright #

1763
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,200
# Never saw things
going so right #

1764
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,200
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1765
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,700
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1766
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:31,200
# Blue days,
all of them gone #

1767
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:36,300
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on... #

1768
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,200
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1769
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:31,900
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1770
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,400
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1771
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,500
# Singing a song #

1772
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,400
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1773
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,900
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1774
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,500
# Shining so bright #

1775
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,400
# Never saw things
going so right #

1776
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,200
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1777
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,300
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1778
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:00,000
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1779
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:05,300
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1780
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,600
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1781
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,000
# Singing a song #

1782
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:15,900
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1783
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,300
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1784
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,100
# Shining so bright #

1785
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,700
# Never saw things
going so right #

1786
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,700
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1787
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,400
# When you're in love,
my how they fly #

1788
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,500
# Blue days #

1789
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,100
# All of them,
all of them gone #

1790
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,900
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1791
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,500
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1792
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:50,300
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1793
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,200
# Now on #

1794
01:39:53,200 --> 01:40:01,400
# Nothing but blue skies. #
