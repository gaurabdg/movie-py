1
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,970
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,170
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,110
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,540
'cause one night,

5
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,710
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,940
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,620
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,890
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,290
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,160
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,460
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve...

12
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,540
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,400
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,480
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,120
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,810
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,750
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,260
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,330
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,990
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,770
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,380
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,470
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,670
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,050
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,450
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,680
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,690
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,960
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,690
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,960
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,970
Just like home...
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,870
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,240
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,410
Help!

38
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,980
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,050
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,850
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,980
La Motta fighting
out of a halfcrouch.

42
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,090
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,160
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,820
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,440
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,440
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,440
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,170
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,180
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,720
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,050
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,660
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,790
Reeves is up again,
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,060
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,790
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,900
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,010
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,370
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,480
Two... three...

60
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,080
four... five...

61
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,680
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,810
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,420
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,590
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,590
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,090
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,530
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,500
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,760
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,300
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,040
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,710
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,680
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,810
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,060
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,530
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,570
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
You won... let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,300
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,710
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,750
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,920
Help!

84
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,330
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,930
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,970
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,300
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,340
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,670
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,240
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,240
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,970
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,410
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,420
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,350
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,420
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,420
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,420
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,620
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,530
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,530
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,290
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,360
They knew.

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,900
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,370
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,280
The people knew.

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,720
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,790
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,820
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,090
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,660
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,730
Is it done?

113
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,240
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,080
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,240
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,410
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,650
Bring it over!

120
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,850
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,360
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,130
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,730
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,800
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,460
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,440
That's... there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,140
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,210
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,150
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,050
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,650
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,680
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,990
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,460
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,060
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,890
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,300
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,400
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,510
Yeah?

142
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,400
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,410
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,350
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,150
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,950
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,920
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,580
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,990
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,690
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,700
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,830
What's the matter with you,

153
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,500
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,610
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,830
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,340
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,110
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,650
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,950
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,560
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,490
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,650
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,260
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,390
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,060
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,070
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,970
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,570
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,810
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,810
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,970
What'd I do?

172
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,150
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,650
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,260
You can't, I'm telling you...

175
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,120
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,490
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,860
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,730
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,810
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,530
What's wrong?

181
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,840
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,320
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,290
My hands.

184
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,960
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,460
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,700
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,340
Know what that means?

188
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,570
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,150
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,480
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,950
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,820
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,860
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,530
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,660
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,540
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,770
It's not normal.

199
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,610
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,520
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,090
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,090
Forget about it.

203
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,320
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,430
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,970
We have fights all the time...
are you worried now?

206
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,190
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,630
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,740
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,140
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,080
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,410
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,580
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,150
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,150
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,050
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,830
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,530
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,430
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,230
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,030
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,270
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,610
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,440
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,850
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,050
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,120
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,490
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,680
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,460
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,220
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,130
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,500
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,000
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,370
- That's enough with that...
- Take it off.

235
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,600
Come on.

236
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,830
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,530
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,270
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,470
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,380
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,140
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,780
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,940
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,280
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,850
How you doin'?

247
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,580
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,650
Joey.

249
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,650
Come here.

250
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,860
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160
Looks mad.

252
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,700
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,740
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,100
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,300
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,510
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,580
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,820
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,930
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,370
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,210
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,720
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,680
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,910
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,150
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,200
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,960
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,060
Is that what you're talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,260
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,270
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,430
What are ya,
a jerk there?

273
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,580
What the fuck

275
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,580
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,030
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,140
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,040
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,710
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,430
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,490
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,100
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,130
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,300
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,340
What's her last name?

287
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,930
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,310
She knows them?

289
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,380
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,150
Everybody knows each other...
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,380
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,860
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,720
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,920
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,090
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,930
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,730
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,070
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,610
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,210
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,840
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,780
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,510
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's...

304
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,590
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about... she's not like that.

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,280
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,620
You know, it's...

307
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,960
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,120
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,670
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,740
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,930
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,370
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,840
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,010
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,410
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,180
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,520
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,280
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,360
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,260
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,160
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,230
- That's...
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,030
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,140
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,530
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,040
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,440
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,550
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,600
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,310
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,850
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,790
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,260
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,620
Big shot.

335
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot...

336
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,360
without his gun.

337
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,300
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,140
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,810
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,820
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,320
Big shot.

342
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,990
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,230
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,560
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,670
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,830
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,570
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,640
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,510
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,740
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,350
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,440
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,780
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,120
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,660
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,120
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,350
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,760
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,460
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,970
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,870
You and your fuckin' ass...
you, too ya... go out!

363
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,600
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,070
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,080
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,840
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,450
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,650
Jack.

369
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,970
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,600
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,370
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,100
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,440
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,950
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,450
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,720
- Hello, Joe. How you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,830
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,260
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,630
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,140
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,570
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,440
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,980
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,710
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,540
D'you put money
in the basket this week?

386
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,330
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,730
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,040
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,110
Go ahead.

390
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,260
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,870
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,230
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,030
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,540
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,940
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,840
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,890
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,090
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,790
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,690
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,130
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,630
There.

403
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,410
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,640
Hi.

405
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,480
How you doin'?

406
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,150
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,930
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,100
Where you from?

410
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,740
Around here.

411
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,810
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,620
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,950
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,580
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,820
Okay.

416
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,300
Move over.

417
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,250
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,820
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,690
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,920
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,690
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,200
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,770
You see it?

424
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,810
No.

425
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,170
What does that mean?

426
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,170
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,470
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,810
Daddy?

429
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,580
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,560
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,470
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,280
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,170
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,120
Salute.

435
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,570
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,740
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,830
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,900
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,770
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,700
That's better.

441
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,310
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,820
Some water?

443
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,330
All right.

445
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,940
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,130
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,570
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,240
What else?

449
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,750
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,460
That's a bird.

451
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,030
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,770
The restroom.

453
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,490
Sit down.

454
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,140
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,540
I know.

456
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,340
You look good, though.

457
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,360
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,320
I don't know.

459
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,660
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,500
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,370
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,410
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,740
for their second fight.

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,810
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,470
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,150
You can see the contrast
in their styles...

467
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,420
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,550
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,460
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,820
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,030
both hands to the head.
A left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,860
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,740
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point, 10-rounder.

474
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,900
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,510
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,950
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose,

477
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,180
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,190
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,350
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,590
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,410
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,810
The undefeated Sugar Ray...
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,040
La Motta coming at him again,
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,080
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,060
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,060
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,840
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,770
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull,

489
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,400
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,210
his first loss as a professional
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,480
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,520
the impossible...
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,780
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,410
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,460
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,390
Come here.

497
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,000
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,300
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,810
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,800
Come here.

501
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,320
Come here.

502
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,360
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,800
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,780
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,770
Make it better.

506
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,330
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,630
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,220
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,290
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,520
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,760
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,100
What?

514
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,500
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,290
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,670
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,300
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,830
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,070
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,670
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,110
meet for the third time.

522
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,620
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,350
These two men...
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,790
dangerous... so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,830
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,260
They've each won one,

527
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,590
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,660
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,200
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points.

530
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,110
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,040
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,150
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,450
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,820
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,580
- Robinson trying to get up.
...six... seven...

536
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,920
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,030
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,800
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,230
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,030
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,410
Your attention, fans.

542
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,170
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,080
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,740
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,080
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,090
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,420
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,960
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,560
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,140
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'...

551
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,310
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,870
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,570
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,450
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,080
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,550
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,180
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,600
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,730
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,100
Forget about all that shit...
this was your shot.

561
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,830
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,170
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,610
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,990
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,250
You sure?

566
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,880
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,260
Yeah, child, I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,500
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,660
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,710
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,040
Look at that... 168 pounds.

572
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,340
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,610
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,810
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,820
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,780
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,720
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,880
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,360
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,460
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,720
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,360
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,370
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you...

584
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,060
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,230
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,870
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,240
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,650
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,150
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,780
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,150
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,590
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,360
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,330
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,330
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,800
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,600
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,430
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,270
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,140
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,370
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,570
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,710
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,880
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,950
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,320
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,690
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,320
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,120
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,460
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,620
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,030
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,660
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,970
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,440
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,740
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,440
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,310
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,970
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,580
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,320
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,320
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,660
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,320
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,400
- You beat him now...
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,430
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,940
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win...
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,540
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,840
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,740
- Nothin'...
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,870
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,480
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,520
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,850
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,260
Who asked you?

636
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,990
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,060
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,790
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,270
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,960
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,410
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,070
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,940
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,980
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,150
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds...

646
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,190
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,590
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,490
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,260
- your usual diet...
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,270
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,100
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,540
Like what?

653
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,610
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,780
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,940
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,020
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,920
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,960
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,390
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,150
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,130
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,730
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,060
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,500
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,230
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,900
and you tell her, "What are you?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,510
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,680
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,980
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't...

670
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,050
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,210
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,020
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,390
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,460
All right.

675
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,930
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,590
Make up with her.

677
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,790
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,670
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,170
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,270
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,670
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:37,740
All right?

683
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,870
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,540
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,950
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,210
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,320
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,580
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,520
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,260
Come here.

691
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,530
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,760
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,200
What a great audience.

694
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,270
Come on, lady, laugh it up...
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,200
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,210
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,010
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,610
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,820
What's your name again?

700
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,430
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,320
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,430
He hits me with a left hook...
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,970
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,780
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,540
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,810
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,420
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,210
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,820
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,420
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,650
See ya later.

712
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,400
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,050
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,830
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,160
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,400
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,700
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,360
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,030
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,800
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,740
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,010
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,590
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,630
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,230
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,430
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,830
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,810
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,000
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,840
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,750
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,720
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:41,560
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,890
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,830
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,400
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,470
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,670
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,610
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,840
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,680
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,790
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,790
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,860
Yeah.

745
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,850
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,330
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,560
What do you gotta? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,360
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,100
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,170
Shall I take the?

751
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,600
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,610
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,270
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,380
I tell ya the truth, it's so...
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,660
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,390
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,260
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,770
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,530
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,040
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,040
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,450
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,040
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,590
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,950
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,790
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,120
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,200
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes,

769
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,800
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,100
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,940
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,310
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,200
I think he should.

774
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,980
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,140
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,340
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,480
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,590
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,420
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,290
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,870
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,770
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,240
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,470
Yeah?

785
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,450
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,520
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,850
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,620
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,350
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:29,360
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,620
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,130
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,170
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,830
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,070
I don't know, I got a problem...
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,210
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,580
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,240
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,410
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,540
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,280
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,360
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,650
I'll get you both in the ring
and give yous both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,320
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,530
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,900
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,670
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,410
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,270
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,520
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:04,650
No.

812
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,060
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,430
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,770
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,370
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,040
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,210
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,620
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,590
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,790
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,130
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,300
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,150
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,510
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,280
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,420
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,820
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,420
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,730
Four pounds.

830
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,820
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,630
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it...

832
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,840
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,240
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,970
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,240
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,080
I don't know.
You never know these things...

837
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,920
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,950
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,390
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,390
Pleasure... heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,830
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,800
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,590
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,930
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,730
What ever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,470
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,080
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,470
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,270
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,680
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,940
He's workin' downtown,
big building... workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,380
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,920
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,750
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,880
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,550
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,590
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,720
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,350
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,490
Come on back. Okay.

861
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,270
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,740
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,070
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,770
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,650
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of you are the same.

867
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,750
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,850
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,490
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,990
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,820
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,020
and havin' both of you
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,900
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,500
- Don't make me...
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,630
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,860
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,170
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,040
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,800
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,880
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,610
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,840
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,620
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,090
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,720
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,630
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,800
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,900
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,970
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,300
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,100
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,800
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,810
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:32,040
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,580
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,050
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,250
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,950
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,060
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,460
We're friends,
we can straighten this...

901
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,230
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,460
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:58,200
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,470
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,480
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,180
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,050
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,550
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,890
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:18,290
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,330
Hey, you fuckin'...
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,460
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,630
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,570
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,700
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,240
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,050
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,750
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,250
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,870
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,010
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,710
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,420
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,850
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

925
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,690
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

926
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,960
and we're gonna forget about it.

927
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,530
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,290
Right?

929
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,460
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

930
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,660
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

931
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,300
and no grudges.

932
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,210
That's the most important thing...
no grudges.

933
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,980
Now, come on, shake hands.

934
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,190
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

935
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,380
All right?

936
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,420
I only wish this thing
never happened.

937
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,360
We all wish it never happened.

938
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,590
Right?
You'll get over it.

939
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,830
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

940
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,060
Yeah, all right.

941
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,540
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

942
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,660
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

943
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,010
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

944
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,780
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

945
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,650
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

946
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,450
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

947
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,090
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

948
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,460
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

949
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,630
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

950
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,900
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

951
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,370
No, it's nothin' like that.

952
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:47,380
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

953
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,450
all the fights and all.

954
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,620
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

955
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,150
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

956
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:00,980
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

957
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,360
and I'm lookin' very bad.

958
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:07,330
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

959
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,920
What is it with him?

960
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:12,000
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

961
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,730
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

962
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,840
The man's got a head of rock.

963
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,280
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

964
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,280
Jack respects you.

965
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,890
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

966
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,250
You he talks to, he likes you.

967
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,350
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

968
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,470
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

969
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,930
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

970
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,470
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

971
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,600
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

972
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,000
Make it on his own.

973
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:56,170
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

974
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,750
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

975
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,250
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

976
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,650
That's not crazy.

977
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:08,160
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

978
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,390
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

979
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:15,690
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

980
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,430
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

981
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,560
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

982
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,230
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

983
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,170
Now, you're a smart kid.

984
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,670
You go to him, you tell him...

985
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,110
Son of a bitch.

986
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,780
Twenty dollar shoe here.

987
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,960
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

988
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,300
What's the matter?

989
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,630
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

990
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,800
- Who?
- Vickie.

991
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,820
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

992
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:13,090
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

993
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,320
Just once.

994
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,900
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

995
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,660
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

996
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,760
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

997
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,670
'cause that's what's happenin'.

998
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,440
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

999
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,880
So, what'd that guy say?

1000
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,450
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1001
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,050
The good news is

1002
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,290
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1003
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:57,630
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1004
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,740
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1005
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,270
You didn't know that was comin'?

1006
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,000
You win some,
you lose some.

1007
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,610
This one, we're losin'.

1008
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,040
Billy Fox.

1009
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,380
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1010
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:21,250
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1011
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,620
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1012
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,460
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1013
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,930
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1014
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,040
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1015
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,940
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1016
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,100
and It's not good.

1017
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,180
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1018
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:41,110
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1019
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:45,050
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1020
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,340
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1021
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,620
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1022
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,280
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1023
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,190
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1024
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,620
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1025
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,520
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1026
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,130
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1027
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,700
Okay, that's it.

1028
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,130
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1029
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,930
- That was it?
- That was it.

1030
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:16,970
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1031
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,980
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1032
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,180
feature attraction.

1033
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,850
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1034
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,750
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1035
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,660
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1036
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,530
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1037
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,640
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1038
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,940
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1039
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,010
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1040
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:51,550
It's all right, yeah.

1041
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,310
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1042
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,210
Five seconds, Alex.

1043
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,530
Come on, stand...
come on, stand up!

1044
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:13,330
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1045
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,130
Come on.

1046
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,170
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1047
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,820
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1048
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,410
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1049
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,820
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1050
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,480
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1051
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,760
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1052
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,430
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1053
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,760
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1054
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,530
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1055
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,940
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1056
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,810
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1057
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,440
Pocket your dirty money!

1058
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:02,610
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1059
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,280
We're stoppin' the fight!

1060
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,150
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1061
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,780
And you standin' there.

1062
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,900
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1063
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:17,700
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1064
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,200
The winner
by technical knockout,

1065
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,470
and still undefeated,

1066
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,580
Billy Fox!

1067
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,850
What'd I do?!

1068
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,080
Don't fight anymore.

1069
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,990
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,160
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1071
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,700
What'd I do?

1072
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,680
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview...

1073
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,690
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1074
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,230
Why did I do it? Why?

1075
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,100
They got some balls,
some balls.

1076
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,460
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1077
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,560
They want me
to go down, too?

1078
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:32,180
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1079
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,870
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1080
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,280
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1081
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:42,320
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1082
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,980
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1083
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,990
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1084
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,720
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1085
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,920
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1086
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,730
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1087
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,060
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1088
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,390
I don't know.

1089
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,530
"Purse was withheld..." look at this...
"Purse was withheld pending

1090
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,700
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1091
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,400
Look how they make me look.

1092
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,540
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1093
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,180
A what?

1094
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,550
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1095
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,280
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1096
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,680
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1097
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,890
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1098
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,550
What are you talkin' about?

1099
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,560
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1100
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,890
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1101
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,060
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1102
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,070
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1103
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,930
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1104
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,970
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1105
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,970
- is if he dies, he won't be able to...
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1106
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,250
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1107
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,150
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1108
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:52,850
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1109
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,030
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1110
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,150
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1111
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,920
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1112
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,590
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1113
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,000
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1114
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,270
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1115
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:11,930
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1116
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,340
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1117
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,450
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1118
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,180
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1119
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,180
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1120
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,410
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1121
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:26,080
I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,160
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1123
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,830
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1124
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,800
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1125
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:37,930
You're worried about that?

1126
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,470
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1127
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,470
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1128
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,010
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1129
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,580
Order me a piece of cake.

1130
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,580
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1131
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,310
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1132
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,420
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1133
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,020
That's good,
order me one of those.

1134
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,020
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1135
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,350
Since when did you
order one of those?

1136
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,860
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1137
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,090
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1138
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,330
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1139
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,370
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1140
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,600
I'm not tellin' her... personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1141
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,330
What were you tellin' her that for?

1142
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,340
Order me a cheeseburger.

1143
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:25,910
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1144
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,350
What the f?

1145
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,550
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1146
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:32,620
Forty seconds.

1147
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,280
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1148
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,520
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1149
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,130
Ya up?

1150
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,170
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1151
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,640
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1152
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:50,040
How are you?

1153
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,480
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1154
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,210
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1155
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,050
Thank you.

1156
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,120
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1157
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:09,320
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1158
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,930
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:15,090
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1160
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:16,700
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1161
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,130
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1162
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:19,200
No, thank you, Tommy.

1163
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,360
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1164
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,170
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1165
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,570
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1166
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,640
See you later, everybody.

1167
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,610
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1168
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,220
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1169
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,440
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1170
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,420
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1171
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,820
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1172
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,760
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1173
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,120
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1174
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,960
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1175
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,070
Good-bye, honey.

1176
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:52,700
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1177
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,460
Can you believe that girl?

1178
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,900
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1179
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,200
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1180
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,780
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1181
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,150
Hey! Come here.

1182
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,220
Come here a minute.

1183
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,260
What was all that about?

1184
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,990
All what?

1185
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,870
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1186
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,610
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1187
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,800
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1188
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,610
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1189
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,080
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1190
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,690
- I hear.
- Hey!

1191
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,880
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1192
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,610
You hear what I said?

1193
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,990
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1194
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,860
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1195
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,590
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1196
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:58,130
Shut up! I'll fuckin'
take care of you later!

1197
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:59,360
Shut up!

1198
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:10,280
Disgusted with the two of you.

1199
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,180
Get to you later.

1200
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,830
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1201
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,130
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1202
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,460
All right, let's go.

1203
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,990
Good luck, Jake!

1204
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:48,410
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

1205
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,070
In this corner,
the very worthy challenger,

1206
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,620
weighing in at 1581/4 pounds,

1207
01:19:55,750 --> 01:20:00,020
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1208
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,500
Shake hands,
come out fighting at the bell.

1209
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,720
Kill him!

1210
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,150
Pressure, pressure, pressure!

1211
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,310
Now finish him off.
He's all stupiada, you got him.

1212
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,970
Come on, Jake!

1213
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,120
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall
right over for ya.

1214
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:02,880
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1215
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,520
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1216
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,990
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1217
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:12,600
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1218
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1219
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:32,380
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1220
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,710
And the winner by
a technical knockout

1221
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,220
in the tenth round,

1222
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,080
and the new
Middleweight Champion of the World,

1223
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,950
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1224
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,530
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1225
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,150
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1226
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,950
It's the worst thing you could do.

1227
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,660
Oh, you're home.

1228
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:22,100
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1229
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,270
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1230
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,270
I went out.
What's the matter?

1231
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,870
Television won't work.

1232
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,210
Where'd you go?

1233
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:38,610
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1234
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:53,520
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1235
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:55,690
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1236
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:57,320
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1237
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:58,400
Come on, huh?

1238
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,060
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1239
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,760
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1240
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,810
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1241
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,530
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1242
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,780
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1243
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:19,910
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1244
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,130
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1245
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,760
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1246
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,660
That's it, go ahead...
forget how long it took you

1247
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,860
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1248
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,700
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1249
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,100
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1250
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,270
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1251
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,390
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1252
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,310
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1253
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,650
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1254
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,690
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1255
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,830
- Didn't I?
- No.

1256
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:00,290
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1257
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,730
It was no big thing, anyway.

1258
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,630
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1259
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,930
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1260
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:09,040
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1261
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,230
How come you
never told me about it?

1262
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,570
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1263
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:17,040
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1264
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,880
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with... Vickie?

1265
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,420
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1266
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,520
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1267
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:30,020
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1268
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:34,920
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1269
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,530
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1270
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,600
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1271
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,260
I heard some things.

1272
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:43,570
- You heard about me and Salvy...
- I heard things, Joey.

1273
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:46,200
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1274
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,210
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1275
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,400
I heard some things.

1276
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:52,010
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1277
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,550
You know what
you should worry about?

1278
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,710
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1279
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,750
Do that.

1280
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,650
Christ!

1281
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,930
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1282
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,630
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1283
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,010
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1284
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,080
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1285
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,240
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1286
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,780
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1287
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,180
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1288
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,910
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1289
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:30,950
- He thinks he's a wiseguy...
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1290
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,080
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1291
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,750
Hey, I'm your brother.

1292
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,920
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1293
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,530
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1294
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,560
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1295
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,760
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1296
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,300
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1297
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,170
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1298
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,980
You give me
that look, Joey.

1299
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,650
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1300
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:07,720
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1301
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,490
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1302
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:14,860
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1303
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,400
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1304
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:18,800
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1305
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,770
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1306
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,700
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1307
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,710
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1308
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,710
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1309
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,910
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1310
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,040
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1311
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,090
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1312
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,420
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1313
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,350
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1314
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,890
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1315
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:47,520
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1316
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,030
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you...

1317
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,570
you included you with them.

1318
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,110
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1319
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,640
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1320
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,610
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1321
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,240
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1322
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,320
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,750
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1324
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:13,750
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1325
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,830
You ask me that?

1326
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,490
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1327
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,560
Just tell me.

1328
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:31,270
I'm not answerin' that.

1329
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,540
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1330
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,340
You're very smart, Joey.

1331
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,920
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1332
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,380
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1333
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,890
Did you or did you not?

1334
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,500
I'm not gonna answer.

1335
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,530
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1336
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,690
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1337
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,100
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1338
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,180
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1339
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,400
You're a sick bastard...
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1340
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,570
You know what you should do?

1341
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,270
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1342
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,540
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1343
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,780
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1344
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,980
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1345
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,790
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1346
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:08,930
Where were ya?

1347
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,400
I was at my sister's.

1348
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,170
Where'd you go after that?

1349
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:16,240
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1350
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,910
Father of the Bride.

1351
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,320
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1352
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,330
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1353
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:36,020
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1354
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,390
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1355
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,470
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1356
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:45,840
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1357
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,380
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1358
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,770
- Huh?
- No!

1359
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,710
Open the door.

1360
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,450
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1361
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:01,960
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1362
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:04,620
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1363
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,020
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1364
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,260
No.

1365
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,830
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1366
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,600
I didn't do anything!

1367
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,780
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1368
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:20,880
I fucked all of 'em!

1369
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:23,100
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1370
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,770
I fucked all of 'em... Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1371
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,540
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1372
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,450
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1373
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,390
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1374
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,550
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1375
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,660
Forget fuckin' with you!

1376
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,430
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1377
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,500
Where you goin'?

1378
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,170
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1379
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:55,140
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1380
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:59,150
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1381
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,750
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1382
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,750
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1383
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:06,480
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1384
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,620
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1385
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,660
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like...

1386
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,990
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1387
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:17,530
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1388
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:22,670
Get off of him!

1389
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:29,040
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1390
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,210
Call the police!

1391
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,290
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1392
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:40,580
Get out!

1393
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,650
Don't leave, honey, please.

1394
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,880
Honey, look... I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1395
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,090
Just...

1396
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:55,820
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1397
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,150
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1398
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,160
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life,

1399
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,170
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1400
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,170
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1401
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,900
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1402
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,040
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1403
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:17,540
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1404
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,150
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1405
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,910
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1406
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:25,780
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1407
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,190
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1408
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,560
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1409
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:37,430
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1410
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,770
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1411
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,930
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1412
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:45,740
Six... seven...

1413
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,330
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1414
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,470
You're out!

1415
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,910
It is all over!

1416
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:54,140
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1417
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,950
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1418
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:59,560
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1419
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:02,280
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1420
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:08,620
Come on.

1421
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,630
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1422
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:19,800
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1423
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,680
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1424
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,650
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1425
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,090
Go ahead.

1426
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,450
Hey, champ... like to ask
you a few questions.

1427
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,950
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1428
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,680
- Excuse me, my wife is...
- There's a great angle here...

1429
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,450
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1430
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:09,790
Come on. All right, champ?

1431
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,620
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya?

1432
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,730
Hello?

1433
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:34,250
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1434
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,410
Is that you?

1435
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:38,420
I know somebody's there,
I can hear you breathin'.

1436
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,250
You listenin'?

1437
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:45,160
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1438
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,760
You got that?

1439
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,900
The fight of the year.

1440
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:40,280
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1441
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:43,350
Give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1442
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,690
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1443
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,020
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1444
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:57,960
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1445
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:02,000
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1446
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,230
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1447
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:09,340
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1448
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,040
There's the buzzer,

1449
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,150
and I think you know
both the boys.

1450
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,320
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1451
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:32,330
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1452
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,700
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1453
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,640
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1454
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,470
Come on! Come on.

1455
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:49,410
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1456
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:52,420
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1457
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,180
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1458
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,960
These are clean, whistling shots.

1459
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:05,750
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1460
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,090
No man can endure this pummeling!

1461
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:10,960
The fight is stopped on...

1462
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,800
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1463
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:16,870
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1464
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,500
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1465
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,630
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1466
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,770
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1467
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:27,970
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1468
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,210
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1469
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:33,340
Never went down, Ray.

1470
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,460
You never got me down, Ray.

1471
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,450
Ya hear me?

1472
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,150
Never got me down.

1473
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,700
Yeah? See, look?

1474
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,500
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1475
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,470
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1476
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,360
And there you see it...

1477
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:54,680
a champion gone down to defeat.

1478
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,780
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1479
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:01,820
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1480
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,950
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1481
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:06,490
throughout the world,

1482
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:09,150
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1483
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:12,860
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1484
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,930
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1485
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,360
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner...

1486
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,440
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1487
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:24,370
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1488
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:26,370
of the thirteenth round,

1489
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,380
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1490
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:30,880
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1491
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,420
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1492
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,290
It's over for me...
boxing's over for me.

1493
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:45,150
I'm through.

1494
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:48,120
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1495
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:51,290
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1496
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,830
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1497
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:56,340
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1498
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,840
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1499
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,800
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1500
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:07,020
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1501
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,310
Take a picture, Bob.

1502
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,080
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey... for us.

1503
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,810
Go ahead, smile.

1504
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:16,250
Thank you, Bob.

1505
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:19,160
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1506
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,730
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1507
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:30,800
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1508
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:32,130
I think it's great.

1509
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,570
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1510
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:36,470
He's home with us
all the time now.

1511
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,710
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1512
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,370
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1513
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,640
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1514
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:46,980
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1515
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,060
I don't know.

1516
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,950
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1517
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:04,470
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1518
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,510
Thank you.

1519
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,880
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1520
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,350
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1521
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:27,090
See how that sounds.

1522
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:29,660
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,890
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1524
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,500
at Madison Square Garden.

1525
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:37,640
Okay, honey.

1526
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,310
Thank you, doll.

1527
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:43,270
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1528
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:45,010
- Salute.
- Salute.

1529
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,350
Look at this terrific girl.

1530
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:51,780
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1531
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,190
especially if he's a degenerate.

1532
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:56,620
Did I say that?

1533
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,020
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1534
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,860
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1535
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,270
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1536
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:12,860
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1537
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:14,170
you're all full of shit.

1538
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:20,050
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1539
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,380
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1540
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:27,050
Is she here?
She's not here.

1541
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,990
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1542
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:31,750
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate...

1543
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:34,360
it's a little different...
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1544
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,660
Thank you.

1545
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,000
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1546
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,000
One was married,
one was single.

1547
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,500
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1548
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,340
"What's the matter with you?

1549
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:48,600
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1550
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,510
And look at me,
and look at you."

1551
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,980
Let me get on with it.

1552
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,640
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1553
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:00,190
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1554
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,420
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1555
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,530
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1556
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,530
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1557
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:08,360
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1558
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,020
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1559
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:13,660
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1560
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,270
What time does
your wife get home?"

1561
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,570
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1562
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:25,240
he would say

1563
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,480
that the thing ain't the ring,

1564
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,480
it's the play.

1565
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,080
So give me a stage

1566
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:35,490
where this bull here can rage,

1567
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,490
and though I can fight,

1568
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:39,990
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1569
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,600
That's entertainment!

1570
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,420
Jake, how have you been?

1571
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:18,560
Hey!
You were just great.

1572
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:21,230
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1573
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:24,340
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1574
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:26,940
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1575
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:30,010
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1576
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:32,240
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1577
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,780
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1578
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,280
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1579
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:40,890
It's good seein' you.

1580
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,250
That is a joke, right?

1581
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:44,590
It's a joke...
only you know if it's a joke.

1582
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,320
He's just kidding, right?

1583
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,300
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1584
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,160
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1585
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,060
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1586
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,030
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1587
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:57,440
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1588
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:01,240
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1589
01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:06,100
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1590
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:09,780
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1591
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:13,380
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1592
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,780
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1593
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,450
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1594
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:19,580
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1595
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:21,920
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1596
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,330
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1597
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:25,990
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1598
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:28,070
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1599
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:29,730
What's the problem?

1600
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:30,860
There's really not a problem.

1601
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:33,840
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1602
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:36,000
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1603
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,410
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1604
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,780
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1605
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,850
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1606
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:50,860
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1607
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:52,260
What about you?
How old are you?

1608
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,760
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1609
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,830
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1610
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,230
Come here.

1611
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,440
She's 21, too?

1612
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,450
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1613
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,930
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1614
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:36,540
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1615
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:51,650
There.

1616
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:58,250
Come on, Jake.

1617
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:06,570
Lonely nights

1618
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:10,570
I'm so lonely

1619
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:13,400
Please come home

1620
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:17,810
You great big
lump of sugar

1621
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,510
I miss you so much

1622
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:22,450
Please come home

1623
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,520
Lonely nights

1624
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,670
It was a busy night last night.

1625
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:46,470
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1626
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,010
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1627
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:52,410
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1628
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:56,210
- Move over.
- Why?

1629
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:58,820
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1630
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:00,420
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1631
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,010
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1632
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,060
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1633
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:07,190
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1634
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,290
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1635
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:12,030
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1636
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:13,430
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1637
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:15,970
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1638
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,230
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1639
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:45,420
Wake up, champ.

1640
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,030
What's up?

1641
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:54,740
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1642
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,140
- They wanna talk with you.
- You all look the same to me.

1643
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,650
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1644
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,720
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1645
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:04,220
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do you want?

1646
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:05,450
For what?

1647
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:11,220
Do you recognize this girl?

1648
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:14,290
She been in the club?

1649
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:20,100
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1650
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:23,500
Nah, I don't know her.

1651
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,770
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1652
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:29,470
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1653
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:33,880
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1654
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:36,040
But I don't say nothin'.

1655
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:39,050
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1656
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:41,990
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1657
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,060
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1658
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,320
Let me ask you somethin'.

1659
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:56,560
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1660
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,800
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1661
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:02,040
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1662
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:04,510
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1663
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:07,150
For what,
because of this girl?

1664
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,810
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1665
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,750
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1666
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,550
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1667
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:18,280
Let me just get somethin'.

1668
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:21,030
All right, don't make no noise.

1669
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,130
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,360
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1671
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,300
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1672
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,300
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1673
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,640
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1674
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,040
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1675
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:37,440
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1676
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,980
You saw the papers...
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1677
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,420
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1678
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,250
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1679
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:49,860
Yeah, what friends?

1680
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,120
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1681
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,590
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1682
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,010
What's the matter with you?

1683
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:06,610
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1684
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,800
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1685
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:11,740
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1686
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,820
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1687
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:18,010
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1688
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:21,020
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1689
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,490
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together...

1690
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,020
Give me 2,000 for them.

1691
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,420
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all...

1692
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,430
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1693
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:32,430
- I'm sorry. I'd lose...
- Give me them.

1694
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,940
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1695
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:38,900
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1696
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,440
I can't raise the 10,000.

1697
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:47,120
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1698
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,320
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1699
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:53,290
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1700
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:57,590
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1701
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:02,460
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1702
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,160
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1703
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,560
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1704
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,970
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1705
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:17,410
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1706
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,640
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1707
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:22,750
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1708
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:25,580
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1709
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,190
See it? See it?!

1710
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:30,320
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1711
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:32,990
Go on, boy, live in it!

1712
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:35,890
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1713
01:54:36,030 --> 01:54:37,120
Your mother's!

1714
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,030
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1715
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:45,440
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1716
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,040
Fuck you!

1717
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,100
Fuck your mother!

1718
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:31,240
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1719
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:40,090
Why? Why? Why?

1720
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:01,050
You motherfucker!

1721
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,450
My hands!

1722
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,560
Why'd you do it, why?

1723
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:22,070
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

1724
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,570
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1725
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:27,070
You're so stupid.

1726
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:30,010
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1727
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:31,510
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:36,020
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1729
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:40,820
I'm not that guy.

1730
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:02,780
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1731
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:05,810
"Look who's here... big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1732
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,450
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1733
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,390
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1734
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,460
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

1735
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:19,060
He said, "You're in it."

1736
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,160
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1737
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:24,270
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1738
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,370
Up yours.

1739
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:29,160
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1740
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,900
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1741
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,400
And the horse you rode in on.

1742
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:38,400
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1743
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:40,410
Funny man.

1744
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:42,740
That's why I'm here.

1745
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:46,750
Give him another drink.

1746
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:48,790
Piss in it for me.

1747
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:53,860
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1748
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,930
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

1749
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:59,530
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1750
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:01,800
I know you're all capable of it.

1751
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:03,870
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1752
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:08,110
Her name is Emma 48's.

1753
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:13,110
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1754
01:58:28,030 --> 01:58:29,190
Taxi!

1755
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,200
Honey...

1756
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:45,370
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1757
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:48,010
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1758
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:49,810
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1759
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:53,150
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1760
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:56,150
Be careful.

1761
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:12,100
Hey, what are you doin'?

1762
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,470
Joey.

1763
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:19,240
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1764
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:33,320
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

1765
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,190
Hey, Joey, come on.

1766
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,470
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1767
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:53,670
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

1768
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,580
Come on, be friends.

1769
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:57,210
Come on, you're my brother.

1770
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:58,820
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1771
01:59:58,950 --> 02:00:01,550
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1772
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:02,750
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1773
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,360
Give me a kiss, come on.

1774
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:07,760
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1775
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,330
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1776
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:12,930
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1777
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,830
Come on.

1778
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,600
You're my brother.
Come on.

1779
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:26,110
Come on, give me a kiss.

1780
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,610
- What?
- Come on.

1781
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:34,050
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1782
02:00:34,190 --> 02:00:36,120
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1783
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:38,960
- Family?
- All right.

1784
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,220
Come on.

1785
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:46,300
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

1786
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:49,840
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1787
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:51,870
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1788
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,010
Don't forget.

1789
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:57,470
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1790
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,220
...won it legitimately...

1791
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:15,350
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1792
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,520
Some people aren't that lucky.

1793
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:23,500
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront,

1794
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:26,270
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1795
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:28,270
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1796
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:30,970
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1797
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,880
And it went somethin' like this.

1798
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:38,950
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1799
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:42,210
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1800
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,890
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1801
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:49,720
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1802
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:51,130
"My night.

1803
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:54,170
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

1804
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,630
"So, what happens?

1805
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:59,140
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

1806
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:01,400
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1807
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:04,740
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1808
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:08,680
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1809
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:12,140
"It was you, Charley.

1810
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:14,480
"You was my brother.

1811
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:17,520
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

1812
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:20,760
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1813
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:23,920
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

1814
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:27,830
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

1815
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,170
"You don't understand.

1816
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:34,430
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1817
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:39,380
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

1818
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:43,110
"Let's face it...
it was you, Charley.

1819
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:46,950
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1820
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,460
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1821
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:51,950
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1822
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,230
- You need anything?
- No.

1823
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,450
You sure?

1824
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:57,620
I'm sure.

1825
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:05,130
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1826
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:27,420
Go get 'em, champ.

1827
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:39,440
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
