1
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:08,404
Never did eat your lunch, did ya?

2
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,575
I'd better
get back to the office.

3
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:15,662
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:18,665
Why don't you call your boss and
tell him to take the afternoon off.

5
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:21,169
It's Friday, anyway.
Huh?

6
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:24,172
Yeah? What do I do
with my free afternoon?

7
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,174
Walk you to the airport and...

8
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:29,678
Laze around here a while longer.

9
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,680
Checking out time is 3:00 p. M.

10
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,185
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in when you come in...

11
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,687
...but when your time's up...

12
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:46,652
I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:48,655
I have to go.

14
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,287
I can come down next week.

15
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,623
No.

16
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,919
Not even just to see you,
have lunch? In public.

17
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,339
Oh, we can see each other.
We can have dinner.

18
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,341
But respectably.

19
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:11,347
In my house, with my mother's picture
on the mantel...

20
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,350
...my sister helping me
to broil a steak for three.

21
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,560
I'd kinda like to
meet your sister.

22
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:18,563
She, um...

23
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,565
She look anything like you?

24
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,567
- Sam.
- No?

25
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:26,071
All right.

26
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:29,075
Marion, whenever possible
I want to see you...

27
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:31,077
...and under any conditions...

28
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,078
...even, uh, respectability.

29
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,372
You make respectability
sound so disrespectful.

30
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,375
No, I'm all for it.

31
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:43,213
Look, a couple years, I'll have
my father's debts paid off at the store.

32
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:46,717
And I told you, alimony stops as soon
as she gets married again.

33
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,138
Ohh. I haven't even been
married once yet.

34
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,766
Yeah, but when you do,
you'll swing.

35
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,062
So, let's get married.

36
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:01,483
You really wanna live in a hardware store
in Fairvale, eat beans out of a can with me?

37
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,195
- Oh?
- Yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.

38
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,199
Tell you what...
When I send my ex-wife her money...

39
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,870
...you can lick the stamps.

40
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,247
I'll lick the stamps.

41
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,543
Marion, you wanna cut this off...

42
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,172
...go out and find yourself someone
who's, uh, available?

43
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,174
I'm thinkin' of it.

44
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,596
Don't you go break my heart, now.

45
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,349
Don't miss your plane.

46
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,435
Hey, wait.
We can leave together, can't we?

47
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:37,272
I'm late, and you have
to put your shoes on.

48
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,573
Is Mr. Lowery
back from lunch yet?

49
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,575
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris St. Property.

50
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,578
- You know, the oil lease man?
- Right, right, right.

51
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,081
So, that's why he's late.

52
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,084
You getting a headache?

53
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,086
Lt'll pass.

54
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,090
Headaches are like resolutions: You forget
about 'em as soon as they stop hurting.

55
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,385
You got aspirins?

56
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:08,222
I have something.
Not aspirins, but...

57
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:11,725
My mother's doctor gave these to me
on the day of my wedding.

58
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,854
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

59
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,856
Any calls?

60
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,860
Oh, Teddy called me, and my mother
called to see if Teddy called.

61
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:24,198
And, oh, your sister called to say she'd
be going to Tucson to do some buying...

62
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:26,784
...and she'd be gone
the whole weekend, and...

63
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,785
Whoo!

64
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:30,787
Hot as fresh milk.

65
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,791
You girls oughta get your boss
to turn on the air-conditioning.

66
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,669
He can afford it today.

67
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,964
Marion, will you get those copies
of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

68
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,675
- Of course.
- Tomorrow's the day.

69
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,179
What a sweet little girl.

70
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,975
- Not you, darlin'. My daughter.
- Oh.

71
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:55,480
She's my baby, but tomorrow she stands
up there and gets married away from me.

72
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,483
Here, I'd like you
to have a look at my baby.

73
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,528
Eighteen years old...

74
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:06,242
...and never known an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

75
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:09,704
Come on, Tom.
The air conditioner's on in my office.

76
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:12,041
You know what I do
with unhappiness?

77
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,043
I buy it off.

78
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,422
- You unhappy?
- Oh, not inordinately, no.

79
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,424
Oh.

80
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,763
I'm buyin' this house
as a wedding present for my baby.

81
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:26,764
Now, that's not buyin' happiness.

82
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:28,766
That's buyin' off unhappiness, see?

83
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,644
Yes, sir.

84
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:35,357
Four hundred thousand dollars, cash.

85
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,025
Not to worry, now.

86
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:40,570
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose. Count 'em up.

87
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,407
- I declare!
- I don't.

88
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,534
That's how I'm able to keep it.

89
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:50,374
Tom, uh, cash transactions of this size,
uh... Most irregular.

90
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:53,627
Yeah, well, so what?
It's my private money. Now it's yours.

91
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,088
Suppose we just
put this in the safe...

92
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,092
...and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

93
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:04,221
Speaking of feeling good, what happened to
that bottle you said you had in your desk?

94
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,516
Mmm.

95
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:14,232
You know, sometimes I can
keep my mouth shut.

96
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:20,406
Lowery, I'm dyin'
of thirst-a-roonie here.

97
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:24,742
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

98
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,954
Put it the safe deposit box
at the bank.

99
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:31,250
- We'll get him to give us a check on Monday instead.
- Okay.

100
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:38,633
Oh! Ahh.

101
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:43,138
He was flirting with you.

102
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,308
Guess he must have noticed
my wedding ring.

103
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,356
Uh-huh.

104
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,358
Lowery.

105
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,781
Come in.

106
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:04,952
- The copies.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,956
If you don't mind, I'd like to go
right on home after the bank.

108
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,959
- I-I'm feeling a slight headache.
- You go ahead on home.

109
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:14,880
Me and your boss are gonna go out and
get ourselves a little drinkin' done.

110
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,882
Of course.
Do you feel ill?

111
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,385
Oh, it's just...
just a little headache.

112
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:23,138
You need a weekend in Las Vegas.
Playground of the world.

113
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,308
I'm gonna spend the weekend in bed.
Thank you.

114
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,478
Only playground
to beat Las Vegas.

115
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,016
Mmm.

116
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,543
Marion, what...
what are you doin' up here?

117
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,545
Where in the world did you get
all that money?

118
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:14,967
Yeah. It's more than I need
to get out of debt.

119
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:20,930
So I said, "Sandy...

120
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:25,353
...you see anything there you haven't
at least had a fifth of before?"

121
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,313
Sandy looks all up and down...

122
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,779
Sandy looks all up and down the bar,
and he says, "No. "

123
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:24,541
5-27, you comin' in 10-1?

124
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:27,252
5-31, try again in your new location.

125
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,972
21-13, are you available
for check five duty?

126
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,475
Hold it right there.

127
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,153
- In quite a hurry.
- Yes.

128
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:53,156
I- I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

129
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,492
I almost had an accident last night
from, from, uh, sleepiness...

130
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,995
...so I decided to pull over.

131
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,540
- You slept here all night?
- Yes.

132
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:04,543
As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open, so...

133
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:07,963
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

134
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,592
I mean, just to be safe.

135
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:14,094
- I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:17,638
- Then I'm free to go?
- Is anything wrong?

137
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,641
There's nothing wrong...

138
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,644
...except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

139
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,646
Now, just a moment.

140
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,399
Turn your motor off, please.

141
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,366
May I see your license
and registration?

142
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,285
- Why?
- Please.

143
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,073
Have a nice day.

144
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,586
Hey, Larry!
How soon do you want this?

145
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,341
Pick up line one.

146
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,552
It's about time.

147
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,554
O.B.'s working on that.

148
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,893
Be with you in a second!

149
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:21,044
5-28, was that Victor-Charlie-Bravo?

150
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,801
5-28, 10-4.
Victor-Charlie-Bravo.

151
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,476
I'm in no mood for trouble.

152
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,478
What?

153
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:40,481
There's an old saying
that the first customer of the day...

154
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,484
...is always the most trouble.

155
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:45,487
But I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna
treat you so fair and square...

156
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:47,990
...you're not gonna have
one human reason...

157
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,492
Can I trade in my car
and take another?

158
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:53,997
You can do anything you have a mind to.
Bein' a woman, you will.

159
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,999
- Is that yours?
- Yes. Yes.

160
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:59,669
- There's nothing wrong with it. I'm just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

161
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:03,924
Well, have a look around, see if there's
anything that strikes your eye.

162
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,093
Meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

163
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:09,763
I was just about to make some coffee.
You want some...

164
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,641
No, I'm in a hurry. I just wanna make
the change and start...

165
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:17,146
A person ought not to be in a hurry,
but it's too nice a day to argue.

166
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:20,149
So, I'll just shoot your car
in the garage.

167
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,152
O.B.!

168
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,238
Yeah, boss?

169
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:30,995
- What's up? - Can you take
this one, give it the once-over?

170
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:33,998
Sure. No problem.
I'll give it the standard.

171
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,294
Say, that's the one
I'd have picked for you myself.

172
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,798
- How much?
- Go ahead. Spin it around.

173
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,050
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it looks fine.

174
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,928
How much will it be
with my car?

175
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:50,432
- You don't want the usual
day-and-a-half to think it over? - No.

176
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:54,186
- You are in a hurry. Somebody chasin' ya?
- Well, of course not.

177
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:56,188
Please.

178
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,319
Well, that's the first time I ever saw
the customer high-pressure the salesman.

179
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,446
But I figure, uh, roughly...

180
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,324
...your car plus...

181
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:09,202
...four thousand?

182
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:11,830
Four thousand.
Four thousand.

183
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:15,458
Ah, you got time
to argue price, though, huh?

184
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,170
All right.
Four thousand dollars.

185
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:22,675
I take it, uh, you can prove that
that car is yours.

186
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:26,387
- I mean, out of state license and all.
- I have all the necessary papers.

187
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,016
- Is... Is there a ladies' room?
- L-In the building.

188
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:32,124
Thank you.

189
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,126
Hey!

190
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,589
Forgot your bag.

191
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:40,926
Put 'em in the back, please.

192
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:52,687
Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer...

193
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:54,689
...high-pressure the salesman.

194
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,692
Is somebody chasin' her?

195
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,694
I'd better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

196
00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:03,156
- She look like a bad one to you?
- Acted like one.

197
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:06,661
Funny thing is,
she paid me in cash.

198
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:18,882
Yes, Mr. Lowery?

199
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:21,885
Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

200
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,557
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

201
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,893
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

202
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:32,605
Call her sister.
If no one's answering at the house...

203
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:36,610
I called her sister where she works...
Hard Core Vinyl Record Store.

204
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:39,613
She doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

205
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,615
Run out to the house.

206
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,619
She may be unable to answer the phone.

207
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,913
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

208
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:52,334
No, I haven't
the faintest idea.

209
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:55,338
I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

210
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,800
She said she didn't feel well, wanted
to leave early and I said she could.

211
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:03,221
That was the last I saw...
Wait a minute.

212
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:06,224
I did see her some time later, driving.

213
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:09,895
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

214
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:13,191
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

215
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,651
Quick.

216
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,905
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $400,000.

217
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,909
I'll get it back,
and if any of it's missin'...

218
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,912
I'll replace it
with her fine, soft flesh.

219
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:27,915
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

220
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,584
A girl works for you for ten years,
you trust her.

221
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,588
It must be some kind of a mystery.
I can't...

222
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,591
Check with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her.

223
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:38,593
You still trust her?
Hot creepers, man.

224
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:41,597
She sat there while I dumped it out,
hardly even looked at it...

225
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,850
...plannin', and even flirtin' with me.

226
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:50,314
You trust her.

227
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:13,758
Gee, I'm sorry.
I- I didn't hear you in all this rain.

228
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,761
Go on in, please.

229
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:22,726
- It's a dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

230
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,937
Oh, we have 12, in fact.

231
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,940
Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies.

232
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,069
They moved away the highway.

233
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:34,614
- Oh, I thought I had gotten off the main road.
- I knew you must've.

234
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:37,618
No one ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

235
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:40,288
Oh.

236
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:43,291
Ah, but it's no use
dwelling on our losses.

237
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:48,130
We just keep on lightin' the lights
and following the formalities.

238
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,925
Uh, and, uh,
your home address.

239
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,345
Town will do.

240
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,725
Los Angeles.

241
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,148
Cabin one.

242
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,818
It's closer, in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.

243
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,030
Oh, I want sleep more than
anything else. Except maybe food.

244
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,577
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside Fairvale.

245
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,955
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles.

246
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,124
I'll get your bags for you.

247
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:45,358
Uh, it's stuffy in here.

248
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,699
Well, the mattress is soft,
and there's hangers in the closet...

249
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:56,702
...and there's stationery
with "Bates Motel" written on it...

250
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:59,705
...just in case you want to make
your friends back home envious.

251
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,624
Ah. Mmm.

252
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,794
And, um...

253
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,796
...uh, the, uh...

254
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:09,216
Over there.

255
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:11,760
- The bathroom.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:16,765
If you want anything at all just tap on
the wall, 'cause I'll be in the office.

257
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:19,643
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.
- Norman Bates.

258
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:23,690
- You have something that most girls don't have.
- I have?

259
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:28,528
There's not a name for it, but it's
something that puts a person at ease.

260
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,699
Well, thank you again.

261
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,411
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to that diner, are you?

262
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,164
- No.
- Would you do me a favor, then?

263
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:41,168
Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.

264
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,003
Nothing special.
Just sandwiches and milk.

265
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:45,755
But I'd like it if you came up
to the house.

266
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:49,759
I don't set a fancy table or anything,
but, uh, the kitchen's awful homey.

267
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,347
- I'd like to.
- All right.

268
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:57,559
Well, then you get settled in,
take off your wet shoes...

269
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:00,563
...and I'll be back
as soon as it's ready...

270
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,482
...with my trusty umbrella.

271
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:18,855
No, I tell you! No!

272
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:22,191
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper.

273
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,277
By candlelight, I suppose...

274
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,323
...in the cheap, erotic fashion
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

275
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,325
Mother, please!

276
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,327
And then what?

277
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,329
After supper, music?
Whispers?

278
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,666
Mother, she's just a stranger.

279
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,335
She's hungry,
and it's raining out.

280
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,254
"Mother, she was just a stranger. "

281
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,798
As if men don't desire strangers.
As if...

282
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:48,303
Well, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

283
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,305
Do you understand, boy?

284
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:55,978
Go on. Tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite with my food or my son.

285
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,981
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

286
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,233
Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:03,736
Shut up!

288
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:40,233
I've caused you
some trouble.

289
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:44,571
No, uh, Mother...
my mother...

290
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,573
Oh, what's the phrase?

291
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:50,577
She isn't quite herself today.

292
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:54,415
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

293
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:57,418
I- I really don't have that much
of an appetite.

294
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,420
Uh, I'm sorry.

295
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:02,340
I wish I could apologize
for other people.

296
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:04,343
Don't worry about it.

297
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,350
Well, as long as
you've fixed us supper...

298
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,062
...we might as well eat it, huh?

299
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:27,826
It might be nicer and warmer...

300
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:29,828
...in the office.

301
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:50,349
It's stopped raining.

302
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:54,396
Eating in an office is just...
too officious.

303
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,815
I have the parlor back here.

304
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,817
All right.

305
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:17,671
Sit down.

306
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:28,892
Thank you.

307
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,062
You're very kind.

308
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:33,814
Oh, it's all for you.

309
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,816
Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

310
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,785
You eat like a bird.

311
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:48,787
You would know, of course.

312
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,790
Not really.

313
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:54,794
I hear that the expression "eats
like a bird" is really a falsity...

314
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:57,922
...because birds really eat
a tremendous lot.

315
00:32:57,964 --> 00:33:01,093
I don't really know
anything about birds.

316
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:03,762
My hobby is stuffing things.

317
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:05,931
You know... Taxidermy.

318
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,439
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I guess
I'd rather stuff birds...

319
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,360
...well, because I hate the look
of beasts when they're stuffed.

320
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:19,363
You know?

321
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,991
Foxes and chimps?

322
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:25,953
Some people even stuff dogs and cats.
I couldn't do that.

323
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:29,791
No, I-I-I think only birds
look well stuffed...

324
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,919
...because, um, they're kind of passive
to begin with.

325
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:38,424
That's a strange hobby.
Curious.

326
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,092
It's uncommon too.

327
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,511
I imagine so.

328
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:45,514
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really.

329
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:48,643
Uh, needles, thread, sawdust.

330
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:52,272
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

331
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:54,274
A man should have a hobby.

332
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,651
Oh, it's more than a hobby.

333
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:59,655
A hobby's supposed to pass your time,
not fill it.

334
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,574
Is your time so empty?

335
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:04,118
No. I run the office.

336
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,120
Tend the cabins, grounds.

337
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:08,624
Do little errands
for my mother...

338
00:34:08,665 --> 00:34:11,376
...the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

339
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,296
Don't you go out
w- with friends?

340
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:17,258
Uh, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

341
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:25,058
You haven't had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

342
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,061
Only my share.

343
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:29,105
Where are you goin'?

344
00:34:30,356 --> 00:34:32,524
I didn't mean to pry.

345
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,779
I'm looking for
a private island.

346
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,491
What are you running away from?

347
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,700
Why...
Why do you ask that?

348
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,205
No.

349
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:48,374
People never run away
from anything.

350
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:53,462
Rain didn't last long, did it?

351
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:56,299
You know what I think?

352
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:59,261
I think we're all in our private traps,
clamped in 'em.

353
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,680
We can never get out.

354
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:06,394
Oh, we scratch and claw,
but only at the air...

355
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:08,729
...only at each other.

356
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:13,401
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

357
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:16,530
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

358
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,908
I was born into mine.

359
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,162
But I don't mind it anymore.

360
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:26,458
Well, you should.
You should mind.

361
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,918
I do.

362
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,588
I just...
I say that I don't.

363
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,595
Y- You know, if anyone
ever spoke to me...

364
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,015
...the way I heard...
the way she talked to you, I...

365
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,312
Sometimes when she
talks to me like that...

366
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,315
I feel like I could curse her out
and leave her forever.

367
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,358
Or at least defy her.

368
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,196
Well, but I know I can't.

369
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,198
She's ill.

370
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,991
She sounded strong.

371
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,913
Uh, no.
I mean, ill.

372
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,543
She had to raise me all by herself
after my father died.

373
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:12,047
I was only five.
Must've been quite a strain for her.

374
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,593
It's not like she had to go to work
or anything like that.

375
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,595
H- He left her a little money.

376
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:19,806
Anyway, um...

377
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:23,477
...a few years ago
Mother met this man.

378
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:27,522
He talked her into
building this motel.

379
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:30,024
He could've talked her
into anything.

380
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,572
And when he died too,
it was just...

381
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:39,284
...just too great of a shock for her.

382
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:41,287
And the way that he died...

383
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:47,502
I- I guess it's nothing you should be
talking about when you're eating.

384
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:49,878
But, anyway, uh...

385
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:52,882
...it was just too great
of a loss for her...

386
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:56,636
...and, you know,
she had nothin' left.

387
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:59,013
Except you.

388
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:01,016
Yeah.

389
00:37:02,226 --> 00:37:05,229
A son's a poor substitute
for a lover.

390
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:07,940
Why don't you go away?

391
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:11,111
- To a private island, like you?
- No. No.

392
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:13,738
Not like me.
Just...

393
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,202
I couldn't do that.

394
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:22,039
Who'd take care of her?

395
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,709
She'd be all alone up there.

396
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:26,835
The fire'd go out.

397
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,964
It'd be cold and damp...

398
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,966
...like a grave.

399
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:36,721
If you love someone,
you can't do that to 'em.

400
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:40,058
Even if you hate 'em.

401
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,521
Understand, I...

402
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,734
I don't hate her.

403
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:51,154
I hate what she's become.

404
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,448
I hate the illness.

405
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:57,409
Well, wouldn't it be better...

406
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:59,412
...i- if y... if you...

407
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:04,459
...if you put her someplace or...

408
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:08,380
Do you mean an institution?

409
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,549
A madhouse?

410
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:17,348
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

411
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:20,477
Put her in... Someplace.

412
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,396
I'm sor...
I didn't mean to sound uncaring. L...

413
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:28,401
What do you know about caring? Have you
ever seen the inside of one of those places?

414
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:31,404
The laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you?

415
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:33,198
My mother, in there?

416
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,534
She's harmless.

417
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,538
She's as harmless as one
of these stuffed birds.

418
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:42,458
I am sorry, I...

419
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,460
I on... I only felt I...

420
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:47,631
- You felt what?
- It seemed that she was... She's hurting you.

421
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:51,009
L... I meant well.

422
00:38:52,803 --> 00:38:55,764
People always mean well.

423
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:59,560
They cluck their thick tongues
and they shake their heads...

424
00:38:59,643 --> 00:39:03,689
...and they suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

425
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:15,828
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

426
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,831
I hate to think about it.
She needs me.

427
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,751
It's not as if she were a maniac
or a raving thing.

428
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,838
She just...

429
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:27,840
...goes a little mad sometimes.

430
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:30,801
We all go a little mad sometimes.

431
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,803
Haven't you?

432
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,349
Yes.

433
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:41,396
Sometimes only one time
can be enough.

434
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,398
Thank you.

435
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,526
Oh, um...
Thank you, Norman?

436
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:48,196
Norman.

437
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:51,199
You're not goin' back
to your room already.

438
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,201
Oh, I'm very tired...

439
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:56,288
...and I have a very long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

440
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:58,791
Really.

441
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:01,293
I stepped into
a private trap back there...

442
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:05,631
...and I'd like to go and try to pull myself
out of it before it's too late for me too.

443
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:08,634
Well, you sure you don't wanna stay
just a little while longer...

444
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:10,636
...just for talk?

445
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,724
Well, I'd like to, but...

446
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:17,227
All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

447
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:19,853
I'll bring you some breakfast.
What time?

448
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,855
Very early.
Dawn.

449
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:26,361
All right,
Miss, um, uh...

450
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:28,655
Crane.

451
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:31,616
Crane.
That's it.

452
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,619
Good night.

453
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,909
Mother?

454
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:44,121
Oh, God!
Blood! Blood!

455
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:46,123
Blood, blood,
blood, blood...

456
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:48,126
...blood, blood,
blood, blood.

457
00:57:51,688 --> 00:57:55,359
They tell you
what the ingredients are...

458
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:59,906
...and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
any insect in the world...

459
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:03,701
...but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

460
00:58:03,743 --> 00:58:08,415
I believe, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

461
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,751
Wow.

462
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:28,270
- Sam.
- Sam, there's a lady here for you.

463
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:37,530
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

464
00:58:37,613 --> 00:58:41,408
- Oh. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

465
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:45,913
- Of course not. Is something wrong?
- She left home on Friday.

466
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,958
I was in Tucson over the weekend, and I
haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.

467
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,295
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care. It's none of my business.

468
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:55,007
But I wanna talk to Marion, and I want
her to tell me it's none of my business.

469
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,634
- And then I'll go!
- Uh, Bob!

470
00:58:57,676 --> 00:59:00,971
- Run out and get yourself lunch.
- That's okay. I brought it with me.

471
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:02,806
Run out and eat it.

472
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,483
Now what... what thing
could we be in on together?

473
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,486
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

474
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:18,490
Is Marion in trouble?
Or, what is it?

475
00:59:18,574 --> 00:59:21,327
Let's all talk
about Marion, shall we?

476
00:59:24,455 --> 00:59:26,832
Who are you, friend?

477
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:32,171
My name's Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.

478
00:59:32,213 --> 00:59:34,883
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

479
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:37,885
I know you don't. If you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

480
00:59:37,968 --> 00:59:40,387
W- What's your interest in this?

481
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:42,891
Four hundred thousand dollars.

482
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:47,229
- Four hundred thousand dollars?
- That's right.

483
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:50,232
One of you better tell me
what's going on here and tell me fast.

484
00:59:50,315 --> 00:59:53,236
- I can... I can take just so much of this.
- Just take it easy, friend.

485
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:55,363
Your girlfriend stole $400,000.

486
00:59:55,446 --> 00:59:58,533
What are you talking about?
What is this?

487
00:59:58,616 --> 01:00:01,536
She was supposed to bank it
on Friday for her boss.

488
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:04,164
She didn't.
No one has seen her since.

489
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:06,208
Oh, someone's seen her.

490
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:09,461
Someone always sees a girl
with $400,000.

491
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:13,341
Sam, they don't wanna prosecute. They just
want the money back. So if she's here, tell us.

492
01:00:13,383 --> 01:00:16,386
She's not. She isn't.
She ain't here.

493
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:18,721
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

494
01:00:18,805 --> 01:00:21,392
Did you come all the way up here
on a hunch and nothing more?

495
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,352
Not even a hunch.
Just hope.

496
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:26,271
You know, with a little checking,
I could get to believe you.

497
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:28,815
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

498
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:32,778
All I wanna do is find Marion
before she gets into this too deeply.

499
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:35,531
Yeah. Did you check in Phoenix?
In the hospitals?

500
01:00:35,573 --> 01:00:39,534
- Maybe she had an accident or a holdup.
- No.

501
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:42,788
She was seen leaving town in her car,
by her employer, I might add.

502
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:46,292
Well, I can't believe it.
Can you?

503
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,752
Well, you know...

504
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:53,133
...we're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.

505
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,135
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

506
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,971
Where there's a boyfriend...

507
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:02,768
Well, she's not back there with the nuts
and bolts, but she's here in this town.

508
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:06,397
Somewhere.
I'll find her.

509
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:16,658
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

510
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:36,011
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

511
01:01:36,094 --> 01:01:39,974
- I almost drove right past.
- Yeah, I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on.

512
01:01:40,016 --> 01:01:42,268
But we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.

513
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,647
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Some candy?

514
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:47,649
No, thanks.

515
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:51,153
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels, my eyes are bleary with the neon.

516
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:53,155
But you know,
this is the first one...

517
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:55,658
...that looks like
it's hiding from the world.

518
01:01:55,699 --> 01:01:57,827
I didn't really forget
to turn the sign on.

519
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:00,163
It just doesn't seem
like much use anymore.

520
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:05,377
You know, that used to be
the main highway right over there.

521
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,880
- Wanna come in and register?
- No. No, no, no. Sit down.

522
01:02:07,964 --> 01:02:10,550
Don't wanna trouble you.
Just wanna ask you some questions.

523
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:12,593
No trouble at all.
Today's linen day.

524
01:02:12,677 --> 01:02:16,264
I change the beds here once a week,
whether they've been used or not.

525
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:18,433
I just hate the smell
of dampness, you know?

526
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:22,020
Such a... I don't know...
kind of a creepy smell.

527
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:24,982
Come on.

528
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:29,320
- You out to buy a motel?
- Uh, no.

529
01:02:29,362 --> 01:02:32,322
The reason I ask is because you said
you'd seen so many in the past couple days.

530
01:02:32,364 --> 01:02:34,533
I thought maybe you...
What was it you wanted to ask me?

531
01:02:34,575 --> 01:02:36,535
Looking for a missing person.

532
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:40,497
- My name's Arbogast. I'm a
private investigator. - Mm-hmm.

533
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:44,626
I'm trying to trace a girl that's been
missing for, oh, about a week now.

534
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:49,257
- Mm-hmm.
- From Phoenix. It's a private matter.

535
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,302
Family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.

536
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:55,305
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in any trouble.

537
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:57,975
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah. Private investigator.

538
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,730
Uh, we have reason to believe
she came along this way.

539
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:07,027
Might've stopped in the area.
Did, uh, she stop here?

540
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:09,738
No one's stopped here
for a couple weeks.

541
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:12,782
- Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
- Commit myself?

542
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:16,579
- You sure sound like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

543
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,915
- Mm-mm.
- You're sure.

544
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,917
Yeah.

545
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,586
Well, it's possible
she used an alias.

546
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:27,633
Marion Crane is her real name, but she
could've registered under a different one.

547
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:31,260
I don't even bother registering people anymore.
One by one, you sort of drop formalities.

548
01:03:31,302 --> 01:03:35,265
I shouldn't even be changing the sheets,
but old habits die hard.

549
01:03:35,307 --> 01:03:37,267
Oh, which reminds me.

550
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:41,020
- What's that?
- The lights. The sign.

551
01:03:41,103 --> 01:03:43,773
We had a couple last week, said if it hadn't
been on, they would've driven right past.

552
01:03:43,814 --> 01:03:47,486
- It looked like a deserted...
- Now, you see, that's my point.

553
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:49,488
You said, nobody had been here
for a couple of weeks.

554
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:51,490
Now there's this couple
came by, and...

555
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:54,035
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They didn't know you were open.

556
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:57,080
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

557
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:59,457
It's possible this girl registered
under a different name.

558
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,627
- Could I look at your book?
- Mm-hmm.

559
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:04,630
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

560
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:08,676
I got the, uh...
got the date here somewhere.

561
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:10,970
See? There's no one there.

562
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,348
I got a sample
of her handwriting.

563
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:24,235
Oh, yeah, here we are. "Marie Samuels. "
That's an interesting alias.

564
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,988
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

565
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:32,493
Marie... Marion. Samuels.
Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

566
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,663
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
You wanna look at the picture again?

567
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,666
Look, Mr. Arbogast,
I'm not lying to you. It's just that...

568
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,501
No, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

569
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:44,213
It's just i-i-it's hard
to keep track of time around here.

570
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,841
Oh, I know, I know.

571
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,222
Oh, yeah.

572
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:57,477
Yeah, it was raining that night,
and her hair was all wet.

573
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,147
And I'll tell ya, that's not
a very good picture of her either.

574
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,900
No, I guess not.

575
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:05,445
- At all.
- I guess not. Tell me all about her.

576
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:09,532
Well, she arrived rather late
one night and went to sleep...

577
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:11,493
...and left early in the morning.

578
01:05:11,535 --> 01:05:13,495
- How early?
- Very early.

579
01:05:13,537 --> 01:05:16,540
- Which morning was this?
- The next day, so, Sunday.

580
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:21,338
- Mm-hmm. Did, uh, anyone meet her here?
- Uh-uh.

581
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:24,049
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- Nope.

582
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:28,010
- Did she make any phone calls or, uh...
- Mm-mm.

583
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:30,222
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

584
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:33,183
- You spend the night with her?
- No.

585
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:37,229
Well, then, how do you know she didn't
make any phone calls?

586
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,522
Well, we, um...

587
01:05:39,564 --> 01:05:44,070
Well, she-she was
very tired, and...

588
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:46,530
I- I... I'm starting
to remember it now.

589
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:51,410
I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

590
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:55,289
Do you know how you do that? How you
make a mental picturization of something?

591
01:05:55,373 --> 01:05:57,291
That's right.
Take your time.

592
01:05:57,375 --> 01:06:02,047
She was, uh...
Yeah, she was sitting back there.

593
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:06,260
Mm-mm. She was standing back there,
and she had a sandwich in her hand...

594
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:10,223
...and she said that she had
a long drive ahead of her...

595
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:13,726
...so she went to bed,
uh, straight to bed.

596
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:15,853
- Back where?
- Back from where she came from.

597
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:19,149
You said before, she was sitting
or standing "back there"?

598
01:06:19,233 --> 01:06:21,402
Yes. In my parlor back there.

599
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:24,153
She said she was very hungry,
so I made her a sandwich...

600
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:29,076
...and, uh, she, uh, said she was tired
and went straight to sleep.

601
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,078
Oh, I see.

602
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,122
How'd she pay you?
A check, cash?

603
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:36,959
- Cash.
- Oh, cash, huh? Hmm.

604
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:40,255
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Why would she?

605
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:43,258
Yeah.

606
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,343
Well, I guess that's about it,
Mr. Arbogast.

607
01:06:45,427 --> 01:06:48,097
So, uh, I got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

608
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:50,099
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

609
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:54,144
If it don't jell, it ain't Jell-O,
and this just ain't jelling.

610
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:57,607
It's not coming together somehow.
Something's missing.

611
01:06:57,648 --> 01:07:00,651
I don't know what else you could expect
me to know. People just come and go.

612
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:04,780
That's right.
She's not still here, is she?

613
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:07,534
- No.
- Mm.

614
01:07:07,618 --> 01:07:11,872
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12
of 'em, would I need a warrant for that?

615
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:16,669
If you don't believe me, you can help me
change the beds, if you like.

616
01:07:16,711 --> 01:07:20,340
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

617
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:44,365
Change your mind?

618
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:48,536
You know, I must have one of those faces
you just can't help believing.

619
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,538
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

620
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,291
Oh, there's someone
sitting up in the window.

621
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,878
- No, there isn't.
- Oh, sure, go ahead, take a look.

622
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,382
Oh, that-that's my mother.
She's an in... invalid.

623
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:04,135
An inval... An invalid.
It's practically like living alone.

624
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:06,764
Oh, I see.

625
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:10,226
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would ya?

626
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:16,149
- No.
- Not even if she paid you a lot of money?

627
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:18,235
- No.
- Well, let's just say...

628
01:08:18,277 --> 01:08:21,571
...for the sake of argument, that she
wanted you to gallantly protect her.

629
01:08:21,612 --> 01:08:24,575
You'd know you were being used. You
wouldn't be made a fool of, would ya?

630
01:08:24,616 --> 01:08:28,912
I'm not a fool. I'm not capable of
being made a fool, not even by a woman.

631
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:30,914
It's not a slur on your manhood.
I'm sorry.

632
01:08:30,956 --> 01:08:35,461
Let's put it this way. She might've made a
fool of me, but she didn't fool my mother.

633
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:37,463
Well, then, your mother met her?
Could I talk to your mother?

634
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:39,549
- As I just told you, she-she's confined.
- Yeah.

635
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:42,135
But just for a few minutes.
L... That's all.

636
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,930
There might be some hint
that you overlooked.

637
01:08:45,014 --> 01:08:46,974
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

638
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:49,476
Mr. Arbogast,
I- I explained to you now...

639
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,770
Just for a moment.
I wouldn't disturb her.

640
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:54,274
I've talked to you
all I want to.

641
01:08:54,316 --> 01:08:59,446
- Yes, but just for one moment.
- I think it'd be much better if you left now.

642
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:04,659
Okay. You know, you'd save me a lot of legwork
if you'd just let me talk to her about...

643
01:09:04,743 --> 01:09:06,870
- Do I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

644
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:09,873
All right.
Thanks anyway.

645
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:51,543
Oh! Hello, Loomis?
It's Arbogast. Is Lila there?

646
01:09:51,627 --> 01:09:54,046
Can I talk to her, please?

647
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:59,760
Hello, Lila. Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

648
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,764
Yep. She spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

649
01:10:02,847 --> 01:10:04,766
It's out here
on the old highway.

650
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:08,269
I even know what cabin she was in.
Cabin number one.

651
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:11,189
Well, the young fella
that runs the place said...

652
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:14,192
...she just spent the night,
left the next day, and that was it.

653
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,902
No. No, not exactly.

654
01:10:16,986 --> 01:10:19,071
Well, I did question him.
Believe me.

655
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:21,074
I think I got
all there was to get.

656
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:23,827
I'll have to pick up
the pieces from here.

657
01:10:25,203 --> 01:10:29,165
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied.

658
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:31,627
See, this boy has
a sick old mother.

659
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:34,630
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

660
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:39,636
No. No. Unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

661
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,182
Well, I was. I think
I'll go back to the motel first.

662
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:47,561
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in an hour.

663
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:49,564
All right.

664
01:11:37,281 --> 01:11:39,241
Bates?

665
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:12,698
Sometimes, Saturday night has
a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

666
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,702
Sam, please.
He said an hour or less.

667
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,331
Yep.
Been three.

668
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,334
Are we just gonna sit here
and wait?

669
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:29,298
He'll be back.
Sit still.

670
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,301
Hang on.

671
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:36,347
How far is it to the old highway?

672
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:40,101
You wanna go out there, don't ya?
Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.

673
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,187
- Maybe scare her a little bit.
- Yeah.

674
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:46,609
- Wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family. I'm going out there.

675
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,820
- Arbogast said...
- An hour or less.

676
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:52,324
All right.
I'll call out there.

677
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:01,667
Well, I'm goin'.

678
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:05,170
You'll never find it.

679
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:06,671
- Lila.
- What?

680
01:15:06,713 --> 01:15:10,343
- I'll go. You stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

681
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:12,845
I don't know. One of us has to be here
in case he's on the way.

682
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,431
What am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

683
01:15:15,514 --> 01:15:18,768
Yeah.

684
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:20,771
Have another beer.

685
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:40,541
Mr. Arbogast?

686
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:44,796
Mr. Arbogast?

687
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:50,052
Arbogast!

688
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:09,572
- Did he come back here?
- Sam.

689
01:16:09,656 --> 01:16:13,201
No Arbogast. No Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

690
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:17,247
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

691
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:19,417
Where could he have gone?

692
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,420
Maybe he had a lead.
Maybe he went right on ahead and...

693
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,797
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

694
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,926
Sam, he called when he had nothing,
nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

695
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:31,929
Don't you think he would've called
if he had anything at all?

696
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:36,434
Yeah, I think
he would have.

697
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:38,687
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

698
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:40,939
He's our deputy sheriff
around here.

699
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:42,941
Let me get my Walkman.

700
01:16:46,946 --> 01:16:49,782
Now, your sister's
been missing how long?

701
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:52,577
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

702
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:56,915
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

703
01:16:56,957 --> 01:17:00,628
Uh, they thought
that she'd be coming to me.

704
01:17:00,711 --> 01:17:03,463
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yeah.

705
01:17:03,504 --> 01:17:07,426
Then she's not missing
so much as she's run away.

706
01:17:07,468 --> 01:17:10,429
- Yeah, that's right.
- From what?

707
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:14,141
She stole some money.

708
01:17:14,224 --> 01:17:17,187
- A lot?
- Four hundred thousand dollars.

709
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:20,815
And the police haven't
been able to...

710
01:17:20,857 --> 01:17:23,276
Everyone concerned thought that if they
could get her to give the money back...

711
01:17:23,318 --> 01:17:26,447
...they could avoid involving her
with the police.

712
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:29,784
Explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

713
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:31,827
What exactly did he say
when he called?

714
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:34,831
He said that Marion stayed there
for one night, and then she left.

715
01:17:34,873 --> 01:17:36,832
With the $400,000?

716
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:39,502
He didn't say anything about the money.
It's not important what he said on the phone.

717
01:17:39,543 --> 01:17:42,505
He was supposed to come back after he
talked to the mother, and he didn't.

718
01:17:42,546 --> 01:17:46,343
- That's what I want you to do something about.
- Like what?

719
01:17:46,426 --> 01:17:48,345
I- I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

720
01:17:48,428 --> 01:17:51,682
It's just that something is wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

721
01:17:51,765 --> 01:17:55,144
Well, I think there's something
wrong too, but not the same thing.

722
01:17:55,186 --> 01:17:57,313
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

723
01:17:57,355 --> 01:18:00,190
I think he got a hot lead
as to where your sister was going...

724
01:18:00,232 --> 01:18:02,192
...probably from Norman Bates...

725
01:18:02,234 --> 01:18:05,863
...and called to keep you still while he
took off after your sister and the money.

726
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:09,033
No, he said he was dissatisfied
and was going back there.

727
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:12,495
Why don't you call Norman
and just let him say what happened?

728
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:21,755
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

729
01:18:24,926 --> 01:18:27,721
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

730
01:18:27,762 --> 01:18:31,099
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.

731
01:18:31,182 --> 01:18:34,145
Did you have a fellow
stop out there tonight?

732
01:18:34,228 --> 01:18:36,606
No, this one wouldn't be
a customer anyway.

733
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:39,066
- It's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

734
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,067
Arbogast.

735
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:47,116
And after he left?

736
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,243
No, that's okay, Norman.

737
01:18:49,285 --> 01:18:51,245
Well, this detective was there.

738
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:54,916
Norman told him about the girl,
the detective thanked him, went away.

739
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,586
He didn't come back?
Didn't see the mother?

740
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:01,923
Your detective told you that
he couldn't come back right away...

741
01:19:02,007 --> 01:19:04,426
...because he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother?

742
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:06,303
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

743
01:19:06,386 --> 01:19:08,388
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

744
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,058
...in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

745
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:15,938
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

746
01:19:16,022 --> 01:19:18,983
It ain't only local history, Sam.

747
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:23,989
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on the Fairvale ledgers.

748
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:27,117
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with...

749
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,787
- when she found out he was married.
- Oh.

750
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:33,124
Then she took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

751
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:37,087
Strychnine.
An ugly way to die.

752
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:40,006
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.

753
01:19:42,426 --> 01:19:47,347
You mean, that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window is not Norman Bates' mother?

754
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:50,977
Now just a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

755
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:53,980
Yeah. In the house
behind the motel.

756
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:57,983
I called and pounded,
but she just ignored me.

757
01:19:58,024 --> 01:20:02,571
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates...

758
01:20:02,655 --> 01:20:05,825
...who's that woman buried
out in Green Lawn Cemetery?

759
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:48,998
Mother, I, uh,
have to take you downstairs.

760
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,125
I am sorry, boy...

761
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:55,836
...but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

762
01:20:55,878 --> 01:21:01,801
- Please, Mother.
- No, I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

763
01:21:01,885 --> 01:21:05,722
Think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.

764
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:09,060
This is my room,
and no one will drag me out of it...

765
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:11,896
...least of all my big, bold son.

766
01:21:11,937 --> 01:21:13,898
They'll come now, Mother.

767
01:21:13,939 --> 01:21:17,194
He came after the girl.
Now someone will come after him.

768
01:21:17,235 --> 01:21:21,073
Mother, please,
it's just for a few days.

769
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:23,575
Just for a few days
so they don't find you.

770
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:26,244
"Just for a few days. "

771
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:28,247
In that dank fruit cellar?

772
01:21:28,331 --> 01:21:32,251
No! You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again.

773
01:21:32,293 --> 01:21:37,883
Get out! Norman, what do you think
you're going to do?

774
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:40,844
Don't you touch me.
Don't!

775
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:44,598
Put me down,
and I'll walk on my own.

776
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:57,736
Guess we better decide what we're gonna
say and do when we walk in there.

777
01:21:57,778 --> 01:22:01,281
We're gonna register
as man and wife...

778
01:22:01,323 --> 01:22:03,534
...and then we're gonna
get shown to a cabin...

779
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:08,331
...and we're gonna search every inch
of that place inside and out.

780
01:22:29,271 --> 01:22:32,357
Nope. I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting?

781
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:35,361
Someone's in the window.
I just saw something move.

782
01:22:37,363 --> 01:22:40,158
- Well.
- We were just coming up to ring for you.

783
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:42,160
Suppose you want a room.

784
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:45,122
Yeah, we were gonna try to make it
all the way to San Francisco...

785
01:22:45,164 --> 01:22:47,625
...but we don't like
the look of that sky.

786
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,793
Looks like a bad day coming up.

787
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,795
Okay.

788
01:22:57,926 --> 01:23:00,219
Take you to cabin ten.

789
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:03,515
- Uh, better sign in first.
- No, it isn't necessary.

790
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:07,645
No, my boss paid
for this trip...

791
01:23:07,686 --> 01:23:11,065
...and it's 90% business...

792
01:23:11,148 --> 01:23:13,276
...so he wants practically
notarized receipts.

793
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,279
I think we better sign in
and get a receipt.

794
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:17,989
Mm-hmm.

795
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:23,913
Thank you.

796
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:30,753
- All right.
- All right.

797
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:32,881
I'll get your bags.

798
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:35,092
Uh, haven't any.

799
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:37,427
I'll show you
to your room then.

800
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,429
First time I ever seen
that happen.

801
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:45,061
You check into any place in this country
without a bag, you got to pay in advance.

802
01:23:46,437 --> 01:23:50,065
- Thirty-six dollars and fifty cents.
- All righty.

803
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,408
All righty.

804
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:01,203
That receipt?

805
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:05,373
I'll go on ahead.

806
01:24:08,584 --> 01:24:11,255
There's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

807
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:14,591
Nah, that's okay.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

808
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,081
We gotta go in there
and search that cabin, Sam...

809
01:24:43,123 --> 01:24:46,334
...no matter what we're afraid of finding,
or how much it may hurt.

810
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:48,336
I know.

811
01:24:48,419 --> 01:24:50,964
You think if something happened,
it happened here?

812
01:24:51,006 --> 01:24:54,384
I don't know. If you had
a useless business like this motel...

813
01:24:54,468 --> 01:24:58,931
...what would it take to get out,
get a new business someplace else?

814
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:01,643
Four hundred thousand dollars?

815
01:25:02,977 --> 01:25:05,647
Well, how can we prove that?

816
01:25:05,688 --> 01:25:07,814
There's got to be some proof
that exists right now...

817
01:25:07,898 --> 01:25:10,485
...something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

818
01:25:10,526 --> 01:25:15,031
What makes
you sound so certain?

819
01:25:15,114 --> 01:25:18,201
Arbogast.
He liked me, Sam.

820
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:20,204
Felt sorry for me. He was starting
to feel the same way about you.

821
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:22,665
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

822
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:25,334
He wouldn't have gone anywhere without
telling us unless he was stopped.

823
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,171
And he was stopped,
so he must've found out something.

824
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:31,675
All right.
We'll start with cabin one.

825
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:09,048
Bates?

826
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:51,926
No shower curtain.

827
01:26:51,968 --> 01:26:53,928
Sam, look.

828
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:56,766
- What is it?
- Figuring that didn't get washed down.

829
01:26:56,849 --> 01:27:00,186
Look, some figure's been added to
or subtracted from 400,000.

830
01:27:00,269 --> 01:27:02,271
Proves Marion was here.
It's too wild a coincidence.

831
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:06,109
Wait a minute.
Bates never denied she was here.

832
01:27:06,193 --> 01:27:08,612
Uh...

833
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:12,908
Doesn't it prove he found out
about the money?

834
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:15,536
- Should we ask him where he's hidden it?
- No.

835
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,747
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

836
01:27:18,789 --> 01:27:20,749
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

837
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:23,460
- Hey, you can't go up there.
- Why not?

838
01:27:23,543 --> 01:27:25,630
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

839
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:28,257
One of us can keep him occupied, and
the other one can get to the old woman.

840
01:27:28,299 --> 01:27:31,260
You won't be able to hold him still,
if he doesn't wanna be held.

841
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:33,430
I don't like you going
up in that house alone.

842
01:27:33,472 --> 01:27:36,934
I can handle a sick old woman.

843
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:40,645
All right. I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

844
01:27:56,413 --> 01:27:58,623
- Looking for me?
- Uh, yeah, matter of fact.

845
01:27:58,665 --> 01:28:02,127
Uh, wife's taking a nap,
and, uh...

846
01:28:02,168 --> 01:28:04,672
I can never keep
quiet enough for her...

847
01:28:04,755 --> 01:28:08,175
...so I thought maybe
I'd look you up and talk.

848
01:28:08,259 --> 01:28:11,721
Good.
Satisfied with your cabin?

849
01:28:11,804 --> 01:28:14,349
Oh, it's fine.

850
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:10,159
Mrs. Bates?

851
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:12,953
You're alone here,
aren't you?

852
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:15,122
It would drive me crazy.

853
01:29:15,206 --> 01:29:18,084
That'd be a rather extreme reaction,
don't you think?

854
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:22,089
That's just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do just about anything to get away.

855
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,424
Wouldn't you?

856
01:29:24,507 --> 01:29:26,425
No.

857
01:29:26,509 --> 01:29:29,346
Mrs. Bates?

858
01:29:32,224 --> 01:29:34,975
Mrs. Bates?

859
01:30:33,288 --> 01:30:36,708
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented
here. I'm just doubtin' that you are.

860
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:41,672
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under here, you'd unload this place.

861
01:30:41,714 --> 01:30:43,924
"This place"?

862
01:30:44,008 --> 01:30:46,678
This place happens to be
my only world.

863
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,931
See, I grew up in that house up there
and had a very happy childhood.

864
01:30:50,015 --> 01:30:53,393
My mother and me...
were more than happy.

865
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:38,149
You seem frightened.
Am I saying something frightening?

866
01:31:38,233 --> 01:31:40,151
I don't know
what you're saying.

867
01:31:40,235 --> 01:31:43,655
I'm talkin' about your mother,
about your motel.

868
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:47,827
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

869
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:51,080
Buy a new one, in a new town...

870
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:54,083
...where you won't
have to hide your mother.

871
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:58,046
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here.

872
01:31:58,088 --> 01:32:01,091
Where you gonna get that kind of money?
Or, do you already have it somewhere?

873
01:32:01,174 --> 01:32:04,220
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Huh?

874
01:32:04,262 --> 01:32:07,223
A lot of it.
Four hundred thousand dollars.

875
01:32:07,265 --> 01:32:10,643
I bet your mother knows where it is
and what you did to get it.

876
01:32:10,727 --> 01:32:13,647
Where's that girl
that you came here with?

877
01:32:15,524 --> 01:32:17,818
I'll bet she'll tell us.

878
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,607
Mrs. Bates?

879
01:34:42,723 --> 01:34:44,641
So, Norman.

880
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:48,437
If anybody can get any answers,
it'll be the psychiatrist.

881
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,816
Even I couldn't get to Norman,
and he knows me.

882
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,778
You warm enough, miss?

883
01:34:55,861 --> 01:34:59,324
Did he talk to you?

884
01:34:59,407 --> 01:35:01,743
No.

885
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:05,955
I got the whole story,
but not from Norman.

886
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:07,958
I got it from his mother.

887
01:35:08,042 --> 01:35:11,128
Norman Bates no longer exists.

888
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:14,298
He only half-existed
to begin with.

889
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,302
Now, the other half
has taken over.

890
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,304
Probably for all time.

891
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:22,306
- Did he kill my sister?
- Yes.

892
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:25,976
I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

893
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:29,481
If you drag the swamp
in the vicinity of the motel...

894
01:35:32,025 --> 01:35:36,154
To understand it as I understood it,
hearing it from the "mother"...

895
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:39,325
...that is, the mother-half
of Norman's mind...

896
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:41,369
...you have to go back ten years...

897
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:45,164
...to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

898
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:49,169
He was already
dangerously disturbed.

899
01:35:49,211 --> 01:35:52,046
Had been ever since his father died.

900
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:55,884
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman...

901
01:35:55,968 --> 01:36:00,889
...and for years they lived as if
there was no one else in the world.

902
01:36:00,973 --> 01:36:06,146
Then she found a man, and it seemed to
Norman that she threw him over for this man.

903
01:36:06,187 --> 01:36:09,858
That pushed him over the thin line,
and he killed them both.

904
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:15,031
So, he had to erase the crime,
at least in his mind.

905
01:36:15,072 --> 01:36:19,452
He stole her corpse,
and a weighted coffin was buried.

906
01:36:19,535 --> 01:36:22,704
He hid the body in the fruit cellar
and treated it...

907
01:36:22,746 --> 01:36:27,376
...to keep it
as well as it would keep.

908
01:36:27,418 --> 01:36:32,131
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.

909
01:36:32,214 --> 01:36:36,094
So, he began to think
and speak for her.

910
01:36:36,178 --> 01:36:39,056
At times, he could be
both personalities...

911
01:36:39,097 --> 01:36:41,058
...carry on conversations.

912
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:44,729
At other times,
the mother-half took over completely.

913
01:36:44,771 --> 01:36:49,567
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother. "

914
01:36:49,609 --> 01:36:51,986
When he met your sister...

915
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:55,990
...he was touched by her
and aroused by her.

916
01:36:56,074 --> 01:37:00,661
He wanted her.
This set off his jealous mother.

917
01:37:00,745 --> 01:37:04,083
And "Mother" killed the girl.

918
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:07,920
Whenever reality came too close...

919
01:37:08,003 --> 01:37:12,758
...when danger or desire
threatened that illusion...

920
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:16,554
...he'd dress up...
even to a cheap wig he'd bought...

921
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:20,307
...and he'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair...

922
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:23,186
...speak in her voice.

923
01:37:23,269 --> 01:37:26,690
He tried to be his mother.

924
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:31,611
And now he is.

925
01:37:31,695 --> 01:37:35,616
- And the $400,000? Who got that?
- The swamp.

926
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:39,036
These were crimes of passion,
not profit.

927
01:37:40,413 --> 01:37:44,668
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

928
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:46,795
- Sure.
- All right.

929
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:04,272
Thank you.

930
01:38:12,823 --> 01:38:18,494
It's sad when a mother has to speak
the words that condemn her own son...

931
01:38:18,578 --> 01:38:22,958
...but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

932
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,960
They'll put him away now...

933
01:38:25,002 --> 01:38:27,963
...as I should have years ago.

934
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:31,176
He was always bad.

935
01:38:31,259 --> 01:38:36,848
And in the end, he intended to tell them
that I killed those girls and that man.

936
01:38:36,931 --> 01:38:40,478
As if I could do anything
except just sit and stare...

937
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:42,855
...like one of his stuffed birds.

938
01:38:42,938 --> 01:38:48,361
Well, they know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

939
01:38:48,444 --> 01:38:50,947
I'll just sit here
and be quiet...

940
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:55,202
...just in case they do suspect me.

941
01:38:55,285 --> 01:38:59,081
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

942
01:38:59,164 --> 01:39:01,834
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

943
01:39:01,876 --> 01:39:03,920
I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.

944
01:39:04,003 --> 01:39:06,296
- I hope they are watching.
- They're probably watching me.

945
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:09,300
- They'll see.
- Well, I'll let 'em.

946
01:39:09,384 --> 01:39:11,427
They'll see, and they'll know.

947
01:39:11,511 --> 01:39:16,640
And they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly. "

948
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:35,703
Yeah, you're gonna
get stuck on somethin'.

949
01:39:35,744 --> 01:39:37,705
Keep pullin'.

950
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:38,020
- Don't go in there.
- Guys, it's done!

951
01:40:38,103 --> 01:40:40,522
It's all clear here.
Comin' through!

952
01:40:40,606 --> 01:40:42,858
All right, comin' through.
