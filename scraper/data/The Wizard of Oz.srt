-And Scarecrow's brain?

Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

Back where I come from,
we have universities...

...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1292

They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1294
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:59,309
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

1295
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:03,313
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1299

The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1300
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,413
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1301

-How can I thank you enough?
-Well, you can't.

1304

As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

1305
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:35,011
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1306

You're confusing courage with wisdom.

And they have no more courage
than you have.

But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

...but this could never be like Kansas.

1398
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,866
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1399
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:51,077
Oh, Scarecrow,
what am l going to do?

1400
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,080
Look!

1401
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:56,374
Here's someone who can help you!

1402
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:34,162
-Will you help me? Can you help me?
-You don't need help any longer.

1403
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:37,165
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1404
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:40,251
-l have?
-Then why didn't you tell her before?

1405
01:36:40,419 --> 01:36:44,422
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1406
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:47,008
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1407
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,843
Well....

1408
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,096
I think that it...

1409
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:56,267
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1410
01:36:56,435 --> 01:37:01,105
And it's that if l ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1411
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:04,692
...l won't look any further
than my own back yard...

1412
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,195
...because if it isn't there...

1413
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:10,448
...l never really lost it to begin with.

1414
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:11,741
Is that right?

1415
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,701
That's all it is.

1416
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:17,038
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.

1417
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:20,959
-l should've felt it in my heart.
-She had to find it out for herself.

1418
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:24,629
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

1419
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,340
-Toto too?
-Toto too.

1420
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,592
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1421
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,263
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!

1422
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,099
Oh, it's....

1423
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,727
It's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

1424
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:42,272
I love you all too.

1425
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,609
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1426
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:49,028
Oh, don't cry.

1427
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,240
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1428
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,077
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1429
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,456
-Goodbye.
-Now l know l've got a heart...

1430
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,709
...because it's breaking.

1431
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:09,382
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...

1432
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,303
...but l'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1433
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,972
...before you found your courage.

1434
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:20,226
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1435
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:28,026
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1436
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:36,075
-Are you ready now?
-Yes.

1437
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,954
Say goodbye, Toto.

1438
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:46,210
-Yes, I'm ready now.
-Then close your eyes...

1439
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:49,380
...and tap your heels
together three times...

1440
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,593
...and think to yourself:

1441
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,763
"There's no place like home.

1442
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:00,266
There's no place like home."

1443
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:03,978
There's no place like home.

1444
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:07,649
There's no place like home.

1445
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,776
There's no place like home.

1446
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:13,029
There's no place like home.

1447
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,824
There's no place like home.

1448
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:22,956
There's no place like home.

1449
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,917
There's no place like home.

1450
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,755
AUNTIE EM: Wake up, honey.
-There's no place like home.

1451
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,342
There's no place like home.

1452
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:38,096
There's no....

1453
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,394
Dorothy, dear. lt's Aunt Em, darling.

1454
01:39:44,561 --> 01:39:46,646
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1455
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,816
-Yes, darling.
PROFESSOR: Hello there! Anybody home?

1456
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,653
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big--

1457
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,615
-Well, she seems all right now.
-She got quite a bump on the head.

1458
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:00,326
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1459
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,204
But l did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1460
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,373
And l tried to get back for days!

1461
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,500
There, there, lie quiet now.

1462
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,753
-You just had a bad dream.
-Sure.

1463
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,505
Remember me...

1464
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,924
...your old pal, Hunk?

1465
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,719
And me, Hickory?

1466
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,721
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1467
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:23,641
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

1468
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:26,477
And you and you and you...

1469
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:28,563
...and you were there.

1470
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,691
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

1471
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,860
AUNTIE EM: We dream lots
of silly things when we--

1472
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:38,031
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1473
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,284
And l remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1474
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,411
...but most of it was beautiful.

1475
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:47,457
But just the same, all l kept saying
to everybody was, "l want to go home!"

1476
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:49,709
And they sent me home.

1477
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,377
[ALL CHUCKLING]

1478
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,379
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1479
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,631
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1480
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:58,301
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1481
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,304
Home! And this is my room...

1482
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,056
...and you're all here.

1483
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,434
And l'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1484
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,561
...because I love you all.

1485
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:12,190
And oh, Auntie Em...

1486
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:15,401
...there's no place like home!
