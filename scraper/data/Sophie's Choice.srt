It was 1947,

3
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,949
two years after the war,
when I began my journey

the "Sodom of the north,"

I had barely saved enough
money to write my novel,

10
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,554
for I wanted beyond hope
or dreaming to be a writer.

11
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,641
But my spirit had remained landlocked,

12
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,478
unacquainted with love
and a stranger to death.

to find in Manhattan.

15
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,448

00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,027
Now, this one. Look at this.
God's gift!

166
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,112
Give me a kiss.

167
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,614
One kiss.
Please.

168
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,867
All right, one kiss.
That's all you deserve.

169
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,035
One more.
I need one more.

170
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,078
No.

171
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,038
I have to have one more.
Nathan...

172
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,290
Can't keep my hands off of you.

173
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,793

No, Nathan Landau!

174
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,968
NATHAN:
What do you think of that, Stingo, hmm?

175
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,631
Here I am, a nice Jewish boy,

176
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,300

177
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,803
I fall crazy in love
with a Polish shiksa.

178
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,088
STINGO: What is that?
What is a "shiksa"?

179
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:54,409
A shiksa is a goy girl.
A lady of the Gentile persuasion.

180
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,479
She's a... Oh!

181
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,316
All right.
I just assumed that she was...

182
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,902
She was Jewish?
Yeah.

183
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,153
(SOPHIE LAUGHING)
Jewish?

184
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,824
No, no, no.
No, our Sophie is Catholic.

185
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,288
Yeah. Well, it's okay,
but I'm not anymore Catholic, so.

186
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, Catholic-ish.

187
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,168
When I first met this one here,

188
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,255
she was a rag and a bone
and a hank of hair.

189
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,340
And that was a whole
year-and-a-half

190
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,260
after the Russians had
liberated the camp she was in.

191
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,514
Yeah, it looked like something
that scares the birds.

192
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,851
What is that?
Scarecrow.

193
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,645
(CLEARS THROAT)
I had "scurbut."

194
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,398
No, no, no!
She means scurvy.

195
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,401
And typhus and anemia and scarlet fever.

196
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
It was a fucking miracle that she
emerged from that camp alive.

197
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,280
Right.

198
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,034
I mean, (SCOFFS)
I thought that I had leukemia.

199
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,455
I thought I was dying.

200
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,834
But it was Nathan that see
that it was only anemia.

201
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,502
Are you a doctor?

202
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,587
NATHAN:
No, no.

203

That's my brother's domain.

204
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,673
But I'm a biologist.

205
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,758
Yeah!

206
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,385
I graduated in science from Harvard.
Harvard.

207
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,721
And he...
(STUTTERING)

208
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,267
MA in Developmental and Cellular Biology.

209
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,645
I do research now.

210
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,687
He works at Pfizer.

211
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,815
Pfizer, it's a big pharmaceutical
house here in Brooklyn.

212
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,069
Anyway, I took her to this
friend of my brother's,

213
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,488
a doctor who teaches up
at Columbia Presbyterian.

214
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,697
Yeah.

215
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,866
He confirmed my diagnosis.

216
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,327
And we put the little sweetie here

217
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,913
on massive doses of ferrous sulfate

218
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,416
and she began to bloom like a rose.

219
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,213
A rose.

220
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,050
A beautiful fucking rose.

00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,097
You're something.

222
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,725
Thank you for making me
to bloom like a rose.

223
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,029
Not "to bloom,"
just "bloom."

224
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,198
She's so good.
It's about time she was perfect.

225
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,118
(SCOFFS) "To bloom." So what?
I mean, this is a ridiculous language!

226
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,911
There's too many words!

227
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:22,207
The word for "velocity," okay,
there's "fast, quick, rapid,"

228
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,126
and they all mean the same thing.

229
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,377
Swift, speedy.

In French, it's so easy.
You say vite.

237
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,855
Or in Polish, szybko,
and in Russian, bystro.

238
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,525
It's only in the English
it's so complicated!

How many languages do you know?

240
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,738
Well, my father was a
linguist, so I mean, I...

241
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,491
He teach me German, French,
Russian, Hungarian,

243

I bet your father was
a very interesting man.

246
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,301
Yeah, my father was

247
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
a civilized man.

248
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,187
That's the word, yeah?
"Civilized"?

249
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,439
NATHAN: Very good word.
Yeah?

250

living in a non-civilized time.

I no longer play.

I remember, I'd lay in bed

264
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,404
and I'd hear my mother
downstairs playing the piano,

265

and the sound of my father's typewriter.

wonderful father and mother.

"Don't you see, Sophie?
We are dying."

flooding across the spotless carpet,

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,382
out the door down Pierrepont Street,

00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,470
across all the twilit carnal
reaches of Brooklyn.

Leslie.

494
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,476
A weekend alone with Leslie.

No.

He has the answers.
He knows so much about fucking.

498
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,075
He says...

499
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,495
He says that when you fuck,
you go to the Dark Gods.

500

Uh-huh.
Stingo, I really mean it.

501
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,461
To fuck is to go to the Dark Gods.

Let's go to the Dark Gods!

to ask, what is going on?

00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,301

Before I reach this
plateau of vocalization,

511
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,900
I could never have said
any of those words.

Those Anglo-Saxon four letter words
that everybody should be able to say.

513
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,285
Now I'm completely able to vocalize.

Mmm.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

590
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,736
I had a presentiment.

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,782
I had many fears and I...

592
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,453
I run out of the church
and I go to the university,

593
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,497
and I see that the gate is locked.

594
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,418
And there were many, many Germans there.

595

(SIGHS)

596
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,548
And I saw the professors.
They was loading them into the truck.

597
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,719
And this one part of
canvas has moved away.

598
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,974
And I see my father's face and the
face of my husband behind him.

599
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,977
And...

600
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,981
I looked.

601
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,902
But the German, he pulled that away

602
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,280
and I never saw those faces again.

603
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,157
They took them to Sachsenhausen, you know.

604
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,494
That's a German work camp, but
they shot them the next day.

605
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,787

00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,928
(STUTTERING)
Tuberculosis and...

610
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,307
Oh, she is very sick, you know.

611
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,894
She started to die of that,
and I can't do anything.

612
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,441
But I think if I could get miêso...

613
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,986
If I could get that meat for my
mother, I would make her strong.

614
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,280
So I go to the country,

615
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,868
and the peasants there,
they're selling ham.

616
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,289
And I go with that black market money,

617
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,750
I buy that and I bring it back.

618
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,435
But, you know, this is forbidden because

619
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,421
all the meat goes to
the Germans, you know.

620
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,131
If you get caught...

621
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:09,553
So I hid the ham under
my skirt on the train.

622
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,556
I'm pretending that
I'm pregnant, you know.

623
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,599
Ah!
I was so afraid!

624
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,643
I was shaking.

625
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,020
And then that German,

626
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,901
who was in the front of
the train, and he saw me.

627
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,904
And I'm sitting there
and he came up to me

628
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,824
and he take under my skirt that ham.

629
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,201
(SCOFFS)

630
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,417
So they sent me to Auschwitz.

631
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:46,256
You were sent to Auschwitz
because you stole a ham?

632
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,135
No. I was sent to Auschwitz
because they saw that I was afraid.

633
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,265
Oh, yeah.

634
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,601
You know what that means?

635
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,727
Yeah.

636
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,439
You tried to commit suicide in Auschwitz?

637
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,234
No, it was after that.

638
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,278
After that, I was in...

639
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,866
After liberation.

640
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,326
After you were safe?

641
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,786
Yes, safe, yeah.

642
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,626
I was safe. I was in Sweden.
I was in that refugee camp.

643
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,339
I mean, that was good.
They try to help you, you know.

644
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,799
They try to...

645
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,385
They try, but...

646
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,517
I knew that

647
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:46,775
Christ had turned his face away from me.

648
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,655
And that only a Jesus
who no longer cared for me

649
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,908
could kill those people that I love,

651
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,959
Oh, God.
So I went to that church.

652
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,088
And I took the glass, I knelt down

653
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:12,384
and I cut my wrist.

654
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,428

I'm working night duty at
Brooklyn Hospital this week.

667
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,751
My patient is this old lady
who's meaner than my mother,

Well, good night, Astrid.
Have a good sleep.

That was Astrid, you know.

00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,344
Maybe I'll leave the door open.

672
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,722
In case he comes, we could hear him.

673
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,348
So you want another drink?

674
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,894
Your bottle is empty.
Well...

675

Hmm.

keeps another bottle.

if we just call him at the lab.

680
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,210
I can't do that.

681
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,964
I mean, he doesn't like for me to call him.
You know, at work.

682
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,592
So, anyway.

683
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,054
I did it an hour ago.

684
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,932
And there was no answer, so.

685
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,677
I'm sure the switchboard's just shut off.

686
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:28,978
Yes, I think that's right.
I'm sure that...

687
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,397
You know, sometimes when
he can't sleep at night,

688
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,901
he goes and he walks all over the city.

689
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,488
Yeah, he goes into
all these neighborhoods.

690
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,534
I mean, I don't know where he
goes, but once he came back,

691
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:48,414
he had a black eye and his
jaw was all swollen there.

692
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,251
Yeah, I thought it was broken.

693
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,257
You know, he could be hurt.

694
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,553
I don't know where he is, but I think
we should call the police right now.

695
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,472
No, look, I think we
ought to wait two hours.

696
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,225
You know, just wait till somebody
is on the switchboard there.

697
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,685
We'll just call him then.

698
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,689
He's working late. He probably just
got tired and fell asleep there.

699
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:16,442
Yeah.
He's probably asleep there.

Look at this.
The Nazi Primer.

703
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,252
He must have everything ever written
about the Nazis in those years.

704
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,132
Yes, he is obsessed with the Nazis
that are escaping justice. (SIGHS)

705
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,802
Do you suppose all this
started after he met you?

706
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,890
Look, I know I shouldn't
tell him about that place,

707
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,766
but what could I do?

708
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,769
I know it's my fault that he...
Look, I can understand.

709
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,980
After all, he is a Jew.

710
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,693
Yes, he is a Jew, but don't you
think that I'm angry, too?

711
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:03,072
That these men, these terrible
Nazis live, and my father...

712
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,326
Such a good man who tries
to help Jews is killed.

I was stupid. (CHUCKLING)

725
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,705

to take the chance of waking you up.

don't you come up for a drink?"

736

Because I was worried and he
was a very good friend to me.

a lot to teach me there.

01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,284
Did he line up your vertebrae
in a nice neat line

969
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,577
while he was humping you?

970
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,955
I bet he does quite a number with that
fast chiropractor's dick of his, huh?

971
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,761
No. Wait! Nathan!
Come on, you can tell me.

972
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,548
How do you know he took her home?
What have you been doing?

973
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,061
You were following her all afternoon?

974
01:08:53,145 --> 01:08:53,645
Stingo...

975
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,648
What if you find out
why Kats took her home?

976
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,043
I think you're going to feel like a fool.

977
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,469
Just find out why he took her home.

978
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,054
Please, don't!

Too bad our celebration will be of more
mundane stripe than I had intended.

981
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,651
Stingo, I think that you should go...

982
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,375
I'm not going to leave
you alone with him.

983
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,812
You don't understand, you're
making it worse by being here.

984
01:09:19,897 --> 01:09:21,739
No!
He's not going to get away with this shit!

985
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,866
You don't understand him.

986
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,526
Let's just cut out all the ugly shit!

987
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:26,845
Yeah, pour this. Let's celebrate.
You know what?

988
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,622
We're here to toast you.

989
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,874
But what are we doing here?
What are we here to toast?

990
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,842
You're right. You're right.
I'm terribly sorry.

991
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:33,626
That's all right.

992
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,419
I don't know what's come over me.

993
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,466
Here is to my best friend

994
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,636
and my best girl.
There we go.

995
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,722
Here, yeah.
Look what I got you, anyway.

996
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,771
I had the wrapping, but...

997
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,277
It's beautiful.
That's really beautiful.

998
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,361
Do you like it?

999
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,947
I like it?
Like it? I love it.

1000
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,117
Yes.
It's just like Stingo's.

1001
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,202
It is?

1002
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,746
Oh, yeah.

1003
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,373
It has an engraving.

1004

It's beautiful.

This toast is in honor

1006

from you two creeps.

1007

and you, the dreary dregs of Dixie.

1010
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,153
You've not fooled me, young Stingo.

1011
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,325
Since you so graciously allowed me
to read your magnum Southern opus,

Knock it off, Nathan.

1015
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,211
However, look on it optimistically.

I want to ask you one question that's
been burning in my mind for so long.

1021
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,019
Yeah, well, maybe you can
explain something to me.

Oh, the writer!
Sophie's very proud of you.

1071
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,289
Yeah.
Listen, I'm trying to track her down.

But don't you live in the same house?

Mmm-hmm.
She moved out last night.

1074
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,753
Moved out?

1075
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,757
When she called in this
morning, she wasn't well.

1076
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,258
I was worried about her.
She's such a darling girl.

1077
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,844
Listen, do you have any
idea how I can find her?

1078

Um, I think that's over.

1080
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,935
Maybe she went to stay with a friend.

1081
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,688
I don't know any friends of hers.

1082
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:08,777
There was this Polish girl who worked
for a professor at Brooklyn College.

1083
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,072
I remember her name.
It was Sonja Wajinska.

1084
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:16,201
Does a woman named
Sonja Wajinska work here?

1085
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:19,830
No, I am sorry.
She went back to Poland six months ago.

give you her address.

hers, Sophie Zawistowska, do you?

Yes.

1090
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,882
She came here once to visit Sonja,

1091
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,176
but she did not come back again.

1092

She is the daughter

I heard him lecture once.
That was enough.

I know that he was very
outspoken about the Nazis.

1097
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,284
He was crazy about the Nazis.

1098
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,371
I think because they hated
Jews as much as he did.

1099
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,207
The Nazis killed him.

1100

They came one day and made a
clean sweep of all academics.

01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,341
And they didn't stop to check
their political convictions.

A few weeks before, I had
received a letter from my father.

1116
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,527
He had inherited a small farm,

1117
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,821
and knowing I was running out of money,

1118
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:20,033
proposed that I come back
South and live on it.

1119
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,119
I could not bear to stay in Brooklyn.

Oh! He has a job at Pfizer
in the company library.

1601
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,231
An undemanding sinecure I got for him

1602
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:13,150
where he can do a lot of reading
without bothering anyone,

1603
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:15,027
and occasionally
he does a little research

1604

for one of the legitimate
biologists on the staff.

I'm not sure Nathan would forgive
me if he knew that I told you.

01:57:22,577 --> 01:57:26,163
He made me swear never to tell Sophie.
She knows nothing.

was born the perfect child.

He excelled in everything.

1609

Even Nathan's teachers would speculate
on what Nathan would achieve.

See, he was the kind of child

1612

When he was 10,

we were told that the child genius
was a paranoid schizophrenic.

1614
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:59,155
From then on, the only
schools he attended were

Good morning, Mr. Stingo.

Come, darling.

This was Nathan's idea to surprise
you with a Southern evening.

1641
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:55,104
Your book has really whet my
appetite to know about the South.

been discussing the possibility

of taking a tour of your
beloved Dixie in October.

Yeah.

Sure.

make it a wedding trip

put that book away for
a while to make money,

1756
02:08:20,026 --> 02:08:23,737

to see the Washington sights.

you down to that farm

1768
02:08:57,271 --> 02:08:59,064
we can drive over to Richmond,

1769
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:02,401
get a good phonograph,
maybe buy some records.

1770
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:07,614
What do you mean, "Get settled in there"?

1771
02:09:08,699 --> 02:09:12,702
Well, I love you very much, Sophie.

1772
02:09:15,206 --> 02:09:19,084
And I want to marry you.

1773

I want you to live down
there on that farm with me.

I want you to help me

02:09:30,638 --> 02:09:33,598
and I want you to help me raise a family

1776

02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:36,536
Well, then, yes, okay.
We could go down there. Sure.

1787
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:40,457
We could live there
for a while and then...

1914
02:27:07,402 --> 02:27:09,778
When I could finally see again,

1915
02:27:10,655 --> 02:27:15,242
I saw the first rays of daylight
reflected in the murky river.

1916
02:27:17,537 --> 02:27:19,830
This was not judgment day.

1917
02:27:20,582 --> 02:27:22,249
Only morning.

1918
02:27:23,376 --> 02:27:27,463
Morning...
