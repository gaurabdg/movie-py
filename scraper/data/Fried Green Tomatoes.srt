00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,431
<i>Good.

5
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,941
<i>I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

6
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,240
<i>I need to get up there and see her,</i>

7

What?

13
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,318
The train.

14
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,261
No, I didn't hear no train.

15
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,364
Oh, nothin', I guess.

16
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,838
Where's "Whistle Stop" on
the map? I can't find it.

17
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,774
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

18
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,838
God, you got a negative sense of direction, hon.

I'm sorry.

Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

21
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:20,115
I know she's been looking forward

better if you wait out here for me.

29
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,613
I'll get all this stuff.
Well, if you think it's best.

30
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,990
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

31
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,222
Have a nice day, Aunt Vesta.

32
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,231
<i>[Ed]</i>
<i>Don't you pitch a fit like that!</i>

33
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,906
Did you know they took my gallbladder out?

34
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,475
No, I didn't.

35
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,213
<i>Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in a jar.</i>

36
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:26,088
I guess that's where they keep 'em.

37
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,127
I guess.

38
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,424
When I was in the hospital,

39
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,455
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

40
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,128
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

41
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,502
82 year old widow, imagine that.

42
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,701
Actually, everybody calls me Ninny.

43
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,006
'Course I'm just visitin' here.

44
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,346
Did you ever have one of them Fleet enemas?

45
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,351
Um, well?

46
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,478
No.

47
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,786
You'd remember it.

48
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,521
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

49
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,790
You ever been to Whistle Stop?

50
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,265
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

51
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:13,203
<i>She's lived down the street
from me for 30 years or more.</i>

52
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,263
After her son died,

53
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,936
her daughter-in-law had a fit for
her to come live at the nursing home.

54
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,310
They asked me to come and be her roommate.

55
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,614
<i>Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going
home just soon as she gets settled in good.</i>

56
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,356
Does the name "Idgie Threadgoode" ring a bell?

57
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,952
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

58
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,826
You'd remember her.

59
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,800
You see, I was practically
adopted by the Threadgoode family.

60
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,201
I married her brother,
Cleo. Oh, uh-huh.

61
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:50,038
<i>Idgie and her friend, Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

62
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,043
<i>Oh.</i>

63
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,807
Idgie was a character, all right.

64
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,214
<i>But how anybody
could've thought...</i>

65
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,311
<i>she murdered that man
is beyond me.</i>

66
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,356
I beg your pardon?

67
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,985
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

68
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,688
Oh, now, let's see.

69
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,221
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

70
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,259
<i>[Ninny]</i>
<i>That same rainy, summer day...</i>

71
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:23,274
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for
the murder of the owner of that truck,</i>

72
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,311
<i>Frank Bennett.</i>

73
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,048
I guess, to understand Idgie,

74
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,814
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

75
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:39,824
<i>Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

76
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,994
<i>I 'member the day we was all
gettin'ready for Leona's weddin'.</i>

77
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,033
<i>The war had just ended,</i>

78
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,432
<i>the Great one,

79
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,167
<i>And another one was about to
begin in the Threadgoode house.</i>

80
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,675
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

81
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,180
<i>Buddy, get dressed, honey. Mama?</i>

82
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,216
Leona, what is it?

83
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,148
Idgie's upstairs in her room...

84
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,187
and says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

85
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,381
She is gonna ruin my weddin'! Shh.

86
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,254
Leona, you're gonna be the most beautiful bride.

87
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,591
Of course she is, Papa.

88
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,598
Your papa has spent every last
nickel he has just to make you happy.

89
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,466
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

90
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,631
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

91
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,232
This is your mama!

92
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,582
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

93
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,278
Buddy, fetch her. She'll listen
to you. Come on down, little bit.

94
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,913
<i>[Buddy]</i>
<i>There's no firin' squad waitin' for you.</i>

<i>[Idgie] Take it back!
Take it back! Idgie, hey!</i>

105
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,914

106
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,356
<i>Idgie, get up.
Take it back!</i>

107

113
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,240

<i>[Buddy]</i>
<i>Looks like you got yourself up a tree, little bit.</i>

115
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,187
[Idgie]
I'm sick of people makin' fun of me.

116
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,789
So you're gonna stay up here all day long.

117
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,063
Yep.
The hell with them.

118
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:08,072
Who wants to wear that stupid ol' dress anyway?

119
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,507
<i>I ever tell you about
the oysters? Oysters?</i>

120
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,511
I tell you about the oysters? No.

121
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,243
<i>[Buddy] Think about the millions
of oysters lyin'around the ocean.</i>

122
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,649
Then one day...

123
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,518
God comes along and sees one and he says,

124
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,490
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

125
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,754
You know what he does?

126
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,991
He puts a little piece of sand in it.

127
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:36,296
Guess what it can do that
the others can't. What?

128
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,668
It can make a beautiful pearl.

129
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,900
What if God made a mistake?

130
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:47,071
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

131
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,910
I mean, he made sure we got together.

132
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,973
He made sure you got the best looking,

133

who's gonna beat you to the
chocolate cake. You will not.

135
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,123
Got you out of the tree, didn't I?

136
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,127
Did not!

00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:08,716
Where were we? Ruth had just
gotten married to Frank Bennett?

623
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,118
Wasn't that the man Idgie
was arrested for murderin'?

624
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,385
That's right.

625
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:20,021
After Ruth left, Idgie
went back to her old ways,

626
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:24,625
<i>[Ninny] Hangin'out with Grady
and the boys at the river club.</i>

627
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:30,572
<i>But after a few years,
temptation got the better of her.</i>

628
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:37,311
I don't wanna wake you, Miss Idgie,
but it's an all-day drive to Valdosta.

629
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,407
Your mama said if you're goin', she
wants you to take this pie to Miss Ruth.

630
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:45,421
How does she know where
I'm going? I told her.

631
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,925
Don't you go stirrin' up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

632
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,291
Yes, ma'am.
Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

633
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,330
You can stay in my house as long as you want,

634
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,093
but don't treat me like you treat your mama.

635
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,566
Grandma!
Yes, ma'am.

636
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,289

637
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,697
Hi there.

638
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,667
Yes?
Uh, is Ruth at home?

639
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,862
Who's callin'?

640
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,237
You just tell her it's the
bee charmer from Alabama.

641
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,277
Ruth,

642
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,145
there's some bee person here to see you.

Hi.</i>

644

You got a real nice home,
real nice things and all.

645
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,460
Mm-hmm,
thank you.

646
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,998
Mama said to give you this pie.

647
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,840
So...

648
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:21,908
Idgie Threadgoode, how are ya?

649
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:26,581
You look so...
so grown up.

650
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:31,219
[Chuckle]
All the guys must be wild about you.

651
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:35,061
Tell me, do you have a fella yet?

652
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,569
A... couple.

653
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,002
I haven't decided on any.

654
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,006
Grady's the most persistent, but...

655
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,975
Grady Kilgore? Don't say it so loud.

656

What happened to you?
Nothin'.

659

<i>[Frank] Who's down there?</i>

661
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,786
You'd better leave now. Did he hit you?

662
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,557
Did he beat you? Somebody's
got to talk to him. Idgie.

663
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,757
You're not gonna do
anything. I'm gonna kill him.

664
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,891
I'm gonna have a conversation with him about...

You're not gonna do anything.
...pickin' on somebody his own size.

You're not gonna do anything, understand?

667
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,535
If you care about me, if you really do,

668
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,511
you'll turn around and leave
this minute. You understand?

<i>[Footsteps]</i>

670
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,189
Well, what'd she want?

00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,529
Nothin'.

<i>[Laughing]</i>

673
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:58,940

she knows what's best for her.

674
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,508
Mmm, I'm not so sure about that.

Idgie, will you dance with me? No.

678
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,823
Come on.
It's only a dance.

679
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,728
Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
Get your butt off the floor.

680
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:24,035
Will you dance with me?

681
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:31,009
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

682
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,244
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

You're just a goofy girl, Idgie, a goofy girl.

Who're you callin'
a goof? Ow-ow-ow!

You get the sweats and your
hearts starts a-poundin'?

- Simple, honey.

You need some hormones. Hmm?

780
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,285
Maybe some Stresstabs number 4 for good measure.

- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

782

You get yourself some hormones.

783

I'll bet you'll be great with cosmetics.

786
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,406
I know how you feel.

787
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,918
I was about your age when I had my child.

788
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,476
Then I went through the change of life.

789
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:03,185
I didn't know you had
a child. Yes, I did.

790
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,228
Albert.

791
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:10,892
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him.

792
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:15,063
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five,

793
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,107
and I should just put him in an institution...

794
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:22,838
because the burden of raisin' a
child like that would be too great.

795
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:28,882
Well, I thought about Ruth.

796
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,785
She always said...

797
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,292
there was a separate God for children.

798
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:41,262
So I smiled at him and I asked for the baby.

799
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:46,030
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

800
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,332
could ever be a burden?

801
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:52,705
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

802
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,802
the Lord's greatest gift.

803
00:56:55,879 --> 00:57:00,441
I don't believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth.

804
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:03,486
I had him with me till he was 30.

805
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,819
Then he went to sleep and didn't wake up.

806
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,955
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

And I remembered...

1081

thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

And I remembered...

1084
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:23,925
thankin' the Lord for each day my mother lived,

1085
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,292
even when she was spittin' up blood...

1086
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:32,231

01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,174
What's your hurry?

1232
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:48,477
And what is so important?

1233
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:50,779
What's that?

1234
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:54,185
<i>[Grady]</i>
<i>Somebody found Frank Bennett's truck in the river.</i>

1235
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:57,418
What's that got to do with me?

1236
01:29:57,492 --> 01:30:01,451
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1237
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,430
You're in my custody until tomorrow.

1238
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:07,195
I'm supposed to take you to
Georgia first thing in the morning.

1239
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,465
<i>Unless, of course...</i>

1240
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:14,269
Well, some people have been known to pack up...

1241
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:18,745
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1242
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,041
<i>[Idgie]
What about Big George?</i>

1243
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:25,847
Well, the way I figure it,

1244
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,151
they'd be satisfied if they had him.

1245
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,282
Idgie, this is serious.

1246
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,953
We're talkin' murder of a white man.

1247
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:36,258
Someone's gonna have to pay.

1248
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:39,163
Nobody wants to hang a woman.

1249
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,692
No deal.

1250
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,364
Idgie, I know how you feel about Big George.

1251
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,567
Hell, we all do.

1252
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,805
But these just the facts of life.

1253
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,511
I can't do that.

1254
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,347
Take me to jail if you have to.

1255
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,910
Well, that's what I thought you'd say...

1256
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,388
'cause you're absolutely, unconditionally,

1257
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,952
<i>positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.</i>

1258
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:14,496
<i>[Ninny] Idgie and Big George went
to the county jail in Valdosta...</i>

1259
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:18,369
<i>to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.</i>

1260
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,566
<i>They didn't have
to wait too long.</i>

1261
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,042
Did you know Frank Bennett? No, sir.

1262
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,511
You mean, you never met the man...

1263
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:31,109
<i>whose wife, Ruth, is your
business partner? That's right.</i>

1264
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:34,018
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1265
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:37,785
in front of his hired man in June of 1932?

1266
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:42,887
<i>The same Frank Bennett you did not
know. Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

1267
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:46,195
<i>I thought you wanted to know if we'd
ever met... and the answer is no.</i>

1268
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,827
<i>Um, I threatened to kill him,</i>

1269
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:53,067
<i>but we were never, what you
might say, properly introduced.</i>

1270
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:57,133
Is it not true that in September
of 1932 you came to Valdosta...

1271
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:01,045
<i>and took Frank Bennett's wife and
child back to Alabama with you?</i>

1272
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,583
Um... just the wife.
The child came later.

1273
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:07,109
How much later? The usual. Nine months.

1274
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,055
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>I suggest that you bribed...</i>

1275
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:15,426
this poor, weak woman with
promises of liquor and money,

1276
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:19,227
and she lost control of her senses momentarily.

1277
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,292
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1278
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:27,000
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1279
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,801
No, sir.

1280
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:35,144
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1281
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,514
I was at the town hall doing a show.

1282
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:40,679
And after that? I was
at my mother's house.

1283
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:43,280
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1284
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:47,691
<i>Just Big George and myself. What about
your mother? Can she confirm that?</i>

1285
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,026
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1286
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,588
I'm sorry to hear that.

1287
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:56,364
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1288
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,065
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1289
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:02,541
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1290
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,874
You expect these men to take your word for it...

1291
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:07,608
<i>Just because
you say so?</i>

1292
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:12,210
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1293
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,744
<i>[Gasping]</i>
<i>One more outburst like that...</i>

1294
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:19,315
and I'll hold you in contempt
of court. You understand?

1295
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,191
Yes, sir.

1296
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,459
Oh, Lord.
Next witness.

1297
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,504
<i>[Prosecutor]</i>
<i>Did you know that you were pregnant...</i>

1298
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:34,507
<i>at the time
you left Valdosta?</i>

1299
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:36,509
<i>[Ruth]
Yes.</i>

1300
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:40,172
<i>And yet, you tell us
over and over...</i>

1301
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:44,809
<i>that you went with this
woman... willingly?</i>

1302
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:49,083
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1303
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,249
<i>But why?</i>

1304
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:55,523
<i>Did this woman promise you money? No.</i>

1305
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,156
<i>A bigger home?</i>

1306
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:01,326
No. No.

1307
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,030
<i>Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,</i>

1308
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:06,630
<i>why would a respectable
Christian woman...</i>

1309
01:34:06,707 --> 01:34:09,505
<i>go anywhere with this Idgie
Threadgoode... I object.</i>

1310
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,704
<i>Whose reputation
is known far and wide...</i>

1311
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,009
<i>as a notorious liar
and drunkard?</i>

1312
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,379
<i>- Objection!
- Sustained!</i>

1313
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,085
<i>Why did you leave...</i>

1314
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:26,115
<i>with Idgie Threadgoode
that day?</i>

1315
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:30,827
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>Answer the question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

1316
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:34,725
Because she...

1317
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:39,898
She's the best friend I ever had,

1318
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,067
and I love her.

1319
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:45,678
<i>[Prosecutor]</i>
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Bennett. That will be all.</i>

1320
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:48,579
<i>[Defense Attorney]</i>
<i>The defense calls as its last witness...</i>

1321
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:51,379
<i>the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.</i>

1322
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,712
Place your right hand on the Bible, please.

1323
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,987
I brought my own, if you don't mind.

1324
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,121
You swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1325
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,188
I do.

1326
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:11,466
<i>[Defense Attorney]</i>
<i>You have information about the whereabouts...</i>

1327
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:15,134
<i>of Idgie Threadgoode and her
colored man, known as Big George,</i>

1328
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:18,975
on the night of September 30, 1933?

1329
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:21,014
Yes, sir, I do.

1330
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:23,516
<i>It has been
suggested here...</i>

1331
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:27,042
<i>that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.</i>

1332
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:31,353
<i>Can you confirm that?
No, sir. That is a lie.</i>

1333
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:34,155
[Whispering]
Oh, shit.

1334
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:37,459
<i>[Rev. Scroggins]</i>
<i>It has been my habit to write all the dates...</i>

1335
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:40,466
<i>of the activities of
the church in my Bible.</i>

1336
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:45,198
<i>I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...</i>

1337
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:48,298
was the start of our annual revival...

1338
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:51,139
down at the Baptist campground.

1339
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,305
Sister Threadgoode was there...

1340
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:57,407
<i>along with her hired man, George Pullman,</i>

1341
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:01,615
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1342
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,351
<i>for the last ten years.
Objection.</i>

1343
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:08,953
That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've
taken place any time the next couple of days.

1344
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:14,057
<i>Have you ever been to one of
our revivals, sir? Well, no.</i>

1345
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,194
Do you attend church regularly, sir?

1346
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,465
'Course I do.

1347
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:23,067
<i>Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,</i>

1348
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,510
<i>you'd know
they last three days...</i>

1349
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:27,911
and three nights, Your Honor.

1350
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:30,116
<i>[Gavel Pounding]</i>

1351
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:33,153
<i>[Judge]
Approach the bench.</i>

1352
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:37,919
Percy, it don't look like you got a case at all.

1353
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:40,552
In the first place, there's no body.

1354
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:43,893
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1355
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:48,162
But, Your Honor... I'm tellin' you.
What you got is a lot of nothing.

1356
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:51,466
<i>[Judge]</i>
<i>I say Frank Bennett got himself drunk,</i>

1357
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:55,703
<i>drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...</i>

1358
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:58,939
and I don't give a good goddamn!

1359
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,471
What we got here is a case of accidental death.

1360
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,177
Case dismissed.

1361
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,685
Whoo!

1362
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:16,528
See you in church, Sister?

1363
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:19,661
Reverend.

1364
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:24,033
I can't believe he actually swore on a Bible.

1365
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,038
Well, not really.

1366
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,097
If that judge had looked closer,

1367
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:31,235
<i>he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.</i>

1368
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,683
But why did he do it? For the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again...

1369
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:40,584
which I suggested to him might be your penance.

1370
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:43,282
You didn't promise him,
did you? Yes, ma'am, I did.

1371
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,291
And I never break my word.

1372
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,728
If I live 1,000 years, I will never forgive you.

1373
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:53,961
I don't know what's worse, church or jail.

1374
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:08,073
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1375
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,275
Oh, yes, honey.

1376
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:15,015
You'll have me lookin' like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1377
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:19,321
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1378
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:24,059

Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode

this big flock of ducks...

01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:38,621
now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1534
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,758
Can you imagine?

1535
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:42,724
It's all right, honey.

1536
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:48,765
Let her go.

1537
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:53,067
You know, Miss Ruth was a lady.

1538
01:51:53,139 --> 01:51:56,404
And a lady always knows...

1539
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:59,468
when to leave.

1540
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:03,209
[Sigh]

1541
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:09,080
<i>[Rev. Scroggins]</i>
<i>When I think on our departed sister, Ruth Jamison,</i>

1542
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:12,249
<i>I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...</i>

1543
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:14,793
<i>and how his teachings...</i>

1544
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:19,298
<i>[Ninny]</i>
<i>It's funny how strong Ruth affected everyone,</i>

1545
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:22,766
<i>even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

1546
01:52:22,836 --> 01:52:25,498
<i>When he died
a few years back...</i>

1547
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:28,268
<i>he had one possession on him,</i>

1548
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:30,935
<i>a picture of Ruth.</i>

1549
01:52:32,312 --> 01:52:36,408
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

1550
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:39,350
<i>We all were.</i>

1551
01:52:45,325 --> 01:52:47,793
I shouldn't
a-told you this.

1552
01:52:49,729 --> 01:52:53,688
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1553
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:56,292
Death is nothin' to be afraid of!

1554
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:59,429
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'-off place,

1555
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:02,737
<i>and I ain't afraid
one bit.</i>

1556
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:06,506
Oh, Ninny, you're so brave.

1557
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:12,017
Ruth and Idgie were brave, not me.

1558
01:53:12,085 --> 01:53:15,452
I wouldn't be afraid of death if I was you.

1559
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:20,459
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1560
01:53:22,729 --> 01:53:27,666
Oh-oh-oh

1561
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:30,567
Just listen to that rain

1562
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,105
A-rainin' in the north

1563
01:53:33,173 --> 01:53:34,765
A-rainin' in the south

1564
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:38,140
A-rainin' in the east

1565
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:40,372
A-rainin' in the west

1566
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:42,846
Ooh-ooh

1567
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:46,443
Tell me didn't it rain children

1568
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:48,453
<i>Rain all night long</i>

1569
01:53:48,521 --> 01:53:50,682
<i>Didn't it you know it did</i>

1570
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:55,023
<i>I said, o my good Lord didn't it rain</i>

1571
01:53:55,094 --> 01:53:58,530
Hey, it rained 40 days and
40 nights without stoppin'

1572
01:53:58,598 --> 01:54:00,998
Noah got worried
and the rain kept a-droppin'

1573
01:54:01,067 --> 01:54:03,467
He sent out a raven Sent out a dove

1574
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:05,834
The water, good God came down from above

1575
01:54:05,905 --> 01:54:08,169
<i>They tell me my God
went and sent the rain</i>

1576
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:10,675
The women and the children did begin to scream

1577
01:54:10,743 --> 01:54:12,802
They knocked on the windows
and they batted at the doors

1578
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:15,780
While they... Hoo, hoo
Take on more

1579
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,113
<i>Noah said No, no, my friend</i>

1580
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:20,311
<i>God said I can't let you in</i>

1581
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:23,014
Hoo, hoo

1582
01:54:23,089 --> 01:54:25,523
Listen to the rain

1583
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:30,325
Uh-oh
Just listen to the rain

1584
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:32,694
Listen to the rain

1585
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,790
Just listen to the rain Oh, oh

1586
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:37,837
Listen, a-listen to the rain
Oh, oh, listen

1587
01:54:37,904 --> 01:54:40,270
Listen to the rain Yeah, yeah, listen

1588
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,774
Listen to the rain
Uh-oh, listen

1589
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:45,333
<i>Listen to the rain Yeah, yeah, listen</i>

1590
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:49,871
<i>Last chance Listen to the rain now</i>

1591
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:52,543
<i>And then drip, drop drip, drop</i>

1592
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:56,749
Drip, drop drip,
drip, a-drop drip, drop

1593
01:54:57,423 --> 01:54:59,857
<i>Yeah, drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1594
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:02,087
<i>Now, drip, drop</i>

1595
01:55:02,161 --> 01:55:05,961
<i>Drip, drip, a-drop</i>

1596
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:18,667
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1597
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,770
Ah...

1598
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:24,305
Ed, how sweet!

1599
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:26,818
Lilies! My favorite. Yeah.

1600
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:30,014
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1601
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:34,185
What's the occasion?
Oh, honey, I just...

1602
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,229
feel sorry about the past few months.

1603
01:55:37,297 --> 01:55:41,290
I don't know what you're really
up to and what's going on with you,

1604
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:45,770
but I guess I could've been more helpful
with your job and everything, you know.

1605
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:48,871
Well, why are you...

1606
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,911
puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1607
01:55:51,978 --> 01:55:55,106
Well...
I changed my mind.

1608
01:55:55,181 --> 01:55:57,945
I don't mean to seem dense or anything,

1609
01:55:58,017 --> 01:56:02,249
but what's changed?
The air and the light.

1610
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,218
Ed...
Hmm?

1611
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:09,761
You remember how you used to tell me...

1612
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:12,559
you always wanted two women in your house?

1613
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,930
[Laughing]
Oh, God.

1614
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:16,662
Yeah.

1615
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:18,761
Well...

1616
01:56:18,838 --> 01:56:21,773
what if I was the younger of the two?

1617
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:25,368
I don't believe I get your drift.

1618
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:29,973
I want something more than I've
ever wanted anything before.

1619
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:32,813
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1620
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:35,080
to our home.

1621
01:56:35,154 --> 01:56:37,782
I want her to live here with us.

1622
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:40,348
I want to give her the love she's given me.

1623
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:44,590
[Snicker] You're kiddin' me, aren't you?
I'm absolutely serious.

1624
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:49,499
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1625
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,629
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1626
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:55,367
I mean, she's an old woman.

1627
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:58,672
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1628
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:00,440
I will!

1629
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:02,504
I can't leave her in that place.

1630
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:06,484
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1631
01:57:06,552 --> 01:57:09,612
She's family to me.
Now, Evelyn.

1632
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,516
<i>Evelyn?</i>

1633
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:15,458
<i>Honey?</i>

1634
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:17,519
<i>Ah, look...</i>

1635
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:21,829
have you mentioned this harebrained idea to her?

1636
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:24,961
Not yet.
Well, good!

1637
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,506
Then we'll just pretend it never happened.

1638
01:57:27,573 --> 01:57:30,599
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1639
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:34,237
You don't have to do a thing.

1640
01:57:34,313 --> 01:57:36,804
Evelyn...

1641
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:39,351
it's never gonna happen.

1642
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:42,081
So just forget about it.

1643
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:46,453
Don't you ever say "never" to me.

1644
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:58,199
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1645
01:57:58,271 --> 01:58:00,865
and I didn't like what I saw one bit.

1646
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:04,774
You know what I did?
I changed.

1647
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:08,746
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1648
01:58:08,815 --> 01:58:13,309
She needs my love and care,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

1649
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:18,717
If you'll excuse me, I have to go to the gym.

1650
01:58:23,663 --> 01:58:26,689
And if you won't listen to reason...

1651
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:30,395
there's always Towanda.

1652
01:58:45,184 --> 01:58:48,153
Hey, Nin...

1653
01:58:50,823 --> 01:58:53,849
What are you doing?

1654
01:58:53,926 --> 01:58:56,656
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1655
01:58:56,729 --> 01:58:59,823
What are you doing in here?
Where's Mrs. Threadgoode? Who?

1656
01:58:59,899 --> 01:59:02,732
Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman
who lives here. Are you deaf?

1657
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:05,703
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1658
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:09,969
was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1659
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:13,971
Oh, my God!

1660
01:59:14,046 --> 01:59:18,380
Wha... What
are you sayin'?

1661
01:59:18,451 --> 01:59:20,612
<i>She died early
this morning.</i>

1662
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:25,020
<i>They were shorthanded so they asked
me to take all this stuff down.</i>

1663
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:27,582
<i>That's all I know.</i>

1664
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:48,913
Stop that!

1665
01:59:48,981 --> 01:59:51,347
What is the matter with you people?

1666
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:54,352
Can't you wait a goddamn day, for Chrissake?

1667
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,412
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1668
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:01,654
I'm sorry, but they told me to get
this room ready for another patient.

1669
02:00:01,727 --> 02:00:04,924
She may be just another patient to you,

1670
02:00:04,997 --> 02:00:09,093
but she was my friend,
and I loved her. I'm sorry.

1671
02:00:09,168 --> 02:00:11,102
I'm just following orders.

1672
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:14,105
What is going on? Why
didn't you call me?

1673
02:00:14,173 --> 02:00:17,506
You could've called me before
you sent that idiot... I'm sorry.

1674
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:20,239
It never occurred to me that
you would take it this hard.

1675
02:00:20,313 --> 02:00:23,942
I didn't even get to tell
her good-bye. Oh, I know.

1676
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:27,975
These things are difficult, but
she died peacefully in her sleep.

1677
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:31,319
To tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1678
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,416
Happy? Why, yes! This
is what she wanted.

1679
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:36,427
What?
To be dead?

1680
02:00:36,495 --> 02:00:39,020
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1681
02:00:39,098 --> 02:00:41,532
She left in a yellow cab about a half hour ago.

1682
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:44,297
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1683
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:48,636
She said there wasn't no reason for
her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.

1684
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:51,336
Mrs...

1685
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,571
Otis is dead?

1686
02:00:53,646 --> 02:00:57,514
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1687
02:00:57,583 --> 02:00:59,574
Mrs. Otis died!

1688
02:00:59,652 --> 02:01:02,849
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1689
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:06,949
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just...

1690
02:01:07,026 --> 02:01:09,654
Oh, God, I've gotta stop her.

1691
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:52,332
Hey, Evelyn, somebody stole my house.

1692
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:55,306
It was right here when I left.

1693
02:01:55,374 --> 02:02:00,141
Unless... Oh, Evelyn, you
don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

1694
02:02:00,212 --> 02:02:04,410
It was here when I left.
No, honey, you're not crazy.

1695
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:07,247
This is the place.

1696
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,347
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1697
02:02:11,424 --> 02:02:13,551
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1698
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:17,027
Oh, honey, nobody stole it.

1699
02:02:17,096 --> 02:02:20,964
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1700
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:23,160
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1701
02:02:23,235 --> 02:02:26,500
Well, somebody shoulda told me.

1702
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:31,407
I'm old. I'm not a child. I'm sorry.

1703
02:02:31,477 --> 02:02:34,810
My husband Cleo and I lived in this house...

1704
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,371
for more than 40 years.

1705
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:40,851
Now, it's... it's gone.

1706
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:44,481
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1707
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:48,584
is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1708
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:51,129
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1709
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,324
This is my home!

1710
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:55,390
And now it's gone.

1711
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:57,993
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1712
02:02:58,070 --> 02:03:00,163
I...

1713
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,833
I don't quite know what to do.

1714
02:03:02,908 --> 02:03:06,742
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

1715
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:09,178
You can come look after me and Ed.

1716
02:03:09,248 --> 02:03:11,546
Oh, you're sweet,

1717
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:14,415
but I think you're doin' just fine on your own.

1718
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:18,787
Don't you know you'd be like a gift for us?

1719
02:03:18,858 --> 02:03:22,021
You're the reason I get up every morning...

1720
02:03:22,094 --> 02:03:25,427
and that Mary Kay's havin' such a good year...

1721
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:30,060
and I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1722
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:34,163
Well, with a little help from Idgie and Ruth.

1723
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:38,266
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1724
02:03:38,344 --> 02:03:40,744
What does Ed say about all this?

1725
02:03:40,813 --> 02:03:44,647
He'll learn to love it.

1726
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:52,250
Did I ever tell you that Mrs.
Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

1727
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:54,986
No, ma'am.
Yes, she was.

1728
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,928
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey
and me the night Sipsey died.

1729
02:03:58,998 --> 02:04:04,163
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

1730
02:04:04,236 --> 02:04:07,364

No offense taken.

You're a good man,

It's gonna be ready any time now.

1767

can't wait to get me some.

you tell Ruth good-bye.

Not today you don't.
Go on.

1777
02:08:27,332 --> 02:08:30,460
Why, this is about the best barbecue I ever ate!

1778
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:35,462
The secret's in the sauce.

1779

Sipsey?
My God!

1780
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:52,521
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1781
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:58,753
Did Idgie really barbecue Frank
Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?

1782
02:08:58,831 --> 02:09:02,528
Secret's in the sauce, or so I've been told.

1783
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:09,872
Now you know why Idgie had to go on trial.

1784
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:13,571
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1785
02:09:13,645 --> 02:09:16,136
Sipsey or Big George or anyone else of color...

1786
02:09:16,215 --> 02:09:19,673
would've been hangin' from the nearest tree.

1787
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:22,016
To this day, I'm still not sure...

1788
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,647
whether Ruth ever believed...

1789
02:09:24,723 --> 02:09:28,853
that Idgie didn't kill Frank Bennett.

1790

I feel better now.
Good.

1792
