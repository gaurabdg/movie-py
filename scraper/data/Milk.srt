1
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:39,101
This is Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.

2
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:44,933
This is only to be played in the
event of my death by assassination.

3
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,115
During one of
my early campaigns,

4
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:57,089
I began to open speeches with a line
and it became kind of a signature.

5
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,920
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I want to recruit you.</i>

6
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:07,223
If I was speaking to a
slightly hostile audience

7
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,361
or a mostly straight one, I might
break the tension with a joke.

8
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:14,271
I know. I know I'm
not what you expected,

9
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,932
but I left my
high heels at home.

10
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:24,849
I fully realize that a person
who stands for what I stand for,

11
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,384
an activist,
a gay activist,

12
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,248
<i>makes himself the target
for someone who is insecure,</i>

13
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:35,453
<i>terrified, afraid
and disturbed themselves.</i>

14
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:40,056
It's a very real possibility you
see, because in San Francisco,

15
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,933
we have broken a dam of major
prejudice in this country.

16
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,029
<i>...room 200.
I'm in the mayor's office.</i>

17
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,906
<i>We are trying
to ascertain what is happening.</i>

18
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,838
As President of the
Board of Supervisors,

19
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:56,347
it's my duty to
make this announcement.

20
00:03:57,283 --> 00:04:01,117
Both Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk

21
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,385
have been shot and killed.

22
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,488
I wish I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

23
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,500
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay movement.

24
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,534
Hey. Hey.

25
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:29,879
I'm Harvey.

26
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:31,544
Okay, Harvey.

27
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,651
Today's my birthday.

28
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,318
No, hey, actually it is
my birthday. At midnight.

29
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,450
Really?

30
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,990
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

31
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,933
Some people took
me out after work.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,597
Hmm. And that would be at,
let me guess, Ma Bell or AT&T.

33
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,339
The Great American
Insurance Company.

34
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,501
Oh.

35
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,603
I'm part of that corporate
establishment that,

36
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,615
let me guess, you think is the
cause of all the evil in the world,

37
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,241
from Vietnam
to diaper rash.

38
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:06,876
You left out bad breath.

39
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,384
Just kidding.

40
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,587
You're not gonna let me spend my
birthday all by myself, are you?

41
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,665
Listen, Harvey,

42
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,960
you're pretty cute,

43
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,005
but I don't
date guys over 40.

44
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:31,140
Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

45
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:32,976
Why is that?

46
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,740
I'm still 39.

47
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,276
It's only 11:15.

48
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,458
Come on.

49
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,462
What's your name?

50
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,435
I'm Scott.

51
00:05:57,503 --> 00:06:00,438
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Harvey, insurance man.

52
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:41,239
Where are you from?

53
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:43,145
Jackson, Mississippi.

54
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:48,085
This isn't Jackson. You can't
respond to just every strange man

55
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,781
that picks you up
on a subway platform.

56
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
It's too dangerous.

57
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,288
Hmm, now you tell me.

58
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,221
The New York Police
are the toughest.

59
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:57,023
They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

60
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,563
I'll show you all
the cruising spots,

61
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,565
but you have to be very
careful, little Scotty-san.

62
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,999
Are you on
some uppers or something?

63
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:06,401
No. This is
just plain me.

64
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,369
And you're scared
of the cops?

65
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,701
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

66
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:14,678
If they see me,
I could lose my job.

67
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,210
Oh, you're one of those.

68
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:23,247
Well, I think you need to find
a new scene. Some new friends.

69
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,420
I need a change.
I know.

70
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,389
Yeah, you're 40 now.

71
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:32,453
Oh.

72
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,065
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

73
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,132
You keep eating this cake and you're
going to be fat by the time you're 50.

74
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,144
That's if I ever
get to 50. Oh!

75
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,973
Happy birthday, old man.

76
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,511
Why don't we
run away together?

77
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:56,850
Where to?

78
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:12,533
<i>HARVEY/ In the past, and still now,</i>

79
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,938
<i>San Francisco was the place
where everyone wanted to go.</i>

80
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,444
<i>To drop out,
to fall in love.</i>

81
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:27,450
But by 1972, the Haight was boarded
up. Drug filled, crime filled.

82
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,045
The new place
for us refugees

83
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:33,421
<i>was a little Irish Catholic
neighborhood in the Eureka Valley,</i>

84
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,085
<i>six blocks square,</i>

85
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,025
<i>the Castro.</i>

86
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,405
I cashed my last unemployment
check yesterday.

87
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,980
Well, I hope you did
something useful with it.

88
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,380
I bought
an ounce of pot.

89
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,182
Don't
move for a second.

90
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,788
I suppose
I can wait tables.

91
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,319
I don't want you to go anywhere.

92
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,831
I want you
right here with me.

93
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,028
I was thinking
about a little shop.

94
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:51,501
What kind of shop?

95
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,162
Just a little shop
with a little overhead.

96
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,263
Not too much work.

97
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,002
Just like Morris and Minnie
Milk of Woodmere, New York.

98
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,042
Did you see the little
place downstairs for rent?

99
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,511
Yeah.

100
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:03,872
What do you
think about that?

101
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,049
I think it sounds great.

102
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,348
A little bit
up on the left.

103
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,956
Oh, it looks great.
Looks great.

104
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,359
Yeah.

105
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,658
You're the
new renters?

106
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,424
Well, hello.
Harvey Milk.

107
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:24,934
McConnely.
Welcome to Castro Camera.

108
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,266
Scott.

109
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,207
Yeah. Like,
you know, I would like

110
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:33,177
to join the, what's it called, The
Eureka Valley Merchants Association.

111
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,439
I'm not an interloper.

112
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:37,277
A Jew, perhaps, but I
hope you'll forgive that.

113
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,839
If you open
those doors,

114
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,887
the Merchants Association will
have the police pull your license.

115
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:43,421
Under what law?

116
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,184
Excuse me?

117
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:48,317
There's man's law and there's
God's law in this neighborhood

118
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,520
and in this city.

119
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,119
You know,
we pay taxes.

120
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:54,564
The San Francisco police force
is happy to enforce either.

121
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:55,691
Have a good day.

122
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,931
Yeah, thank you for the warm
welcome to the neighborhood!

123
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,805
Schmuck!

124
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:04,734
Well.

125
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:07,472
Hey.

126
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,450
Okay.
Customers, come on in.

127
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,639
We'll form our
own business association.

128
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,906
We'll start with
the gay businesses.

129
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,882
We'll get the addresses of every customer
that comes in the store for a roll of film

130
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,317
and we'll ask them what they
want, what they need changed.

131
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:51,550
We'll get some money rolling in
here. Revitalize the neighborhood.

132
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,023
Can I come in now?

133
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,785
One more minute.

134
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,894
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

135
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,865
They must have
some gay customers.

136
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,597
Look, Harvey, what's with all
this political activist crap?

137
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,231
I mean, I thought you
were a goddamn Republican.

138
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,241
I'm a businessman, Scott.

139
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,608
And businesses should be
good to their customers.

140
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,477
Even if their
customers are gay.

141
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,540
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

142
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,450
Yeah. Well, it's just like
any other city in the country.

143
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,044
They hate us.
Real surprise.

144
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,955
We should have at least one
block in one city, right?

145
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,756
We start there and then we'll
take over the neighborhood.

146
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,159
Maybe.

147
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:33,692
I'm coming in.

148
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,961
Okay,
you can come in now.

149
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:41,304
Finally.
This better be good.

150
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,372
Oh!

151
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,608
Happy birthday!

152
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:51,845
I had to do it! I had
to do it! I had to do it!

153
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,044
Sanctuary, sanctuary!
Harvey Milk!

154
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,108
Sanctuary!

155
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,884
And Castro became
destination number one.

156
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,425
Hundreds of gay men were coming
every week from all over the world.

157
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,723
<i>It was our area.
Our own neighborhood.</i>

158
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,440
<i>The police hated us. And
we hated them right back.</i>

159
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,809
<i>They would come in and attack
us and beat us just for fun.</i>

160
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,281
<i>But that wouldn't stop us.</i>

161
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:29,515
<i>I made a list of shops that were
friendly to us and shops that weren't.</i>

162
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,818
<i>Those shops that
worked with us thrived.</i>

163
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,188
<i>Those that didn't,
went out of business.</i>

164
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,453
<i>Closed their doors.</i>

165
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,156
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,464
Mr. McConnely, I just came by
to see how business was doing.

167
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:45,867
Just fine, Harvey.

168
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,429
You don't mind having all
these homosexuals in here?

169
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,076
Kidding, everybody. He
loves our kind. Spend away.

170
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,475
Tell your wife I said hello.

171
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:58,448
But people started
hanging around our store.

172
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,452
Not customers.
Activists, kids,

173
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:05,256
young people who were looking
for a home away from home.

174
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:27,806
<i>There was Danny Nicoletta,</i>

175
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,475
<i>cute art student that I picked up
at Toad Hall, who worked in the shop.</i>

176
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,314
<i>Harvey, come on.
Opera is so passé.</i>

177
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:35,785
You're not understanding
the spectacle of it,

178
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,287
the bigger
than life emotions.

179
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,256
The bigger
than life emotions?

180
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,488
Jim Rivaldo, a great mind.

181
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:51,730
Harvard graduate, which nobody cared
about in those days in the Castro.

182
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:53,066
Including himself.

183
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:56,005
<i>And somewhere along the
line, Jim picked up a protégé,</i>

184
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,873
a cute political kid from
Wisconsin, Dick Pabich.

185
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,344
And of course,
there was Dennis Peron,

186
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:05,008
<i>who ran a very successful
business with the young kids.</i>

187
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,315
And it wasn't only the gays
who noticed what was happening.

188
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,345
Also the straight people.

189
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,586
There were some
very unexpected ones.

190
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,788
Teamster leader Allan Baird
walked right into my shop

191
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:21,890
<i>and asked me if I could get my
people to help boycott Coors beer.</i>

192
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,561
<i>And the Coors beer boycott
had not been too successful.</i>

193
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:28,834
<i>But I got my people to get all the
Coors beer out of all the gay bars,</i>

194
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:32,399
<i>and immediately Coors fell
from number one and they caved.</i>

195
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:36,510
<i>A week later, the Teamsters
union, for the very first time,</i>

196
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,413
<i>hired openly gay drivers.</i>

197
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,645
<i>We weren't just a bunch
of pansies anymore.</i>

198
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,051
<i>We had had our
first taste of power.</i>

199
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:46,580
And it was about that time
that someone first called me

200
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:51,493
the Mayor of Castro Street, or I
may have invented the term myself.

201
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,228
The fucking cops, man.

202
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:58,735
Cops are pulling
people out of Toad Hall.

203
00:15:58,804 --> 00:15:59,736
Why?
What did they do?

204
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,534
They're sweeping the streets.
It's happening right now.

205
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:02,972
Come on.
Come on.

206
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,827
Through the door there,
the front door there,

207
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:35,567
was just an explosion
of police charging in here.

208
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,838
I ran into the bathroom to
hide with some other people.

209
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:45,082
All we could hear was screaming
and crunching and smashing.

210
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,053
It was frankly the most terrifying
experience I've had in my life.

211
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,520
If we had
someone in government

212
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,533
who saw things the
way that we see them,

213
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:07,163
like the black community has black
leaders that look out for their interests.

214
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,040
Politics is theater.

215
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:18,309
It doesn't matter
so much about winning.

216
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:19,407
You make a statement.

217
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:23,113
You say, "I'm here. ' '
You get their attention.

218
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,447
I mean, it'll be fun.

219
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,493
Even though the Castro was firmly our
area by 1973, it wasn't safe for us.

220
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:40,504
We would have to wear whistles
on our necks or in our pockets.

221
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,268
<i>And if you ever heard a
whistle, you would run to help.</i>

222
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:47,773
Fruit was walking home with
his trick when he got jumped.

223
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,406
Name's Robert Hillsborough.
Did you know him?

224
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,112
He used to come into my
shop. Are there any witnesses?

225
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,484
Yeah, just
the trick, Jerry Taylor.

226
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:59,080
Jerry's not his
trick, he's his lover.

227
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,522
Hey,
call it what you will.

228
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:04,050
All we know is he's our only witness and
he said he can't identify the attackers.

229
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,495
Oh, you'd have a dozen witnesses
if they thought you boys had any

230
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,590
real interest
in protecting them.

231
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:27,543
<i>SCO TT ON PA/ Hey, come on. Come
over. Everyone gather around.</i>

232
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,382
Hey, Milk,
good job on Coors.

233
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:32,719
Thank you and we were very happy to
do that. We were very happy to do that.

234
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,816
<i>Everyone over here,
gather around.</i>

235
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:43,061
<i>Hello. I'm Harvey Milk.</i>

236
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:47,928
<i>A week ago,</i>

237
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:53,604
<i>police officers came into
our area with badges covered.</i>

238
00:18:55,147 --> 00:19:00,175
<i>They sent 14 of our people
to hospitals and to jail.</i>

239
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,813
<i>The charges,
"Blocking the sidewalk. "</i>

240
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:10,621
<i>Let's let our tax money go to our
protection, not our persecution.</i>

241
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,821
<i>Worry about gun control,
not marijuana control.</i>

242
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,597
<i>School supplies, seniors,
not the books we read!</i>

243
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:25,739
<i>My fellow degenerates,</i>

244
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:32,583
<i>I would like to announce my candidacy
for San Francisco City Supervisor!</i>

245
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,148
How are you, Lee?
Fine, thank you.

246
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,215
Oh, I bought you some flowers
to brighten up your day.

247
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,761
Could I leave some
flyers for your customers?

248
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,723
Hello, everyone.

249
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,321
Harvey Milk,
running for supervisor.

250
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,889
<i>We need your support.</i>

251
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,935
Are you registered
to vote?

252
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,233
Let me just give you that. It's for
Harvey Milk for supervisor, all right?

253
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,773
<i>He's running for the Board of
Supervisors. Right. Thank you.</i>

254
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,001
<i>Take care.
Have a good day.</i>

255
00:19:57,075 --> 00:20:01,774
Harvey Milk for supervisor! Excuse
me, ma'am, are you registered to vote?

256
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,439
Sir, are you
registered to vote?

257
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,983
I'm Harvey Milk, sir.
I'm running for supervisor.

258
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,576
I want you to know that my
campaign is very interested

259
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:10,348
in taking care of
seniors in the area.

260
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,946
<i>We've been doing
a lot about reaching out.</i>

261
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:15,687
I'm Harvey Milk. Will you register
here if you're not registered?

262
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:20,993
Hey, I like the way those pants
fit! Where are you from, kid?

263
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,330
Sorry, old man,
not interested.

264
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,461
Where's home?

265
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,095
Phoenix.

266
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:29,766
Come here.
Just come here a minute.

267
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,444
I'm Harvey Milk. I'm
running for supervisor.

268
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:36,640
What's your name?

269
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,580
Cleve Jones.

270
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,880
Cleve Jones.
You're adorable.

271
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,912
We should get you over here and
get you registered, Mr. Jones.

272
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,886
Fuck that.
Elections of any kind

273
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,052
are fucking
bourgeois affectation.

274
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,789
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,161
What do you do,
trick up on Polk Street?

276
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,294
If I need the cash.

277
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,839
But I'm a little bit more selective
about my clients than you are.

278
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:04,671
Okay, let me ask you one thing
before you go back to work.

279
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,836
What was it like to be
a little queer in Phoenix?

280
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:09,403
Did all the jocks beat
you up in gym class?

281
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,881
I faked a lung disease
to get out of P.E.

282
00:21:15,954 --> 00:21:18,582
So what, what are you?
Some kind of street shrink?

283
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:20,090
Sometimes.

284
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:23,286
But what I'm talking about
is that we can change Phoenix.

285
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,957
But we have to
start with our street.

286
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:32,729
Police abuse, rent control,
pot, parks, seniors issues.

287
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:34,704
Good luck
with all that.

288
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,366
Good luck.

289
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,041
You know what I think,
Cleve Jones?

290
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,943
That you're gonna get
somewhere if you keep talking.

291
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,243
No. I think you should
do what you do well.

292
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:45,840
You should
be a prick.

293
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:50,013
But come with us and be a prick.
Fight City Hall. Fight the cops.

294
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:52,613
Fight the people that made you
come here to do what you do.

295
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,558
Sorry, old man, I'm leaving
for Spain tomorrow. Europe.

296
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:58,027
All the cash I need
is in my back pocket.

297
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm just saying that at this point,
it looks like all the big guns,

298
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,833
all the gay money,
the real money,

299
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,275
is gonna get
behind Feinstein

300
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,869
and all the straight candidates
they consider "gay-friendly. ' '

301
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,777
Who cares about
those old queens?

302
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:17,974
Well, you need
them to get elected.

303
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,847
Why isn't my campaign
manager leading this meeting?

304
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,547
'Cause I'm exhausted. I've been
handing out pamphlets for seven hours.

305
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:24,884
Yeah, in a bathhouse.

306
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:26,856
And who are these so-called
gay leaders anyway?

307
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,450
Who appointed them?
What are you suggesting, Jim?

308
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,723
That I go down there and
solicit their endorsement?

309
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:34,924
I mean, we're down here trying to help
people on the streets. Where are they?

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,195
Yeah, I know, but... You
need an endorsement, Harvey.

311
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,531
Take this.

312
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:39,900
Checking the exposure.

313
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:41,939
They're nice pictures.

314
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,907
Is he your boyfriend?
Sort of.

315
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,742
<i>Harvey, David Goodstein is a
publisher from The Advocate.</i>

316
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,210
Harvey.
He's got a house...

317
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,478
Harvey, I think
you got to see this.

318
00:22:56,354 --> 00:22:58,788
"Harvey Milk will
have a dream journey

319
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,917
"and nightmare to hell,
a night of horror.

320
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:07,090
"You will be stabbed and have your
genitals, cock, balls and prick cut off. ' '

321
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:09,528
I'm calling the police.

322
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:13,264
They probably wrote it.
Look, think of it this way.

323
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,272
If they try to kill me,
I'll get the sympathy vote.

324
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,672
That might be
just the push we need.

325
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:20,438
You think this is funny?
Look at it.

326
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,410
It's a total joke.

327
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:27,576
I mean, it's got no rhythm,
no humor. It's insulting.

328
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,347
Don't do that.

329
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:34,051
No, if you put it away,
you put it in a drawer,

330
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,093
it just gets
bigger and scarier.

331
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:39,062
Here, it's right here. We see
it every day. It can't get us.

332
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:43,834
Gonna spend all this energy
to make yourself a target?

333
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:45,699
For something you're
not gonna even win?

334
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,864
I keep telling you, it's
not just about winning.

335
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:53,167
<i>HARVEY/ The top gays in San
Francisco were David Goodstein</i>

336
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,805
<i>and his civil rights lawyer
sidekick, Rick Stokes.</i>

337
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,043
<i>David was a rich old queen who had bought
the biggest gay magazine, The Advocate.</i>

338
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:01,813
Hello. Hello, welcome
to Mr. Goodstein's.

339
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:02,978
Milo.

340
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:07,123
I worked for a financial
institution in New York.

341
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,716
I was very discreet.

342
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:10,852
One night I went to
the Metropolitan Opera,

343
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,897
<i>II Trovatore, Verdi.</i>

344
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:15,330
I was sitting in a
box, next to my lover.

345
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:18,898
Someone spotted us.
Next day I was fired.

346
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:22,069
So I decided to do
something about it.

347
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,007
<i>Came out here to San Francisco,
I bought The Advocate.</i>

348
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:30,312
I use my money and my influence, in very
subtle and quiet ways, to do what I can.

349
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,879
So you think that backing
straight candidates

350
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,145
is the best
way to help us?

351
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:36,187
Yeah, if they're
friendly to our cause.

352
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:38,188
Supervisor is
a citywide office.

353
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,985
Political alliances
have to be built.

354
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:44,188
You can't just move here from across
the country and run for that office.

355
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:45,729
But I am running for office.

356
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:47,094
I'm on the ballot.

357
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:49,292
I have the union rank and
file, I have the seniors.

358
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,165
And I would like to have
your magazine's endorsement.

359
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:56,607
Harvey, we're like
the Catholic church.

360
00:24:56,675 --> 00:25:00,202
We welcome converts, but we
don't make them Pope the same day.

361
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:02,371
Why haven't
you run yet?

362
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:05,416
Too early.
Especially from the Castro.

363
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,318
What's wrong
with the Castro?

364
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:11,321
Nobody works there. It's all
about sex and drugs and more sex.

365
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,687
David, we need one
of our own in office.

366
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,663
Harvey, you can't demand
acceptance overnight.

367
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:20,857
Why not?

368
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:23,628
The more "out" you make us,
the more you incite them.

369
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,603
Harvey, step back and quiet down.

370
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,832
You're suggesting we should
go back in the closet?

371
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,306
Is that what
you're saying?

372
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,344
I spent more years in the
closet than I care to remember.

373
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,038
Let's go, Scott.
Yeah.

374
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:36,546
I don't need your
magazine's endorsement.

375
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:39,708
And I'm not asking for anyone's
acceptance. I don't have time.

376
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:43,311
For you,
politics is a game, a lark.

377
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:46,221
It's like putting on a rock
festival or staging a love-in.

378
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,384
You're too old to be
a hippie, Harvey Milk.

379
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,395
I am not a candidate.
I am part of a movement.

380
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:54,489
The movement is the candidate.
There is a difference.

381
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,500
You don't see it,
but I do.

382
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,729
Sorry, I, uh,
pissed in the pool.

383
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:07,504
So, on election day, out of 32
candidates vying for six seats,

384
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,878
<i>we came in tenth.
We lost.</i>

385
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:17,752
But only a few votes shy of my becoming
the first big eared, cock-sucking,

386
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,758
queer as a
three-dollar-bill-man

387
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:23,851
<i>to be elected
to public office.</i>

388
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:28,124
So we decided to
try it again in 1975.

389
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,993
<i>Only this time,
with a few adjustments.</i>

390
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:38,099
No. No, not cute. I hate the shoes.

391
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:40,007
I hate the hair.
You're not fooling anybody.

392
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,342
I'm not gonna let those
little Pacific Heights biddies

393
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:45,212
write me off anymore because
of a ponytail. I like it.

394
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:49,845
No more bathhouses, no more
pot, for me and my little poo.

395
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,154
Speak for yourself.
Come on.

396
00:26:53,224 --> 00:27:00,392
We ran and lost the supervisor's
race for the second time in 1975,

397
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:03,457
but with more votes than ever before.

398
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:09,402
So in 1976,
against everyone's advice,

399
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:12,671
<i>I really pissed off
the political power houses</i>

400
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:15,804
<i>in the Democratic party by
running against their man,</i>

401
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,475
<i>Art Agnos, who was part
of their political machine.</i>

402
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:22,611
<i>And this time, not for
supervisor, but for a bigger job,</i>

403
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,484
<i>for the California
State Assembly.</i>

404
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,821
I don't think that State Assembly
seats should be the reward

405
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:29,757
for service to the
Democratic party machine.

406
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,422
Machines run on oil and
grease. They're dirty.

407
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:36,957
They're dehumanizing. And they
tend to be entirely unresponsive

408
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:40,061
to the needs of anybody,
but those of their operator.

409
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:44,134
Mr. Milk, I've been a social
worker in this city for years.

410
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:46,006
I know Sacramento.

411
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:48,545
I know how to get done
what we all need done there.

412
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:52,310
Tell me something, Mr. Agnos,
right here in the Castro,

413
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:57,150
Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for
walking home with his longtime partner.

414
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,087
He was stabbed 15 times.

415
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:04,625
The last words he heard were,
"Faggot, faggot, faggot. ' '

416
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:08,393
Now, you say
you're outraged.

417
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:14,965
Why then does your liberal
establishment refuse to answer our calls?

418
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,769
Why do they not bring
these murderers to justice?

419
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:23,444
My God, you're handsome up close.

420
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:27,449
Can't tell you how much I'm
looking forward to licking you,

421
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,781
in the polls.

422
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:32,752
You know, Harv, your
whole rap's a real downer.

423
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,055
You talk a lot about
what you're against.

424
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:37,719
But what are you for?

425
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:42,164
In this town, you got to give them a
reason for optimism, or you're cooked.

426
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:48,102
See you around.

427
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:49,104
Okay, Art.

428
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:51,605
You're gonna wanna
read that entire thing.

429
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,007
Okay,
I'll take a look at it.

430
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,442
Excuse me.

431
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:56,480
Guys.
Don't touch that.

432
00:28:57,115 --> 00:29:00,175
Harvey. Harvey, dinner. Have
to get some union boys in there.

433
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:02,685
They love me,
they love me.

434
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,356
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

435
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,021
Harvey, you have to eat.

436
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:15,156
Everyone, the apartment
is now off limits!

437
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:17,064
Good night.
Good night.

438
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,237
Good night.
Whose jacket is this?

439
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,136
Right here.
Here you go. Good night.

440
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:25,004
Down the stairs.
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:28,177
Good night. Thank you.

442
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,941
I think you got to call the guy,
'cause I can't talk to that guy.

443
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:31,572
Sit.

444
00:29:32,884 --> 00:29:35,284
Don't say anything.

445
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:47,829
Can I just tell you...

446
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,062
If you say anything about
politics or the campaign,

447
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:53,330
or what speech you
have to give or anything,

448
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,964
I swear to God I'm gonna
stab you with this fork.

449
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:03,037
I just wanted to say that this is the
most wonderful dinner I have ever had.

450
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:11,755
If we lose this, it'll
just be you and me again.

451
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:13,688
I promise.

452
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,487
I'm sorry, I just...

453
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,690
No, I know.
I know, I know.

454
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,489
Phoenix.

455
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:26,994
At least now
you look gay.

456
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:35,999
Let's go inside.

457
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:49,211
Are you
staying up with me?

458
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,451
The election's tomorrow.
I won't sleep anyway.

459
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:04,363
Was he handsome?

460
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:07,632
Oh, no!
He was hideous.

461
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:14,410
Usually when my lovers leave, they
cheat with even more attractive men.

462
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,313
I actually thought we were gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

463
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:32,662
Well, guess what, Cleve Jones.

464
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:35,190
What?

465
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:39,396
You're going to meet the
most extraordinary men,

466
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,735
the sexiest, funniest, brightest men.

467
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:45,332
You're going to meet so many of them,
fall in love with so many of them,

468
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,967
you won't know till
the end of your life

469
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:50,571
which ones were your greatest lovers
and which were your greatest friends.

470
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,580
Is that supposed to help?

471
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:56,982
Maybe a little. Or not.

472
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,764
I went to
Spain last month.

473
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,165
Long story.

474
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:18,106
In Barcelona, there
was this memorial march

475
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,770
for gay people that
had died under Franco.

476
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,578
Of course, the police
tried to break it up.

477
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,708
But these queens didn't run.
No.

478
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,220
They turned around and
they started a fucking riot.

479
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,121
I saw a bullet, one of
those big rubber bullets

480
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:37,287
rip through a drag queen's
scalp, but she kept on fighting.

481
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,888
She was screaming,
but she kept on fighting.

482
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:43,088
I mean...

483
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,634
Our lives.

484
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,507
There was blood literally
running in the gutter.

485
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:56,074
In a gutter.

486
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:02,613
We could have
a revolution here.

487
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,281
But you can't use the
Castro just to cruise.

488
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,785
You have to fight.

489
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,623
You really think you'll win?

490
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,794
Winning is
not my strong suit.

491
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,269
Well,

492
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,272
I don't do losing, ever.

493
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,642
Maybe I should run for office
and you can work for me.

494
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,874
I mean, if you can do it...

495
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:33,109
Can you assemble a
thousand people in an hour?

496
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:34,310
Fuck, yeah.

497
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,910
Well, if I run again,
you're gonna be my man.

498
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,249
Lf?

499
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,885
You're so adorable.

500
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:46,029
The polls are open in 3 hours.

501
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:49,228
How about you and
I hit the bus stops?

502
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:52,091
Okay.

503
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:58,808
<i>Yes, Jesus</i>

504
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,976
<i>Loves me</i>

505

<i>Anita Bryant was once

<i>which protects homosexuals
in jobs and housing.</i>

512

<i>the very foundation, the family

<i>There are those people

518
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,657
<i>kind of an eye for an eye
law that is at work here,</i>

519
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,251
<i>that you're denying homosexuals
many of their rights as well.</i>

520
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,321
<i>You see, if homosexuals are
allowed their civil rights,</i>

521
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:57,265
<i>then so would prostitutes
or thieves or anyone else.</i>

522
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,599
<i>God puts it in
a category of morality.</i>

523
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,831
<i>Doesn't that necessarily
follow that you believe that</i>

524
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,567
<i>homosexuality
ought to be illegal?</i>

525
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,109
<i>ANITA/ I do believe that
it should be illegal.</i>

526
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:08,577
Well, we lost, but
we didn't lose by much.

527
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,679
More votes than ever!

528
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,550
That used to
make you laugh.

529
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,317
Harvey, I got to
show you something.

530
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:24,260
This is incredible.

531
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:31,492
If we can get that new initiative
on district elections to go through,

532
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,037
and we can, we can,

533
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,940
the boundary for the
new supervisor district

534
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:42,739
is gonna go right
down Market Street,

535
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:48,818
right around the
Haight like this,

536
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,250
and right around
the Castro.

537
00:36:58,195 --> 00:37:00,755
The Haight and the Castro.
That's it.

538
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:06,327
If these are the only people we have
to convince, the hippies and the gays,

539
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:09,796
you win, you win.

540
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:13,105
You win by a landslide.

541
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:22,519
You'll be the first openly gay man
elected to major office in the U.S.

542
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:29,681
I don't know if I
have another one in me.

543
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,318
Or Scotty.

544
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:35,626
Yeah, well.

545
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:51,606
Relentless man.
Oh, you're a relentless man.

<i>This is the CBS

00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,881
<i>I am here tonight to say</i>

615
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:03,190
<i>that we will no longer
sit quietly in the closet.</i>

616
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:06,454
<i>We must fight.</i>

617
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,192
<i>And not only
in the Castro,</i>

618
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:12,497
<i>not only in
San Francisco,</i>

619
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:15,197
<i>but everywhere
the Anitas go.</i>

620
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,434
<i>Anita Bryant
did not win tonight.</i>

621
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:23,313
<i>Anita Bryant
brought us together!</i>

622
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:32,216
<i>She is going to create
a national gay force!</i>

623
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:42,326
<i>And the young people
in Jackson, Mississippi,</i>

624
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:47,228
<i>in Minnesota,
in the Richmond,</i>

625
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:49,930
<i>in Woodmere, New York,</i>

626
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:55,869
<i>who are hearing
her on television,</i>

627
00:43:55,946 --> 00:43:59,848
<i>hearing Anita Bryant
on television,</i>

628
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:04,217
<i>telling them they are
sick, they are wrong,</i>

629
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:09,417
<i>there is no place in this
great country for them,</i>

630
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:12,053
<i>no place in this world,</i>

631
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:15,621
<i>they are looking to us
for something tonight.</i>

632
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,091
<i>And I say</i>

633
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:22,434
<i>we have got to
give them hope!</i>

634
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:26,533
<i>Hope!</i>

635
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:30,474
...for a better world.
Hope for a better tomorrow.

636
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:34,580
Hope for a better place to come into
if the pressures at home are too great.

637
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:38,485
Hope for the worker who
awakens from the American dream

638
00:44:38,555 --> 00:44:41,388
only to find that all the
jobs have left the country.

639
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,449
We've got to
give them hope.

640
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:59,798
When San Francisco
changed its voting rules,

641
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:02,846
so that people could elect people
from their own neighborhood,

642
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:07,009
so that the blacks could elect
a African-American supervisor,

643
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:10,110
and in Chinatown, they could
elect a Chinese supervisor,

644
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:14,248
and in the Castro, they could choose
between myself and Rick Stokes.

645
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,725
<i>But decent art
begs balance, right?</i>

646
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:20,194
<i>So, little district eight,
two miles south of the Castro,</i>

647
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:24,360
<i>still very much the same.
Irish Catholic, conservative.</i>

648
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:26,698
<i>And with just the
right amount of poetry,</i>

649
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,568
<i>they found themselves
a handsome ex-cop.</i>

650
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:32,533
See, I'm not going to be
forced out of San Francisco

651
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,740
by splinter groups of social radicals,
social deviants, and incorrigibles.

652
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:41,716
Now you must realize that there are
thousands upon thousands of frustrated,

653
00:45:41,785 --> 00:45:44,447
angry people,
such as yourselves,

654
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:47,718
just waiting to unleash
a fury that will eradicate

655
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,726
the malignancies that
blight our beautiful city.

656
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:57,500
Just one more. We can't let
Rick Stokes take this one.

657
00:45:57,568 --> 00:45:59,399
Let Rick Stokes
take it.

658
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,207
Sorry.

659
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,082
I can't do another one.

660
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:01,092
Oh, God damn it.

661
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,021
Bring out the old,
bring in the new.

662
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:27,352
This is over. Done.

663
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:30,359
I don't want to see one more thing
that says fucking Assembly on it.

664
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:35,490
'Cause this three time faggot
loser is running for supervisor.

665
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:37,624
There she is.
Who the heck is that?

666
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:39,726
That's our
new campaign manager.

667
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:42,863
She called last week to volunteer
and I asked for her help.

668
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,669
Help or take over?
What about Scott?

669
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:47,232
We need new blood.

670
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:51,110
Gentlemen, Anne Kronenberg.
A woman.

671
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:54,708
A woman who likes women.
And that's odd, isn't it?

672
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,343
Hi, guys.

673
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,083
Mr. Milk, Rick Stokes isn't pulling out.

674
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,591
He's officially filed
to run against you.

675
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:05,958
<i>My friend at The Advocate says
David Goodstein is backing him.</i>

676
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:08,259
So, a gay candidate
against a gay candidate.

677
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:09,764
That's unfortunate.

678
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,095
Let's find out when they
are going to announce.

679
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,999
So you replaced
Scott with a lesbian?

680
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,368
Anne worked on a recycling
campaign up north.

681
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,033
She's very, very organized.
We need that.

682
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:20,133
How do you know she's
not a plant for Rick Stokes?

683
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,440
Are you guys
always this paranoid?

684
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:25,106
Yes. We take after Harvey.

685
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:27,116
Don't you have someone's
laundry to do?

686
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,049
Shouldn't you be at
a hairdressing convention?

687
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:32,955
Sir, my girlfriends say
you guys don't like women.

688
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,285
I'm just asking.

689
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:38,088
Is there a place for us in all
this or are you all scared of girls?

690
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,588
Okay, gentlemen,

691
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,998
we've already got a tinker
bell, a lotus blossom.

692
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:46,695
We've got Jim and Dick
in their three-piece suits.

693
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:50,968
We need someone to manage
things. A woman this time.

694
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:53,870
Plus,
she's the right price,

695
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:56,412
and she's got bigger balls
than anybody else in here.

696
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,812
Just give me whatever is in the
register at the end of the day.

697
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:04,616
<i>So should I call The Chronicle about
getting us an actual endorsement this time?</i>

698
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:05,814
No?

699
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:08,790
<i>Yeah, call The Chronicle,
sweetheart. Tell them I said hi.</i>

700
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:11,692
Please call. In fact,
don't drive down there.

701
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,559
You'll scare
the shit out of them.

702
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:16,856
Call.

703
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:18,025
All right.

704
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:19,500
Hi, I'm Cleve.

705
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:21,264
Anne. Good to meet you.

706
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:24,102
I was telling Harvey we needed
some tough dykes around here, so...

707
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,573
Well, you got one.

708
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:16,684
All right.

709
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,752
First ever newspaper
endorsement.

710
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,526
<i>And we got
the Bay Guardian,</i>

711
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,329
<i>The Sentinel and
The Bay Area Reporter.</i>

712
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:33,175
You are pulling your weight.
Oh, this is sensational!

713
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:37,240
They endorsed you for
being a good businessman?

714
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:40,215
Oh, my gosh, you really
are a miracle worker.

715
00:50:40,283 --> 00:50:42,615
Scott has got to read this.
He's just gonna piss himself.

716
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,415
Yeah,
you should show him.

717
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:46,617
You know what you should do, Cleve,

718
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,989
you should get yourself a boy to
celebrate with, just in case we win.

719
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,459
Anybody want to
buy me a drink?

720
00:50:51,528 --> 00:50:53,359
Oh, I will buy you
a drink.

721
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,897
How about a bottle
of champagne?

722
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:59,430
We are going to The Stud
right fucking now.

723
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:01,470
Harvey, are you going to
come? You're gonna miss out?

724
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:04,268
Go, go, go, go. I want
to be with my newspaper.

725
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,771
Come on, let's go.
Come on, I'm buying.

726
00:51:08,845 --> 00:51:11,370
You're not buying.
You don't have any money.

727
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,652
Gonna win this time, Milk?

728
00:52:00,897 --> 00:52:03,161
You look more
handsome in the poster.

729
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,593
Oh, thank you.

730
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:12,102
You know, palominos
are my favorite horse.

731
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,304
They're smart.

732
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:17,243
But they're
compact and fast.

733
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:19,248
I like that.

734
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:26,588
You think I'm more
like a palomino,

735
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:30,318
or a stallion?

736
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:33,585
You know,
with big balls and...

737
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,826
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here, let me help you.

738
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:40,998
You okay?

739
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:43,096
Yeah, it's...
Come in.

740
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,937
Here, just lean on me.

741
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:47,442
Thank you.
What happened?

742
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,774
I don't know, these
boots are too big for me.

743
00:52:49,846 --> 00:52:53,839
Oh, well, let's get you in
and get those off your feet.

744
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,215
Where you going?

745
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,379
I have
some things to do.

746
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:01,083
I got to go and meet
some friends. No, no, no.

747
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:14,369
My father beat
me when he found out.

748
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:17,071
So, that's
why I came here.

749
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:24,644
But, I'm living with this
guy that... I don't know.

750
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:27,180
I don't like him.

751
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:32,348
Nobody will
ever beat you again.

752
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:40,458
I love you.
I love you.

753
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,699
Do you even
remember my name?

754
00:53:48,905 --> 00:53:50,532
No.

755
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:51,801
Harvey.

756
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:54,438
I'm Harvey.

757
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:58,509
Harvey, I love you.

758
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:10,818
Thanks.

759
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:11,986
Thank you.

760
00:54:22,972 --> 00:54:25,702
<i>For the first
time, it all came together.</i>

761
00:54:25,775 --> 00:54:31,611
<i>The union boys, women, the
seniors, the gays and minorities.</i>

762
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,979
<i>All of the "us's"
showed up.</i>

763
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,984
<i>We can hear it,
we can't really see too much,</i>

764
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:38,486
<i>but it looks and sounds
to you and to me</i>

765
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:40,887
<i>like New Year's Eve
on Market Street.</i>

766
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:47,458
We did it!

767
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,464
I love you all!

768
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:09,581
We are the movement. We are
the movement. Thank you so much.

769
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:11,585
Come on, we just want
to congratulate him.

770
00:55:11,654 --> 00:55:14,214
No, I understand, but
right now we're all full.

771
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,827
Harvey!

772
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,022
Harvey!
Harvey!

773
00:55:21,097 --> 00:55:23,327
Hey, Harvey!

774
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:25,960
Hey.

775
00:55:26,035 --> 00:55:29,436
Sorry, it's just so crowded.

776
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,770
Come in, sorry, sorry.

777
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:34,537
It's so crowded.
It's just so crowded.

778
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:36,970
Harvey, man!

779
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:43,344
Scotty!

780
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,786
Is this all for you, Harvey?
Are you this famous, baby?

781
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:49,825
No, we do this all the time.
You like it?

782
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:50,951
Yeah.

783
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:54,793
The new Mrs. Milk.
I give it a week.

784
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:59,096
Gordon Lau, Carol Ruth Silver. It's the
most liberal board in years. In history!

785
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:01,600
What about Dan White?
Did he win?

786
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:03,969
We'll deal with him tomorrow. Oh, God.

787
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:19,050
<i>Does this mean,
as many straights are concerned,</i>

788
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:21,955
<i>maybe the gays are taking
over San Francisco?</i>

789
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:25,222
<i>Are you going to be a
supervisor for all the people?</i>

790
00:56:25,295 --> 00:56:27,695
<i>Well, I have to be. That's
what I was elected for.</i>

791
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:30,358
<i>I have to be there to
open for the dialogue,</i>

792
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:33,402
<i>for the sensitivities of all
people and all their problems.</i>

793
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:36,302
<i>The problems that affect
this city, affect us all.</i>

794
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,430
<i>Okay, well,
congratulations.</i>

795
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:40,999
<i>Thank you.
Thank you, San Francisco!</i>

796
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:44,277
<i>And that's Harvey Milk,</i>

797
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:47,282
<i>celebrating his election to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</i>

798
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,648
<i>For Channel Five news,
I'm Mary Dilts.</i>

799
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:56,389
<i>I, Harvey Milk,
do solemnly swear...</i>

800
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:03,257
<i>That I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States...</i>

801
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:07,030
<i>During such time as I
hold the office of supervisor,</i>

802
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:09,970
<i>City and County
of San Francisco.</i>

803
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:13,702
During such time as I hold
the office of supervisor,

804
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:16,370
City and County
of San Francisco.

805
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:18,607
Congratulations, Harvey.
Thank you, Mayor.

806
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:26,653
<i>Anita Bryant said that it was gay people
that brought the drought to California.</i>

807
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:31,316
<i>Well, it looks to me as though
it's finally started raining.</i>

808
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:34,222
<i>This will be
the first time in many years</i>

809
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:37,266
<i>that we've seen so many new
faces on the Board of Supervisors.</i>

810
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,325
Do you think such diversity
will cripple the board?

811
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:43,702
Well, the name of the game is
six votes to get anything passed.

812
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:45,263
So, whether you like it or not,

813
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:47,502
Dan and I are
in bed together.

814
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:49,067
Politically speaking.

815
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:51,640
<i>You see, I've assured
Harvey here that, uh,</i>

816
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:54,239
<i>my brochure's comments
about social deviants</i>

817
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:57,252
<i>referred more to junkies
than to his people.</i>

818
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,447
<i>See, I'm about to
have my first child</i>

819
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:03,288
<i>and I had to make sure that this city
remains a decent place to raise him.</i>

820
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:07,225
<i>Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show, gentlemen,</i>

821
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:08,924
<i>and we'll see what happens.</i>

822
00:58:08,998 --> 00:58:10,226
<i>HARVEY/ That's it?
It's over? We're finished?</i>

823
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,358
<i>Yes.</i>

824
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:13,368
<i>That was quick.
Thank you.</i>

825
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:15,631
How long were
you a fireman, Dan?

826
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,104
A couple of years.

827
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:19,198
And you were a police
officer before that?

828
00:58:19,275 --> 00:58:21,038
You got something
against cops, Harv?

829
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,340
No, no. They tend
to against me though.

830
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:25,847
But firefighters,
they're the true heroes.

831
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,679
They supported me on my last
campaign. I fully support them.

832
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,412
I appreciate that.

833
00:58:30,486 --> 00:58:32,454
I meant what I said.
I'd like to work together.

834
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:34,149
Me, too.
I'll see you later.

835
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:35,212
Okay.

836
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:51,832
Oh. What do you think of my new theater?

837
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:53,375
A bit over the top.

838
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:57,375
You're
wearing a suit?

839
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:58,778
I got it
from a friend.

840
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:00,042
No, no, no, no.

841
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:03,745
Anytime you come here, I want you
to wear the tightest jeans possible.

842
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,846
Never blend in. And
never take the elevator.

843
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:08,185
Always use
the stairs.

844
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:13,251
You can make such a grand
entrance by taking these stairs.

845
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:14,823
Hello.

846
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:16,889
Carol, friend.

847
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:19,767
Dan White.

848
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:23,099
Hello, Dianne.

849
00:59:25,174 --> 00:59:27,404
And then this is
Gordon Lau's office.

850
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:29,035
Anne, can you set Cleve up on mail?

851
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,272
Will do.

852
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:33,347
Okay,

853
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,611
first order of business
to come out of this office

854
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:37,380
is a citywide
Gay Rights Ordinance,

855
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:40,183
just like the one that Anita
shot down in Dade County.

856
00:59:40,256 --> 00:59:41,416
What do you think,
Lotus Blossom?

857
00:59:41,491 --> 00:59:43,618
I think it's good.
It's not great.

858
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:47,686
Okay, so make it brilliant. We want
Anita's attention here in San Francisco.

859
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,857
I want her to bring her fight to us.

860
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:52,958
We need a unanimous
vote, we need headlines.

861
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:54,662
Dan White is not
gonna vote for this.

862
00:59:54,737 --> 00:59:55,965
Dan White will be fine.

863
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:58,302
Dan White is just
uneducated. We'll teach him.

864
00:59:58,374 --> 01:00:00,934
Hey, Harv,
committee meets at 9:30.

865
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:02,470
Hey, you guys.

866
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:05,309
Say, did you get the invitation
to my son's christening?

867
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:07,178
I invited a few of
the other Supes, too.

868
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,013
Oh, I'll be there.

869
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:10,882
Great! Thanks.

870
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,789
Did he hear you?
What the fuck!

871
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:15,721
Are you going?

872
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,989
I would let him christen me if it means
he's gonna vote for the Gay Rights Ordinance.

873
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:21,689
We need allies.
We need everyone.

874
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:23,888
I don't think
he heard you.

875
01:00:23,966 --> 01:00:25,695
Is it just me
or is he cute?

876
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,451
Jack?

877
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:53,794
Welcome home, Harvey.
I hope you're hungry.

878
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,256
I just know how to cook one
thing, but I make it good.

879
01:00:58,501 --> 01:00:59,866
Come.

880
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:01,767
Jack,
did you break in?

881
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,274
No, no, no. I asked the little
boy downstairs to let me in.

882
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:06,535
Danny?
Yeah.

883
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:09,339
He wouldn't let me,
so I came in this way.

884
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,207
You know, your friends aren't
very nice to me, Harvey.

885
01:01:13,282 --> 01:01:14,943
I have a Town Hall
meeting tonight.

886
01:01:15,017 --> 01:01:18,953
Sit down. Come, five minutes.
That's it. Come, please.

887
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,016
There you go.

888
01:01:22,992 --> 01:01:25,825
I watched TV here
today, all day.

889
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:27,726
<i>I saw All My Children.</i>

890
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:32,461
And they killed Margo. But I
knew it was going to happen.

891
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:37,334
You know, they always try and
trick you but it never works.

892
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,305
You always
see it coming.

893
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:45,507
What? Killing the blonde?
Yeah, I'm good with that.

894
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:51,944
Jack.
What?

895
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:53,950
If I make you a key,

896
01:01:55,224 --> 01:01:57,454
will you promise never
to break in again?

897
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:00,595
That's right.

898
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:15,568
Is it your will that Charles should
be baptized in the faith of the church

899
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,510
which we have all
professed with you?

900
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,104
It is.
It is.

901
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:26,216
Charles, I baptize you
in the name of the Father

902
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:29,656
and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit.

903
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:39,428
God, the father of our Lord Jesus
Christ has freed you from sin...

904
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:41,766
I'm proposing
a citywide ordinance

905
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:44,635
which would ensure that any
person who already has a job

906
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:47,540
cannot be fired on the
basis of sexual orientation.

907
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:51,503
I don't think my constituents
would favor that, Harvey.

908
01:02:54,283 --> 01:02:56,979
Is there anyone else here
from the board today, Dan?

909
01:02:57,887 --> 01:03:00,151
You're the only one
who showed, I think.

910
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:01,348
Were you
christened here?

911
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:03,949
I was. Right here, same parish.

912
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:07,052
My grandma immigrated here when
this was an Irish Catholic city,

913
01:03:07,129 --> 01:03:08,824
the City of Saint Francis.

914
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,191
But a lot's changed here
since then, you know.

915
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,792
You're more like one
of us now, an outsider.

916
01:03:14,403 --> 01:03:17,270
You're not like most
homosexuals, are you, Harvey?

917
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:20,642
Do you know a lot
of homosexuals, Dan?

918
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:27,305
Hey, where do you stand
on the Psychiatric Center

919
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:29,715
that the city's been
pushing into my district?

920
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:32,345
Well, I'd have
to study it...

921
01:03:32,421 --> 01:03:36,790
It was a key piece on my platform.
Getting it out of my district.

922
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:39,123
It only attracts arsonists, rapists,
that sort of thing, you know.

923
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:40,492
A campaign promise.

924
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:42,292
A big one.
Sure.

925
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:48,428
What do you say we watch out for each
other's interests? I would really like that.

926
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:50,631
I'd like that too, Dan.
Good.

927
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:53,605
Sorry, hon, we just
slipped into some shop talk.

928
01:03:53,676 --> 01:03:55,803
The Gay Rights Ordinance.
My fault.

929
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:58,476
Seems like an inappropriate
subject, don't you think?

930
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:00,947
Oh, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

931
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:06,481
Hello. Oh, oh, but you had
such a beautiful christening.

932
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,614
Supervisors Silver and
Lau are asking you to vote

933
01:04:08,691 --> 01:04:10,682
to keep this Psychiatric
Center in Dan's district.

934
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,593
It'll go down six to five
if you vote to get rid of it.

935
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:15,096
It's a youth
campus, Harvey.

936
01:04:15,164 --> 01:04:17,394
And these are kids that would
be displaced from families.

937
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:19,627
I can't just dump Dan. He's
got nothing going for him.

938
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:20,828
No friends...

939
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:24,304
Oh, God, oh, God! Here we go,
here we go. Harvey to the rescue.

940
01:04:24,373 --> 01:04:26,671
Isn't it enough that we
have to put up with Jack?

941
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:29,677
All right, lay off. He
registered 120 voters last week.

942
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:31,178
Okay, so do any
of your volunteers,

943
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,442
but you don't go and
make them all first lady.

944
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:36,212
Harvey, what does
Dan White do for you?

945
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:38,310
Really, politically.

946
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:42,085
He intrigues me.
I think he may be one of us.

947
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:43,318
No, no.

948
01:04:43,392 --> 01:04:45,053
It's just a theory.

949
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:46,594
You just
think he's cute.

950
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:49,893
No, no. I know what it's
like to live that life.

951
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:53,696
That lie. I can see it in Dan's
eyes. That fear, the pressure.

952
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:02,277
Good or bad?
Not great.

953
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:07,146
State Senator John Briggs is Anita
Bryant's go-to guy in California for sure.

954
01:05:07,683 --> 01:05:10,709
He filed a petition for
a statewide referendum

955
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,812
to fire all gay teachers
and anyone who supports them.

956
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,683
How many signatures does he
need to get on the ballot?

957
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:21,253
Oh, whatever. He can get them in two
Sundays at church in Orange fucking County.

958
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:27,691
So, this means that
the fight is coming here,

959
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:31,303
where we can do
something about it.

960
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:34,169
<i>The issue in
California is whether school boards</i>

961
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:37,542
<i>should be allowed to fire
teachers who are known homosexuals.</i>

962
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:39,547
<i>The courts have
ruled they cannot.</i>

963
01:05:39,615 --> 01:05:43,608
<i>Boards must prove a teacher's
homosexuality adversely affects children</i>

964
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:45,984
<i>and makes them unfit
for the classroom.</i>

965
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:48,546
<i>State Senator John Briggs
wants to change that.</i>

966
01:05:48,624 --> 01:05:54,119
My proposition promises to protect our
children from these gay perverts and...

967
01:05:55,798 --> 01:05:59,598
These gay perverts and pedophiles
who recruit our children

968
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:02,967
to participate in their
deviant lifestyle,

969
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:06,064
including the ones who do
it in our public schools.

970
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:10,306
The time has come
for us to root them out.

971
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:13,744
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

972
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:15,113
I'm sorry, sir, what?

973
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,345
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

974
01:06:17,419 --> 01:06:20,445
Sir, my bill has procedures
for identifying homosexuals.

975
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,321
Oh, yeah, how? Will you be
sucking them off, Briggs?

976
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:26,691
Excuse me. You know what,
you can argue with me,

977
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,454
you cannot
argue with God.

978
01:06:35,404 --> 01:06:36,996
Harvey, I can't believe it.

979
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:40,371
No, he wants my job. You
want my job, you prick!

980
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:43,570
<i>Sir, you were here when
State Senator Briggs was on the steps.</i>

981
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:45,045
<i>What do you
think about that?</i>

982
01:06:45,114 --> 01:06:49,210
<i>Well, I think what you saw, you saw some
very committed opposition to his proposition.</i>

983
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:51,515
<i>And I think that's
only going to continue.</i>

984
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:54,215
<i>People have very emotional
reactions to this.</i>

985
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,848
<i>This is their lives
that are on the line.</i>

986
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:57,984
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

987
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,756
<i>Well, look what
happened in Germany.</i>

988
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:04,459
<i>I mean, Anita Bryant has already said that
the Jews and Muslims are going to hell.</i>

989
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,967
<i>So, you know she
has a shopping list.</i>

990
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:10,062
<i>And we are not going to let the
John Briggs' or the Anita Bryants</i>

991
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:12,107
<i>legislate bigotry
in this state.</i>

992
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,975
Hello, Harvey,
running late?

993
01:07:19,048 --> 01:07:21,414
Your boyfriend
is in the closet.

994
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,814
Excuse me, David.

995
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:26,218
The Latino has locked himself
in the closet upstairs.

996
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:28,051
Harvey, Harvey,
Phil Burton is here.

997
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,182
He's likely the next
Speaker of the House

998
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:33,626
and a very important ally
against Proposition 6.

999
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:35,687
So, please,
no scenes, all right?

1000
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,059
You're right. I was late by 20 minutes.

1001
01:07:41,136 --> 01:07:42,194
So come on out, Jack.

1002
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:46,105
Who were you with? Scott? Or with
a new boy you were trying to save?

1003
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:48,973
I was at work. Come on out, sweet pea.

1004
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:50,705
You embarrassed me,
Harvey.

1005
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,680
I didn't know anyone down
there and they're bad people.

1006
01:07:55,317 --> 01:07:57,547
I just want to go, okay?

1007
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,315
Then you should go home.

1008
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:03,514
No, I want to stay.
I want to stay here.

1009
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:06,960
So, you go away, okay?
Go away!

1010
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:14,894
The Briggs initiative is polling
at 75% for approval statewide.

1011
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:18,303
80% in other polls. Some even
have us losing San Francisco.

1012
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,899
We deceive people into
thinking we can beat this,

1013
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:23,274
we'll have riots and only
increase the backlash.

1014
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:24,778
That's a good point, David.

1015
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:28,214
Maybe we should just roll over and make
it easier for Briggs to fuck us in the ass.

1016
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,514
We're taking this very
seriously in my office.

1017
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:33,646
We want to send one of these to every
home in California and that takes money.

1018
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:36,190
"Proposition 6 is
an affront to human rights.

1019
01:08:36,258 --> 01:08:40,456
"An invasion of the state into the
private lives of California citizens. ' '

1020
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:43,696
Without a single mention of the
word gay on the entire flyer.

1021
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:45,290
By design, Harvey.

1022
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:47,267
Corey Wares is an out
gay teacher... Rick...

1023
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:50,100
With the heat bearing down
on your movement right now,

1024
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:53,335
we feel it's best to dodge the gay
bullet. Go for the human rights angle.

1025
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:57,140
People need to know who it
is that's being affected.

1026
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:59,806
You need at least one
old queer on this flyer.

1027
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:01,782
Excuse me, yeah. Maybe you
should volunteer for that, David.

1028
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,341
This is shit. This is
shit and masturbation.

1029
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,321
It's just a coward's response
to a dangerous threat.

1030
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:18,499
Come on, Jack.
It's time to go.

1031
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,960
Get everyone
together at your place.

1032
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:23,869
I want young people, I want
women, I want fresh heads.

1033
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:27,670
Get organizers and fighters,
not politicians. Come on, Jack.

1034
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:30,303
What about S-C-O-T-T?

1035
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:32,239
Yeah.

1036
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,310
Jack, come on.

1037
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:35,941
We have to
fight the machine.

1038
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:38,486
They don't want to change,
they want to stay in the past.

1039
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:40,181
Stop and be
realistic about it.

1040
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:44,214
Realistic? We're not interested in
staying in the closet, losing Prop 6.

1041
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,727
We're all on the same side,
man, we're on the same side.

1042
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:51,361
Hey, is anybody gonna pay the
pizza guy or we're just gonna stare?

1043
01:09:51,433 --> 01:09:53,060
How could
we not stare?

1044
01:09:54,603 --> 01:09:56,230
Here, put out your hand.

1045
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,966
You are shameless.
You are shameless.

1046
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:03,238
I mean, I'm proud of you
but you are hysterical.

1047
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,301
Hey.

1048
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:13,014
We're going to
convince the 90%

1049
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:16,487
to give a shit
about us 10%.

1050
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:19,652
We have to let them
know who we are.

1051
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:24,027
Everybody has to come out.

1052
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:26,966
Across the entire state,
no matter where they live.

1053
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,994
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1054
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:32,507
If we're going to beat Prop 6,
we tell all of them to come out.

1055
01:10:32,574 --> 01:10:36,670
Every gay lawyer, teacher,
doctor, dog catcher.

1056
01:10:36,745 --> 01:10:38,770
We have to
leave the ghetto.

1057
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:43,807
We have to let all those people out
there know that they know one of us.

1058
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:46,116
And if somebody doesn't want
to step out of the closet,

1059
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:48,156
we open the door for them.

1060
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:49,383
Jesus.

1061
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,790
The whole state isn't
San Francisco, Harvey.

1062
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,122
Clearly, Scott.

1063
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:54,787
Harvey, that could
be really, really dangerous.

1064
01:10:54,863 --> 01:10:57,093
I mean, there's such a
thing as a right to privacy.

1065
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,690
Privacy.

1066
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,759
In this movement,
at this time,

1067
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:06,035
I'm not saying this as a
supervisor, privacy is the enemy.

1068
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:12,075
And if you want real political
power, if that's what you want,

1069
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,741
try telling the truth
for a change.

1070
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,751
All right? Starting here.

1071
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:19,879
If there's anyone in
this room, right now,

1072
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:22,823
who hasn't told
their families,

1073
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:25,223
their friends,
their employers,

1074
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:27,794
do it now.

1075
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,862
My folks know already.

1076
01:11:32,801 --> 01:11:34,826
My dad doesn't know yet.

1077
01:11:39,074 --> 01:11:41,201
They vote for us
two to one.

1078
01:11:41,944 --> 01:11:44,310
If they know,
they know one of us.

1079
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:57,152
As much as I'm sure
you'd all like to watch,

1080
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,524
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1081
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:06,333
Cleve, could you show Dick where there's
a phone where he could speak in private?

1082
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:09,529
There's
one in the bedroom.

1083
01:12:24,486 --> 01:12:29,685
I just found myself clawing over
him, literally running to get him.

1084
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:31,589
Oh, good night.
Good night.

1085
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,252
<i>Ciao, gang.
Sleep tight.</i>

1086
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:36,024
I thought
you got out of politics.

1087
01:12:36,098 --> 01:12:38,896
Politics.
Not the movement.

1088
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:41,235
What the hell
was that in there?

1089
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,861
The movement needs people to be upfront.

1090
01:12:42,938 --> 01:12:44,769
Why were you
fighting me in there?

1091
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,799
Those are kids in there. You're
asking them to lose their families.

1092
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:52,574
If their families don't
love them for who they are,

1093
01:12:52,648 --> 01:12:54,980
who they really are, then
they should lose them.

1094
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,813
That's fucking insane.

1095
01:12:56,885 --> 01:12:59,285
You were the biggest
closet case in New York.

1096
01:12:59,354 --> 01:13:01,879
You asked me and all your
boyfriends to keep our traps shut.

1097
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:03,515
I mean, you're being the hypocrite.

1098
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:07,221
My parents are gone. My brother
knew. I'm sure they knew.

1099
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:12,467
How many times did I have
to listen to calls to Mom,

1100
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,593
where you
denied my existence?

1101
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,833
And you want to be normal like
anybody. More than anybody.

1102
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,772
Who's he?
You live together?

1103
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,505
Someone I'm seeing.

1104
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,444
Keeps me out of
trouble, out of the bars.

1105
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,780
I miss you.

1106
01:13:33,589 --> 01:13:35,022
Harvey,

1107
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:37,758
what's that about?

1108
01:13:37,826 --> 01:13:39,726
Harvey.

1109
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:42,387
He needs me.

1110
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:56,107
If there is an air of dishonesty
with this board and its members,

1111
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:57,372
that is repugnant...

1112
01:13:57,446 --> 01:14:00,438
I have told no lies today or
to Supervisor White in the past.

1113
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:01,948
Supervisor Milk,
you will come to order.

1114
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:04,611
I would like it
noted that I never promised

1115
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:06,517
to back moving any
mental health centers.

1116
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:10,649
And that with great respect to Supervisor
White, I would like his remarks stricken.

1117
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:14,958
Duly noted. We will take a 10 minute
recess before recording the vote.

1118
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:18,756
Thank you, Harvey.

1119
01:14:19,868 --> 01:14:23,429
Can I have a moment with
Harvey? Alone, please, Carol?

1120
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:31,444
Why? Why are you
turning on me like this?

1121
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:33,447
At the last minute?
What did I do?

1122
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,607
I never
got the details.

1123
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:37,208
Dan, if you want me to help
you draft another version of it

1124
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:41,723
that doesn't shanghai every troubled
kid in your area, I'll be happy to.

1125
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:46,557
Harvey, I can't go back to my family,
to my folks, to my district without this.

1126
01:14:46,628 --> 01:14:48,619
Don't do this. Well, I have
a lot of pressure on me.

1127
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,255
So, you're just
stringing me along

1128
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,799
and then you're just gonna throw
me to the wolves, is that it?

1129
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,027
Dan, you only need one more vote.

1130
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:55,797
You've got five other supervisors
you can convince besides me.

1131
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,863
I'm gonna vote against your queer law
and I'm gonna get Quentin against it, too.

1132
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:01,568
Oh, it's gonna pass anyway and you
can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan.

1133
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:05,135
I gave you a chance, Harvey, okay?
I gave you a chance and you blew it!

1134
01:15:06,915 --> 01:15:08,439
You blew it.

1135
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:15,818
<i>The city council in
St. Paul, Minnesota</i>

1136
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,325
<i>passed a law guaranteeing,
among other things,</i>

1137
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:21,521
<i>equal rights in housing,
employment and education,</i>

1138
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:23,791
<i>regardless of
sexual preference.</i>

1139
01:15:23,865 --> 01:15:26,333
<i>Now, voters in that city have
made their disapproval clear.</i>

1140
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:30,770
<i>Homosexuality is a question facing
the voters of Eugene, Oregon tomorrow.</i>

1141
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:33,501
<i>A referendum to repeal
gay rights protection.</i>

1142
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:39,040
So, while we were fighting
Proposition 6 and Briggs in California,

1143
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:42,343
I needed to put
a show on the road.

1144
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:46,418
And our next stop,
Wichita, Kansas.

1145
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:50,151
<i>Voters of Wichita, Kansas
have overwhelmingly repealed</i>

1146
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:52,386
<i>a city law
protecting homosexuals</i>

1147
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:54,952
<i>against discrimination
in jobs and housing.</i>

1148
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,294
<i>Only two hours
after the polls closed,</i>

1149
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:01,700
<i>the church organization that started the
repeal action was celebrating victory.</i>

1150
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:07,772
Hey, Lawrence, it's Cleve.

1151
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:09,105
Hey, we're losing Wichita.

1152
01:16:09,177 --> 01:16:12,374
So rally tonight sundown
at Market and Castro, okay?

1153
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:13,778
Okay, bye.

1154
01:16:16,084 --> 01:16:17,073
Hello?

1155
01:16:28,597 --> 01:16:32,499
Jerry. Hey,
we're losing Wichita...

1156
01:16:42,677 --> 01:16:44,167
They're moving.
I don't know where.

1157
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:46,646
Did Jim call the press? You
get out there with your camera.

1158
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:49,684
Press is covered. But we
don't have a permit to march.

1159
01:16:51,052 --> 01:16:52,178
Hurry up.

1160
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:03,497
When I got Coors beer out of the
bars, the union boys gave me this.

1161
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:05,556
I want you
to take it now.

1162
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:07,826
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1163
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:09,564
You're an activist now,
you're gonna march them.

1164
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:11,970
I want you to march them right up
to the front doors of City Hall.

1165
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,634
When things start
to look really bad,

1166
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:18,873
the city's first gay supervisor
will come out and play peacemaker.

1167
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:21,911
Do it with me.

1168
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:32,319
<i>Hello.</i>

1169
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:35,861
<i>Forty years ago, tonight,</i>

1170
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:41,335
<i>the gay citizens of Germany found
out they no longer had civil rights.</i>

1171
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:48,869
<i>Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
of Wichita will also awaken</i>

1172
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:52,971
<i>to find that they too
have lost their civil rights!</i>

1173
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:57,485
<i>You have whistles. You use
them when we have been attacked.</i>

1174
01:17:57,953 --> 01:17:59,648
<i>Tonight we have been attacked.</i>

1175
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:01,916
Come on, the crowd
is leaving without us!

1176
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,480
Shit!

1177
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:31,316
Get the press
to the marquee.

1178
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:33,854
<i>Move left! Move left!</i>

1179
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,981
What are you doing? What are
you doing? Where's Harvey?

1180
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:38,491
We're shutting down traffic,
both directions.

1181
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,754
<i>Cameras are rolling.</i>

1182
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:41,989
Okay, disconnect
the power arm!

1183
01:18:58,313 --> 01:19:04,943
<i>Civil rights or civil
war! Gay rights now!</i>

1184
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:19,594
Civil rights
or civil war! Gay rights now!

1185
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:26,798
Civil rights or civil war!
Gay rights now!

1186
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,137
<i>Anita!</i>

1187
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:32,339
<i>Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!</i>

1188
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:34,279
Anita, you're a liar!

1189
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:41,216
Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!

1190
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:10,083
Okay, okay!

1191
01:20:11,486 --> 01:20:14,683
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I'm here to recruit you.</i>

1192
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:20,090
They're calling it
a successful mediation.

1193
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:24,325
You're a goddamn hero. Fuck,
we came this close to a riot.

1194
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:27,935
Next time
put down the note cards.

1195
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:31,962
You got to keep talking into that bullhorn
and tell them what they're feeling.

1196
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,066
Oh, you're just jealous
it wasn't you out there.

1197
01:20:35,143 --> 01:20:37,611
We're losing
Proposition 6 by 60%,

1198
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,647
and you're over there
celebrating a riot.

1199
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,682
What we need is exposure.

1200
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,274
If we're gonna
beat this thing,

1201
01:20:43,351 --> 01:20:45,581
we got to get Briggs
to acknowledge it.

1202
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:49,090
Every paper's calling
Prop 6 the main event now.

1203
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:52,718
We lose this, we'll have
anti-gay laws in all 50 states,

1204
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:55,058
and Briggs won't answer our
calls for a public debate.

1205
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:56,791
He's trying
to ignore us to death.

1206
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:58,992
We need
something populist.

1207
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:03,226
What's the number one
problem in this city?

1208
01:21:03,304 --> 01:21:05,795
The fucking piss
smell in the tenderloin.

1209
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:07,034
Close.

1210
01:21:07,108 --> 01:21:08,473
Dog shit.

1211
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:12,071
If you clean up the dog shit in
this town, you're the next mayor.

1212
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:14,172
<i>Supervisor Milk
took to the grassy lawn</i>

1213
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,877
<i>at Duboce Park this afternoon
to publicize the new law.</i>

1214
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:19,920
Dog mess is a hazard and on
top of that, it's disgusting.

1215
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:24,015
So under the new ordinance, all dog
owners who don't clean up their mess

1216
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,184
will be fined.

1217
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,195
<i>Milk put his foot down to
emphasize that the city intends to enforce,</i>

1218
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,026
<i>and you guessed it.</i>

1219
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:33,898
<i>In Supervisor Milk's words,
"This really is the bottom line. "</i>

1220
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:35,229
<i>Aye.</i>

1221
01:21:35,303 --> 01:21:38,397
Lau, aye.
Supervisor Hutch?

1222
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:39,531
Aye.

1223
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,906
Hutch, aye.
Supervisor White?

1224
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:45,471
No.

1225
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:48,948
White, no.
Supervisor Silver?

1226
01:21:49,017 --> 01:21:50,348
Aye.

1227
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:53,581
Silver, aye.
Supervisor Milk?

1228
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:55,781
Aye.

1229
01:21:55,857 --> 01:21:57,757
Milk, aye.

1230
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:02,024
Madam President, I have
ten ayes and one no.

1231
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,827
The San Francisco
Gay Rights Ordinance

1232
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:09,666
sponsored by Supervisors
Milk and Silver is passed.

1233
01:22:17,278 --> 01:22:19,712
I can't get my stories on page
ten, you're getting page one?

1234
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:21,874
Doggy-doo is a
real issue, George.

1235
01:22:23,785 --> 01:22:27,346
A powder blue pen to sign the
city's first gay rights law.

1236
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:33,453
I don't do this enough, taking
swift and unambiguous action

1237
01:22:33,528 --> 01:22:36,053
on a substantive
move for civil rights.

1238
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:40,098
Congratulations.

1239
01:22:40,668 --> 01:22:42,533
George, we need your help with Briggs.

1240
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:46,005
The gay community will have your
back on every issue from now on.

1241
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:47,803
We hope you'll have ours.

1242
01:22:56,284 --> 01:22:58,479
What are you
working on, Dan?

1243
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,355
If you have something
to discuss, Harvey,

1244
01:23:01,422 --> 01:23:04,653
you can have your aide make
an appointment with my aide.

1245
01:23:04,726 --> 01:23:07,752
Dan, I know you're upset
about the psychiatric center.

1246
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:11,665
What else do you
have coming up?

1247
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:13,462
Now you need
something from me.

1248
01:23:14,602 --> 01:23:18,265
What do you want, me to support the
queers against Prop 6, is that it?

1249
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:20,830
We prefer the term gay, Dan.

1250
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:24,868
Just as I'm sure you prefer the
term Irish-American instead of mick.

1251
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:29,075
Harvey, a society can't
exist without the family.

1252
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:30,845
We're not against that.
You're not?

1253
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:32,682
What, can two men reproduce?

1254
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:33,743
No.

1255
01:23:33,822 --> 01:23:35,585
But God knows
we keep trying.

1256
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:40,758
This isn't you, Dan.

1257
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:43,491
It's like you're
channeling Anita and Briggs.

1258
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,997
We got to be able to work
together on something.

1259
01:23:48,803 --> 01:23:50,430
Okay, Milk,

1260
01:23:51,372 --> 01:23:54,364
introduce an initiative
for supervisor pay raises.

1261
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:56,672
Dan, we both have elections
coming up. We can't do that.

1262
01:23:56,744 --> 01:23:58,871
No, you asked for something.

1263
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:03,213
Introduce pay raises, 'cause I can't
take care of my family on our salaries.

1264
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:06,082
You don't have that
problem, do you?

1265
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:17,931
<i>Senator John Briggs

What's wrong, taco?

1276
01:25:28,002 --> 01:25:30,095
It's just that
Cleve and Anne,

1277
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:32,696
they tried to cut me
out of your table, baby.

1278
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,504
I'm so sick of them.
You should fire them.

1279
01:25:36,811 --> 01:25:39,006
I'll take it
under consideration.

1280
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,514
Would you go
get us some cake?

1281
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:42,810
Cake?
Yeah.

1282
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:44,476
Whatever you want.

1283
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:51,924
Don't let Cesar Chavez
hear you calling him taco.

1284
01:25:51,993 --> 01:25:55,759
He's getting much better. He's
enrolling in classes on Monday, I hope.

1285
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:57,923
You know, I remember
when your birthdays were

1286
01:25:57,999 --> 01:25:59,990
a lot less lavish and
a little more intimate.

1287
01:26:00,068 --> 01:26:01,592
Who invited you? Anne?

1288
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:04,900
No, my boyfriend.
I'm his plus one.

1289
01:26:06,574 --> 01:26:09,202
Well, congratulations. It
was a very hard ticket to get.

1290
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:12,940
Congratulations to you. Looks like
you're part of the machine now.

1291
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:16,774
By the way,
you can do better.

1292
01:26:17,485 --> 01:26:19,976
When I come home to Jack, I
don't have to talk politics,

1293
01:26:20,054 --> 01:26:23,387
I don't have to talk intelligently.
I don't have to talk at all.

1294
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:27,827
And besides, where's an ugly old man like
me gonna find a handsome young man like that?

1295
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:31,092
You're not that old
and you look handsome.

1296
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:36,362
Happy 48. Looks like you're gonna
make it to 50 after all, Mr. Milk.

1297
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:43,807
Harvey!

1298
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:56,314
Harvey, Harvey!

01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:58,291
Is your birthday party
over?

1300
01:26:58,359 --> 01:27:00,589
Well, it's just
winding down. Hi.

1301
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:03,789
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
missed your birthday party.

1302
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:06,299
No, it's no problem.
It's good to see you, Dan.

1303
01:27:06,367 --> 01:27:08,597
I'm sorry. It's good
to see you too, Harvey.

1304
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:14,475
Oh, I wanted to ask
you about the dog poop.

1305
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:16,009
Yeah.

1306
01:27:16,077 --> 01:27:18,875
That's good.
It's a really good one.

1307
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,470
It's a good one.

1308
01:27:20,548 --> 01:27:22,482
Hey, I got you
a little something.

1309
01:27:23,117 --> 01:27:24,311
You didn't have to.

1310
01:27:24,385 --> 01:27:25,852
I knew you were
going to say that.

1311
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,649
Why do people
always say that?

1312
01:27:27,722 --> 01:27:30,657
"You didn't have to. ' '
I mean, of course, right?

1313
01:27:30,725 --> 01:27:32,590
But that's what
they always say.

1314
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,958
They always say
things like that.

1315
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:36,621
Always.

1316
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,099
Are you okay, Dan?

1317
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,258
Yeah.

1318
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:42,859
Are you okay, Harvey?

1319
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:45,736
Are we okay?
Okay.

1320
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,275
I've learned a lot from
watching you. I doubt that.

1321
01:27:48,342 --> 01:27:52,005
No, I have. I've realized
you just gotta get out there.

1322
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,981
You gotta be noticed, 'cause
that's how it all works.

1323
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:58,485
But you have an issue.
See, that's your advantage.

1324
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:02,321
That's an advantage.

1325
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,154
Dan,
it's more than an issue.

1326
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:07,419
What?
I...

1327
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:12,933
Dan, I have had four
relationships in my life.

1328
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,197
And three of them have tried to
commit suicide. And that's my fault,

1329
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:19,671
because I kept them hidden and quiet,
because I was closeted and weak.

1330
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,300
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.

1331
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:24,367
You do?
Mmm-hmm.

1332
01:28:24,445 --> 01:28:29,212
This is not just jobs or issues,
this is our lives we're fighting for.

1333
01:28:29,283 --> 01:28:30,978
Okay?
All right.

1334
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:33,111
Okay, Dan... I've learned
a lot from you, Harvey.

1335
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:34,449
I'm getting back
to my party now.

1336
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:36,490
I'm going to get my
picture in the papers, too.

1337
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:40,288
Why are you even here? Why did
you just show up from somewhere?

1338
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:43,091
I've got my own issues.
Okay.

1339
01:28:43,164 --> 01:28:45,223
I've got my own issues.
Thank you.

1340
01:28:45,299 --> 01:28:47,665
"Thank you. ' ' Whatever.

1341
01:28:47,735 --> 01:28:53,367
I don't even know who you are. You just
showed up out of nowhere, Latino man.

1342

01:31:31,365 --> 01:31:37,770
<i>"Give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to be free. "</i>

1367
01:31:40,207 --> 01:31:43,404
<i>In the Declaration of
Independence it is written,</i>

1368
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:51,350
<i>"All men are created equal and endowed
with certain inalienable rights. "</i>

1369
01:31:58,893 --> 01:32:01,828
<i>So, for Mr. Briggs,</i>

1370
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:06,397
<i>And Mrs. Bryant,</i>

1371
01:32:09,303 --> 01:32:12,067
<i>And all the bigots
out there,</i>

1372
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:16,201
<i>no matter how hard you try,</i>

1373
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:21,544
<i>you can never erase those words
from the Declaration of Independence!</i>

1374
01:32:21,615 --> 01:32:26,882
<i>No matter how hard you try,
you can never chip those words</i>

1375
01:32:26,954 --> 01:32:30,048
<i>from the base of
the Statue of Liberty!</i>

1376
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:33,616
<i>That is where America is!</i>

1377
01:32:33,694 --> 01:32:35,924
<i>Love it or leave it!</i>

1378
01:32:45,873 --> 01:32:48,967
Okay, the mayor says Briggs is on his way
here and that he could intercept him for us.

1379
01:32:49,043 --> 01:32:50,806
We could get him face to face.
Go get the press.

1380
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:52,209
All right.

1381
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:58,012
Well, I see naked men walking
around, naked women walking around,

1382
01:32:58,085 --> 01:33:02,419
which doesn't bother me as far as
my personal standards of nudity,

1383
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:07,359
but it's not proper. It wouldn't be allowed
for any other parade in San Francisco,

1384
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:09,794
and it should not be
allowed for the Gay Parade.

1385
01:33:48,302 --> 01:33:50,361
I have a right to be at
this parade, Mr. Mayor.

1386
01:33:50,438 --> 01:33:52,372
I'm afraid it's not in the
interest of your safety,

1387
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,568
or my public's safety to let
you into these parade grounds.

1388
01:33:57,211 --> 01:34:00,806
I'm Harvey Milk. It's an
honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

1389
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,242
Yeah, no, I'm aware.

1390
01:34:04,318 --> 01:34:07,913
You know, it's sad, Mr. Milk, that
you're afraid to fight this out in public.

1391
01:34:07,988 --> 01:34:09,080
Oh, that's not true.

1392
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:10,919
I'd very much like to have
a public debate with you.

1393
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,221
I'm very interested in the
details of your argument.

1394
01:34:13,294 --> 01:34:16,593
Oh, well, you know,
you know the details.

1395
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:20,566
I mean, just look at the votes across
this nation. The public is with me.

1396
01:34:20,634 --> 01:34:22,033
They are today.

1397
01:34:22,102 --> 01:34:24,332
Which is why
with my city's mayor

1398
01:34:24,405 --> 01:34:26,805
and the San Francisco
press as my witnesses,

1399
01:34:26,874 --> 01:34:29,434
I'd like to challenge
you to a public debate.

1400
01:34:34,715 --> 01:34:36,307
Oh, I think
that's a yes.

1401
01:34:38,786 --> 01:34:43,348
<i>You know, Mr. Milk, we don't allow
people who practice bestiality</i>

1402
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:45,892
<i>To teach our children,
and... Excuse me,</i>

1403
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,190
<i>and the reason we don't
is because it is illegal.</i>

1404
01:34:48,262 --> 01:34:51,356
<i>It is not illegal to be a
homosexual in California.</i>

1405
01:34:51,432 --> 01:34:53,366
<i>And your law goes
even further.</i>

1406
01:34:54,201 --> 01:34:57,864
<i>Any school employee who even
supports a gay person will be fired.</i>

1407
01:34:57,938 --> 01:35:00,736
<i>Well, that's true. But gay people
don't have any children of their own.</i>

1408
01:35:00,808 --> 01:35:03,368
<i>And if they don't recruit our
children, they'd all just die away.</i>

1409
01:35:04,678 --> 01:35:07,272
<i>You know? And that's why they're all
so interested in becoming teachers,</i>

1410
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:11,307
<i>because they want to encourage
our children to join them.</i>

1411
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:14,879
<i>And how do you
teach homosexuality?</i>

1412
01:35:14,955 --> 01:35:15,979
<i>It's like French?</i>

1413
01:35:18,926 --> 01:35:21,292
<i>I was born of
heterosexual parents,</i>

1414
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:23,455
<i>taught by
heterosexual teachers</i>

1415
01:35:23,531 --> 01:35:26,159
<i>in a fiercely
heterosexual society.</i>

1416
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:28,360
<i>So why then
am I homosexual?</i>

1417
01:35:28,435 --> 01:35:30,130
<i>And no offense meant,</i>

1418
01:35:30,204 --> 01:35:33,071
<i>but if it were true that
children mimicked their teachers,</i>

1419
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,301
<i>we'd have a hell of a lot
more nuns running around.</i>

1420
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,812
We were really, genuinely
frightened by Proposition 6.

1421
01:35:49,056 --> 01:35:53,254
And with Anita and Briggs gaining
strength, we were very pessimistic.

1422
01:35:54,295 --> 01:35:57,321
We didn't think that there was
any chance that we could beat it.

1423
01:35:57,398 --> 01:35:59,866
But what we did hope for

1424
01:35:59,934 --> 01:36:02,266
<i>is that we could
organize enough,</i>

1425
01:36:02,903 --> 01:36:06,805
<i>so that when we did lose,
all hell would break loose.</i>

1426
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:10,002
We're still losing 60-30. We got
to take this show on the road.

1427
01:36:10,077 --> 01:36:11,476
Put out a press release.

1428
01:36:11,545 --> 01:36:14,605
Call Briggs' office, tell him he
can pick the audience, the town.

1429
01:36:14,682 --> 01:36:16,616
I'll tell my supporters
to stay away.

1430
01:36:16,684 --> 01:36:20,245
Harvey, his audiences are
intensely devout. You'll get killed.

1431
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:22,922
Get me Orange County.

1432
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,982
<i>In your statements here and all
these newspapers and tonight,</i>

1433
01:36:27,061 --> 01:36:29,859
<i>you say that child
molestation is not an issue.</i>

1434
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:31,625
<i>If it's not an issue,</i>

1435
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:35,191
<i>why do you put out literature
that hammers it home?</i>

1436
01:36:35,269 --> 01:36:38,705
<i>Why do you play on
this myth and fear?</i>

1437
01:36:38,772 --> 01:36:41,206
<i>Same thing with VD, Harvey,
we put out publications...</i>

1438
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:42,435
<i>This is campaign
literature.</i>

1439
01:36:42,509 --> 01:36:46,104
<i>Well, we put out publications
about VD so you can avoid it.</i>

1440
01:36:52,953 --> 01:36:56,582
<i>You yourself had said that there's more
molestation in the heterosexual group,</i>

1441
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:59,854
<i>So why not get rid of
the heterosexual teachers?</i>

1442
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:03,590
<i>We are not talking about
homosex... About child molestation.</i>

1443
01:37:03,664 --> 01:37:09,432
<i>Nearly... The fact is, nearly 95
percent of the people are heterosexual,</i>

1444
01:37:09,503 --> 01:37:12,802
<i>so, if we took the heterosexuals
out and the homosexuals out,</i>

1445
01:37:12,873 --> 01:37:14,534
<i>you know what,
we'd have no teachers.</i>

1446
01:37:14,608 --> 01:37:15,836
<i>We'd have no teachers,
no more molestation.</i>

1447
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:18,139
<i>So you're saying that the
percentage of the population</i>

1448
01:37:18,212 --> 01:37:19,474
<i>is equal to the percentage
of child molestation?</i>

1449
01:37:19,546 --> 01:37:21,514
<i>No, no, no,
I'm not saying that, no.</i>

1450
01:37:21,582 --> 01:37:23,049
<i>That's what
you just said.</i>

1451
01:37:23,117 --> 01:37:25,381
<i>No, no, no. I'm not saying that at
all. I am saying that we can't prevent</i>

1452
01:37:25,452 --> 01:37:28,046
<i>child molestation, so
let's just cut our odds down</i>

1453
01:37:28,122 --> 01:37:31,922
<i>by taking out the homosexuals and
keeping in the heterosexual groups.</i>

1454
01:37:34,762 --> 01:37:38,493
<i>Sir, in your drive
for personal power,</i>

1455
01:37:38,565 --> 01:37:41,159
<i>how many careers are you
willing to see destroyed?</i>

1456
01:37:41,235 --> 01:37:46,366
<i>How many lives, in your lust for power,
will you destroy and when will it stop?</i>

1457
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,348
Jack, what is it?

1458
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:03,686
<i>Nothing. Just
wondering when you'll be home.</i>

1459
01:38:03,757 --> 01:38:07,215
You just had them pull me out of my big
vote on the dog shit ordinance for this?

1460
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:09,194
What, do you do
this on purpose?

1461
01:38:09,263 --> 01:38:11,288
Fuck, Harvey,
it's poop, okay?

1462
01:38:11,365 --> 01:38:14,061
I just hope I'm more
important than poop.

1463
01:38:14,134 --> 01:38:18,503
<i>Look, it's... I just... I don't
know what time I'll be home.</i>

1464
01:38:18,572 --> 01:38:20,039
6:00 or 6:15.

1465
01:38:20,107 --> 01:38:21,597
<i>Okay.
Okay?</i>

1466
01:38:21,675 --> 01:38:23,404
I'm all right.
I'll see you then.

1467
01:38:23,477 --> 01:38:24,967
<i>Okay.
6/15, then.</i>

1468
01:38:28,682 --> 01:38:30,741
Dan, how's the baby?

1469
01:38:30,818 --> 01:38:33,218
You didn't bring up
supervisor pay raises?

1470
01:38:33,287 --> 01:38:36,415
In fact, I heard that you
plan to publicly oppose them.

1471
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,458
Well, I heard that you planned
to vote against them, too.

1472
01:38:38,525 --> 01:38:39,924
Were you setting me up?

1473
01:38:39,993 --> 01:38:42,826
It's not a good time for
me, politically speaking.

1474
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:46,695
Dan, there's a vote on the
Police Desegregation Settlement.

1475
01:38:46,767 --> 01:38:49,065
You give me that and I'll
consider backing pay raises.

1476
01:38:49,136 --> 01:38:51,229
I don't trade votes.

1477
01:38:51,305 --> 01:38:52,795
Unlike you,
the way I was raised,

1478
01:38:52,873 --> 01:38:55,808
we believe in right and
wrong. Moral and immoral.

1479
01:38:55,876 --> 01:38:58,470
Black skin and white
in the police department.

1480
01:38:58,545 --> 01:39:02,242
Dan, even Ronald Reagan
is opposed to Proposition 6.

1481
01:39:02,316 --> 01:39:04,216
You're looking more
and more out of touch.

1482
01:39:04,284 --> 01:39:07,014
Okay, if I come out against Prop 6,
it's only going to be for the invasion

1483
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:08,611
of state's rights issue,
that's it.

1484
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:10,884
And the potential witch hunt
against you straight people.

1485
01:39:13,694 --> 01:39:17,255
You can't humiliate
me, okay?

1486
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:20,957
You will not demean me.

1487
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:29,442
Harvey, we're doing the final
vote. We need to get you back.

1488
01:39:43,991 --> 01:39:45,151
Jack?

1489
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:49,989
Jack?

1490
01:39:57,404 --> 01:39:58,530
Jack?

1491
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,553
Oh!

1492
01:40:14,621 --> 01:40:16,646
No, Jack. Jack, no!

1493
01:40:16,723 --> 01:40:19,954
No, no, no. Jack, no.

1494
01:40:22,629 --> 01:40:23,618
Jack!

1495
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:28,661
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no!

1496
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,308
Harvey,

1497
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:39,177
look at me.

1498
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,045
Hey, look at me.

1499
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:45,277
You did everything
that you could.

1500
01:40:48,355 --> 01:40:50,016
No, I didn't.

1501
01:40:51,491 --> 01:40:53,391
What more could
you have done?

1502
01:40:55,495 --> 01:41:00,558
I could have come back
at 6:00 instead of 6:15.

1503
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:05,037
Shh.

1504
01:41:07,574 --> 01:41:10,634
Jack was gone. I didn't
have any time to mourn.

1505
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:12,372
There was no choice.

1506
01:41:13,046 --> 01:41:16,413
I had to keep on...
Keep on fighting.

1507
01:41:18,452 --> 01:41:20,317
<i>Most
California political leaders,</i>

1508
01:41:20,387 --> 01:41:23,447
<i>from Governor Jerry Brown to
former Governor Ronald Reagan,</i>

1509
01:41:23,523 --> 01:41:27,152
<i>say there are already enough laws
on the books to protect children.</i>

1510
01:41:27,227 --> 01:41:29,627
<i>If you allow one,
just one human being</i>

1511
01:41:29,696 --> 01:41:32,995
<i>to be allowed to have his
rights taken away from him,</i>

1512
01:41:33,066 --> 01:41:34,897
<i>as a human being
then, pal,</i>

1513
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:37,300
<i>you don't have any right when
they come to take away your rights!</i>

1514
01:41:37,371 --> 01:41:39,965
<i>You do what you want in
the privacy of your own home.</i>

1515
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,338
<i>But don't tell me I got
to accept it in mine.</i>

1516
01:41:50,284 --> 01:41:52,616
San Bernadino is coming in.
Not good.

1517
01:41:52,686 --> 01:41:54,017
Of course not.
How not good?

1518
01:41:54,087 --> 01:41:56,487
60% for Briggs.
Same in Fresno.

1519
01:41:56,556 --> 01:41:58,547
Oh, dear God,
Lotus Blossom.

1520
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:01,753
Imperial is
69% for so far.

1521
01:42:01,828 --> 01:42:03,261
Put it on the board.

1522
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:06,561
<i>I love homosexuals,
if you can believe that.</i>

1523
01:42:06,633 --> 01:42:08,328
<i>I love them enough
to tell them the truth.</i>

1524
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:12,304
<i>I think that if it were passed, it
would be just what some people would need</i>

1525
01:42:12,372 --> 01:42:14,101
<i>to conduct a very
severe witch hunt.</i>

1526
01:42:14,174 --> 01:42:17,575
<i>What I ask, everybody to
vote against Proposition 6.</i>

1527
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:27,816
The whole world is watching. This is
San Francisco we're losing. You ready?

1528
01:42:28,622 --> 01:42:31,785
I can have 15,000
people here in an hour,

1529
01:42:31,858 --> 01:42:34,224
but there's gonna be
riots if this thing passes.

1530
01:42:34,294 --> 01:42:36,125
There goddamn
well better be.

1531
01:42:37,297 --> 01:42:38,889
What are you telling me?

1532
01:42:38,966 --> 01:42:41,400
I can't say this because
I'm a public official,

1533
01:42:41,468 --> 01:42:45,666
but if this thing passes,
fight the hell back.

1534
01:42:45,739 --> 01:42:48,299
<i>It was fundamentalist
Christians who helped Briggs</i>

1535
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:51,936
<i>gather most of the signatures to
put Proposition 6 on today's ballot.</i>

1536
01:42:52,012 --> 01:42:54,242
<i>The Christian community
had never been involved</i>

1537
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:56,544
<i>in any political
controversial issue.</i>

1538
01:42:56,616 --> 01:42:59,414
<i>And they're not only involved,
but they're committed.</i>

1539
01:42:59,486 --> 01:43:02,011
<i>They've not only been working very hard,
but they're going to come out and vote today.</i>

1540
01:43:02,089 --> 01:43:04,649
<i>"Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself. "</i>

1541
01:43:04,725 --> 01:43:07,353
<i>And I would like to know
how you, Senator Briggs,</i>

1542
01:43:07,427 --> 01:43:12,490
<i>believe that Proposition 6 will help
children learn how to accept people</i>

1543
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:14,056
<i>who are different
from themselves.</i>

1544
01:43:14,134 --> 01:43:16,329
Harvey,
Don Amador from LA.

1545
01:43:17,938 --> 01:43:19,166
Not a good time, Don.

1546
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:21,969
<i>No, sir, this is Paul.
Don just gave me the phone.</i>

1547
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,168
Paul who?

1548
01:43:23,243 --> 01:43:25,108
<i>You spoke to me on the
phone a year or so ago.</i>

1549
01:43:25,178 --> 01:43:28,375
<i>I'm in a wheelchair.
I'm from Minnesota.</i>

1550
01:43:28,448 --> 01:43:30,848
I thought you were
a goner, Paul.

1551
01:43:31,585 --> 01:43:34,748
When I saw that you
won the supervisor seat,

1552
01:43:34,821 --> 01:43:37,289
I got a friend to
put me on a bus to LA.

1553
01:43:37,357 --> 01:43:39,291
<i>Who do you know
in Los Angeles?</i>

1554
01:43:40,527 --> 01:43:42,119
Nobody.

1555
01:43:42,195 --> 01:43:43,787
That's the...

1556
01:43:45,966 --> 01:43:47,729
I just didn't
want to die anymore.

1557
01:43:47,801 --> 01:43:50,031
<i>I met your friend Don
down here.</i>

1558
01:43:50,103 --> 01:43:52,867
<i>I turned 18 and I voted
today against Prop 6.</i>

1559
01:43:52,939 --> 01:43:55,237
<i>I don't think I'd be alive
right now if it weren't for you.</i>

1560
01:43:55,308 --> 01:43:57,242
No, you did that all by yourself, Paul.

1561
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:59,870
<i>Don wanted me to congratulate
you on what he says</i>

1562
01:43:59,946 --> 01:44:03,575
<i>looks like a big win for us
tonight. Congratulations, Mr. Milk.</i>

1563
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:10,552
Yeah, I know,
it's incredible.

1564
01:44:10,624 --> 01:44:13,991
All the precincts have reported
we've won 65% in LA County.

1565
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:15,722
<i>It's huge, Harvey.</i>

1566
01:44:15,796 --> 01:44:17,627
I got to go, Don.

1567
01:44:17,697 --> 01:44:22,566
We just took LA County by
65%. Put it up! Put it up!

1568
01:44:32,946 --> 01:44:34,140
Okay, okay.

1569
01:44:34,214 --> 01:44:36,045
What, Jim? Jim, what? Okay, okay!

1570
01:44:36,116 --> 01:44:38,414
The polls were way off.
Briggs is going down by 2 to 1.

1571
01:44:38,485 --> 01:44:41,818
The only place it's going to pass in
San Francisco is Dan White's district.

1572
01:44:42,989 --> 01:44:45,389
Somebody, cover up
Lady Liberty!

1573
01:44:45,459 --> 01:44:48,223
The cameras are
on the way here.

1574
01:45:31,938 --> 01:45:36,136
<i>Tonight, it's become clear
to everyone out there</i>

1575
01:45:36,209 --> 01:45:39,235
<i>that they do know one of us,
and now that they do,</i>

1576
01:45:39,312 --> 01:45:41,337
<i>they can see that
we're not sick.</i>

1577
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:44,617
<i>They can feel that
we are not wrong.</i>

1578
01:45:45,519 --> 01:45:50,081
<i>And they know that there must
be, that there should be a place</i>

1579
01:45:50,157 --> 01:45:54,890
<i>for us in this great
country, in this world.</i>

1580
01:46:01,234 --> 01:46:06,262
A message of hope has been
sent to all those young people,

1581
01:46:06,339 --> 01:46:09,968
to all of those who've been
afraid by this wave of hate,

1582
01:46:10,043 --> 01:46:14,207
to all of those who have lost
their homes, lost their hometowns.

1583
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:20,015
Tonight, we are clear that
there is a place for us!

1584
01:46:20,086 --> 01:46:23,385
My brothers and sisters,
we can come home again!

1585
01:46:47,814 --> 01:46:49,873
Oh, good morning, Dan.

1586
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:53,078
Morning, Harvey,
I just resigned.

1587
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:57,483
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll
be the next President of the Board.

1588
01:47:00,927 --> 01:47:04,226
Hey, Dan.
Just got word.

1589
01:47:04,297 --> 01:47:06,595
Can we talk to you for a minute?

1590
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:08,429
Yeah, sure.

1591
01:47:08,501 --> 01:47:10,901
The association
meeting room.

1592
01:47:25,452 --> 01:47:28,580
<i>Well, now it starts all over
again, because this morning,</i>

1593
01:47:28,655 --> 01:47:33,854
<i>former Supervisor Dan White says he wants
to be called supervisor one more time.</i>

1594
01:47:33,927 --> 01:47:38,387
He gets dragged into this closed
door meeting at Police Association.

1595
01:47:38,465 --> 01:47:39,989
Suddenly
he wants his job back.

1596
01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,658
I mean, who knows what they
might have said to him in there.

1597
01:47:41,735 --> 01:47:43,669
Or what they may
have promised him.

1598
01:47:43,737 --> 01:47:45,227
Or worse yet, if they
had threatened him.

1599
01:47:45,305 --> 01:47:47,796
A man has the right to change
his mind. Give me some peace.

1600
01:47:47,874 --> 01:47:51,401
Dan White has been the vote on the
board that has stood in our way.

1601
01:47:51,478 --> 01:47:53,241
The vote.
I get it, Harvey.

1602
01:47:53,313 --> 01:47:55,178
I've been lobbied all week.
Enough.

1603
01:47:56,449 --> 01:47:59,646
Let me remind you of something,
you're up for re-election.

1604
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:02,984
If you reappoint Dan White, you will
lose the gay vote. They listen to me.

1605
01:48:03,056 --> 01:48:05,217
You will not be
elected dog catcher.

1606
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:10,493
I'll make
my decision on Monday.

1607
01:48:11,331 --> 01:48:13,629
You know who you
sounded like just now?

1608
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,635
Boss Tweed
or Mayor Daly.

1609
01:48:18,805 --> 01:48:20,397
I like that.

1610
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:25,669
A homosexual with power.

1611
01:48:27,047 --> 01:48:28,844
That's scary.

1612
01:49:37,984 --> 01:49:39,645
Hello.

1613
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:41,448
Yes, hold on, please.

1614
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:44,957
Thank you.

1615
01:49:46,025 --> 01:49:47,424
Yes, this is Dan White.

1616
01:49:47,494 --> 01:49:50,054
<i>Hi, Mr. White, this is
Barbara Taylor from KCBS.</i>

1617
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:51,222
Mmm-hmm.

1618
01:49:51,297 --> 01:49:53,197
<i>I'm interested
in your reaction.</i>

1619
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:55,996
<i>I've received information
from the mayor's office</i>

1620
01:49:56,069 --> 01:49:59,163
<i>that you're not
getting your job back.</i>

1621
01:50:01,174 --> 01:50:04,075
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about that.

1622
01:50:21,795 --> 01:50:23,023
Hello?

1623
01:50:23,096 --> 01:50:24,723
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

1624
01:50:26,699 --> 01:50:29,031
Harvey?
Are you all right?

1625
01:50:29,702 --> 01:50:33,968
I went to the opera tonight.
Guess who I went with.

1626
01:50:35,041 --> 01:50:36,133
<i>Who?</i>

1627
01:50:36,209 --> 01:50:38,734
Bidu Sayao herself.

1628
01:50:38,812 --> 01:50:42,213
She was my first Puccini.
The crowd went wild.

1629
01:50:42,282 --> 01:50:46,582
I felt like I was young
again, being at my first opera.

1630
01:50:58,965 --> 01:51:01,832
Maybe you should tell me the
next time you go to the opera.

1631
01:51:02,936 --> 01:51:04,335
Really?

1632
01:51:04,404 --> 01:51:06,702
<i>Yeah. I'd go with you.</i>

1633
01:51:09,776 --> 01:51:11,300
I'd like that.

1634
01:51:27,427 --> 01:51:29,657
Look outside,
the sun's coming up.

1635
01:51:29,729 --> 01:51:31,720
<i>Okay, hang on.</i>

1636
01:51:56,523 --> 01:51:58,081
Hey, wait a minute.

1637
01:51:58,157 --> 01:52:00,284
My aide was supposed to come down here

1638
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,385
and let me in the side door,
but she never showed up.

1639
01:52:02,462 --> 01:52:04,930
And you are? I'm Dan
White, City Supervisor.

1640
01:52:13,373 --> 01:52:14,499
Harvey,

1641
01:52:16,442 --> 01:52:18,910
I want you to know
that I am proud of you.

1642
01:53:00,653 --> 01:53:02,553
I don't wanna miss this.

1643
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,317
<i>Miss what?</i>

1644
01:53:08,027 --> 01:53:09,085
This.

1645
01:53:13,666 --> 01:53:16,965
Is he here? Can I see
the mayor for a moment?

1646
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:20,696
Just a minute,
I'll see if he's available.

1647
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:25,475
Sir, Dan White
is here to see you.

1648
01:53:29,816 --> 01:53:31,841
So, who are they gonna replace Dan with?

1649
01:53:31,918 --> 01:53:35,183
That goddamn lefty
liberal, Don Horanzy?

1650
01:53:35,254 --> 01:53:37,085
That'll really
shake up the board.

1651
01:53:37,156 --> 01:53:39,886
All I know is that we're
getting a new supervisor today.

1652
01:53:39,959 --> 01:53:43,122
If Dan shows up,
just avoid him.

1653
01:53:43,196 --> 01:53:45,664
We don't need a scene
today, do we, Harvey?

1654
01:53:46,265 --> 01:53:47,755
God forbid, Dianne.

1655
01:53:50,236 --> 01:53:53,034
Mr. White,
the mayor will see you now.

1656
01:53:56,275 --> 01:53:57,606
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1657
01:53:57,677 --> 01:54:00,009
Dan, come on in.

1658
01:54:02,415 --> 01:54:04,246
It's not something that
I wanna calm down about.

1659
01:54:04,317 --> 01:54:06,080
You can't take
this away from me.

1660
01:54:06,152 --> 01:54:09,053
Dan, look,
you made a decision.

1661
01:54:09,122 --> 01:54:11,113
You know,
you made the decision.

1662
01:54:13,059 --> 01:54:16,654
The issue is what's fair to the
people of your district, Dan.

1663
01:54:16,729 --> 01:54:20,859
Now, look, take some time
off. Spend it with your family.

1664
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:11,445
Tell President Carter we're coming
after him next, this time next year.

1665
01:55:11,517 --> 01:55:12,609
Hi, Dianne.

1666
01:55:12,685 --> 01:55:14,880
We're marching
to Washington D.C.

1667
01:55:17,824 --> 01:55:20,088
Hey, can I see you in
my office for a minute?

1668
01:55:22,462 --> 01:55:25,920
Sure. I'll be back.
Yeah.

1669
01:55:44,417 --> 01:55:45,645
No.

1670
01:56:27,493 --> 01:56:29,654
Well,
you know what I think?

1671
01:56:29,729 --> 01:56:32,459
I think you need
to find a new scene.

1672
01:56:32,532 --> 01:56:34,124
And some new friends.

1673
01:56:36,769 --> 01:56:38,600
I need a change.

1674
01:56:41,974 --> 01:56:44,067
You're 40 now.
Oh.

1675
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:54,045
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

1676
01:56:55,922 --> 01:57:00,518
Keep eating all that cake, you're gonna
be a fat-ass by the time you're 50.

1677
01:57:00,593 --> 01:57:03,562
No, I'll never make it to 50.

1678
01:57:49,075 --> 01:57:50,667
Where is everyone?

1679
01:57:51,677 --> 01:57:53,406
Doesn't anyone
give a damn?

1680
01:57:54,347 --> 01:57:57,180
Cleve's getting some people
together in the Castro.

1681
01:58:04,624 --> 01:58:09,186
Last week I got a phone call
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1682
01:58:10,296 --> 01:58:16,132
The voice was very young,
and the person said, "Thanks. ' '

1683
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:22,203
<i>You've got to elect gay people
so that the young child</i>

1684
01:58:22,808 --> 01:58:25,936
<i>and the thousands upon
thousands just like him</i>

1685
01:58:26,846 --> 01:58:29,508
<i>will have hope
for a better life.</i>

1686
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:33,050
<i>Hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

1687
01:58:50,536 --> 01:58:52,003
<i>I ask this,</i>

1688
01:58:53,539 --> 01:58:56,474
<i>that if there be
an assassination,</i>

1689
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:04,310
<i>I would want five, ten,
a hundred, a thousand to rise.</i>

1690
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:13,389
<i>If a bullet should enter my brain,
let it destroy every closet door.</i>

1691
01:59:14,927 --> 01:59:22,129
<i>I ask for the movement to continue
because it's not about personal gain,</i>

1692
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:25,364
<i>and it's not about ego
and it's not about power.</i>

1693
01:59:26,138 --> 01:59:28,663
<i>It's about the
"us's" out there.</i>

1694
01:59:30,042 --> 01:59:33,808
<i>Not just the gays but
the blacks and the Asians</i>

1695
01:59:33,879 --> 01:59:35,779
<i>and the seniors
and the disabled.</i>

1696
01:59:35,848 --> 01:59:37,076
<i>The "us's. "</i>

1697
01:59:40,753 --> 01:59:44,120
<i>Without hope,
the "us's" give up.</i>

1698
01:59:46,325 --> 01:59:50,421
<i>And I know you can't
live on hope alone.</i>

1699
01:59:50,496 --> 01:59:55,195
<i>But without hope,
life is not worth living.</i>

1700
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:58,969
<i>So you,</i>

1701
01:59:59,939 --> 02:00:01,497
<i>and you,</i>

1702
02:00:02,008 --> 02:00:03,373
<i>and you,</i>

1703
02:00:03,743 --> 02:00:05,768
you got to give them hope.

1704
02:00:07,613 --> 02:00:10,104
You got to give them hope.
