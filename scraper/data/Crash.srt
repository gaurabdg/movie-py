1
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,695
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,331
What?

3
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,544
Any real city, you walk,
you know?

4
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,481
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,576
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,588
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,962
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,023
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,232
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,365
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,306
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,311
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,211
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,375
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:43,444
And somewhere in there, one of us lost
our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,956
And I'm gonna
go look for it.

17
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,792
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,831
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,923
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,729
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,895
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,905
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,668
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:07,474
- She "blake" too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,277
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,182
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,120
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

28
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,750
- Ma'am!
- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.

29
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,555
Officer, can you please
write in your report

30
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,630
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver!

31
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,928
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

32
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,139
All right. You've got
to calm down.

33
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,879
- Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

34
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,290
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

35
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,159
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

36
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,630
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

37
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,497
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

38
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,231
Yeah, me too.

39
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,830
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

40
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,115
Hey, Bob.

41
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,326
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

42
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,112
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

43
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,808
What do you want?

44
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,750
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

45
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,155
- Is that the closest you can come to English?
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.

46
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,693
- Oh, God, here we go.
- I have right like you.

47
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,660
- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't!

48
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,990
- Andy, get him outta here now!
- Go wait in the car.

49
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,066
Now. Get out!

50
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,803
- You're an ignorant man!
- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country

51
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,965
and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,067
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

53
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,839
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

54
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,846
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

55
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,438
Okay.

56
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,988
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

57
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,388
And I am really hoping
for the money.

58
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,458
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

59
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,535
We got a lot of kinds.

60
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,002
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

61
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,665
flat nose, hollowpoints,
wide cutters,

62
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,210
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

63
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,077
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

64
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,281
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

65
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,118
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

66
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,928
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

67
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,973
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

68
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,941
You don't drink coffee!
And I didn't want any.

69
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,810
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

70
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,974
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

71
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,052
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

72
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,383
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

73
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,480
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

74
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,059
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,128
You tell me. When was
the last time you met one

76
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,595
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

77
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,928
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

78
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,365
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

79
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,166
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

80
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,265
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

81
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,810
How much did you leave?

82
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,880
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

83
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,384
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

84
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,454
I'm seriously starting to think that
you're jealous of Karen.

85
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,753
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

86
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,387
Okay, no more phone calls. As a matter of fact,
you can hold the battery.

87
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,328
Okay?

88
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,132
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

89
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,932
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

90
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,098
- You see that?
- She's cold.

91
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,507
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

92
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,739
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

93
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,306
You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better-lit
part of this city right now.

94
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,318
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

95
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,116
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

96
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,657
and her reaction
is blind fear?

97
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,250
Look at us, dog. Are we dressed
like gangbangers?

98
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,694
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

99
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,700
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

100
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,761
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

101
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,569
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

102
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,237
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

103
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,541
'Cause we got guns?

104
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,445
You could be right.

105
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,750
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

106
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,585
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

107
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,924
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

108
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,556
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

109
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,198
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

110
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,607
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

111
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,577
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dog.

112
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,547
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

113
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,780
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

114
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,354
Why the hell do you do that?

115
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,323
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

116
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,591
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

117
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,398
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

118
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,201
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop
coming off shift.

119
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,242
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

120
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,709
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

121
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,474
I got the Mercedes.

122
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,211
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

123
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,880
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

124
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,787
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

125
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,757
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

126
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,988
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

127
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,621
Shot back in self-defense.

128
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,930
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

129
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,868
Find me a witness.

130
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,817
That is a nice gun.

131
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:34,484
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

132
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,458
And that's not Cindy.

133
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,360
That is a William Lewis.

134
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,434
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

135
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,842
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

136
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,583
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

137
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,591
Thank you.

138
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,701
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

139
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,601
I need to talk to you
for a second.

140
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,966
You just give me a minute,
all right?

141
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,604
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,615
Yes, honey?

143
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,684
I want the locks changed
again in the morning.

144
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,752
You want...

145
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,515
Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

146
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,887
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

147
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,894
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,293
It's okay. Just go to bed.

149
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,891
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

150
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,233
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

151
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,772
Is okay I go home now?

152
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,672
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

153
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,836
- You're welcome, no problem. Good night.
- Good night.

154
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,412
We'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,644
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

156
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,049
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

157
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,349
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

158
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,754
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

159
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,555
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

160
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,096
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our key

161
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,792
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

162
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,799
We've had a tough night.

163
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,565
- It'd be best if you went...
- And wait for them to break in?

164
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,130
I just had a gun
pointed in my face.

165
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,368
You lower your voice!

166
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,207
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

167
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,838
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

168
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,476
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

169
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,180
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

170
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,553
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

171
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,856
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

172
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,456
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

173
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,623
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

174
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,698
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

175
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,165
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

176
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,465
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

177
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,368
Fuck!

178
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,838
Why did these guys
have to be black?

179
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:41,379
I mean, why?
No matter how we spin this,

180
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,540
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

181
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,815
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

182
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,482
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

183
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:57,153
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

184
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,231
Bruce?

185
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,060
The firefighter.

186
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,102
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

187
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,229
He's Iraqi.

188
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,502
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

189
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,409
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

190
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,505
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

191
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,746
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

192
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,015
Give yourself a raise!

193
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,518
It's been good
doing business with you.

194
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,996
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

195
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,728
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

196
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,703
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

197
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,708
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

198
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,112
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

199
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,582
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

200
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:58,020
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

201
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,182
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

202
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,157
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

203
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,162
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

204
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,061
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

205
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,862
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

206
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,517
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

207
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,316
Vehicle is described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

208
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,951
California plates,
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

209
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,497
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

210
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,068
That's not it. That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

211
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,910
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

212
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,419
They were doin' something!

213
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,032
Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,396
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

215
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,736
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

216
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,003
No problem.

217
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,013
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

218
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,982
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

219
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,353
How are you tonight, Officer?

220
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,324
Excellent.

221
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,596
Here you go.

222
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,226
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

223
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,410
Let's do it again right now.

224
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,540
Step outta the car, please, sir.

225
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,347
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

226
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,684
Then we shouldn't have
a problem.

227
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,452
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

228
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,390
No, it's okay.

229
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,020
It's fine.

230
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,800
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

231
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,902
That's good. Right there.

232
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,973
Look at me.

233
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,012
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

234
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,277
Touch your nose with the index finger
of your left hand.

235
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,249
I told you he doesn't drink.

236
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,020
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

237
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,687
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

238
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,060
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

239
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,466
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

240
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,539
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

241
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,437
Wait. We're only a block
away from our house.

242
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,874
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

243
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,105
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

244
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,978
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

245
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,347
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

246
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,613
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

247
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,211
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

248
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,191
- Put your hands...
- And you keep your filthy hands off me!

249
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,955
You motherfucking pig!

250
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,554
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

251
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,429
Of course you know that.

252
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,300
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

253
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,203
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

254
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,037
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

255
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,203
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

256
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,611
Put your legs open.

257
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,649
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

258
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,086
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

259
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,681
You'd be surprised
some of the places I've found weapons.

260
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,760
He's clean.

261
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,629
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

262
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,294
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

263
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,564
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

264
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,768
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

265
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:51,374
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

266
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,415
You say you're a block
from home.

267
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,819
We could use our discretion

268
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,984
and let you go with a warning,

269
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,530
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

270
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,100
What do you think
we should do, sir?

271
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,807
Look, we're sorry, and

272
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:26,441
we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

273
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,786
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

274
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,952
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

275
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,292
Yeah.

276
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,595
All right.

277
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,534
You can go.

278
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,045
You folks drive safe now, huh?

279
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,683
Let's go, Tommy.

280
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,728
It won't close.

281
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,023
I can do that.

282
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,794
Dad, you couldn't even
get it open.

283
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,802
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

284
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,566
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

285
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,438
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

286
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,035
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

287
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,637
Farhad, it won't close.

288
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,787
Dorri, you should be at work.

289
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,168
Who are you calling?

290
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,897
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

291
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,998
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

292
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:36,012
Do you have any idea how that felt? To have
that pig's hands all over me?

293
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,981
And you just stood there!

294
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,177
And then you apologized
to him?

295
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,187
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

296
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,781
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

297
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,590
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

298
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,564
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

299
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,465
than get your name
in the paper.

300
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,765
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

301
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,705
that's exactly
what I was worried about.

302
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,801
Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good
friends at the studio

303
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,780
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

304
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,442
You need to calm down
right now.

305
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:19,388
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

306
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,460
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

307
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,859
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

308
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,731
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

309
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,566
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

310
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,369
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

311
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,570
At least I wasn't watching it with
the rest of the equestrian team.

312
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,840
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

313
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:46,042
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

314
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,018
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

315
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,850
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

316
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:56,485
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

317
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,998
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

318
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,760
You know, fuck you!

319
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,069
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

320
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,914
How's it goin'

321
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,754
Okay.

322
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,987
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

323
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,893
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

324
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,967
There's no such thing
as monsters.

325
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,663
- Ah, that's a good thing.
- I heard a bang.

326
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,364
Like a truck bang?

327
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,566
Like a gun.

328
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,650
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

329
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,849
And there's not
too many guns around here.

330
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,324
How far can bullets go?

331
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,395
They go pretty far.

332
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,396
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

333
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,056
What if they don't?

334
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,933
You thinking about that bullet that came
through your window?

335
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,332
'Cause we never
did find it, did we?

336
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,970
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

337
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,074
Hmm. You think it was that same
bullet that you heard tonight?

338
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,449
You think
we should move again?

339
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,524
I like it here.

340
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,584
Me too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

341
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:11,684
Oh, hold on.

342
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,286
What?

343
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,491
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

344
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,864
What?

345
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,499
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

346
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,097
Tell me.

347
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,643
Okay.

348
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,612
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

349
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,081
- Right.
- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.

350
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,675
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

351
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,086
Okay.

352
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:45,458
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

353
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,588
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

354
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,793
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

355
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,268
She was flying?

356
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,999
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

357
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,735
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

358
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,811
So she said, "I'll prove it."

359
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,506
So she reaches
into her backpack.

360
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,947
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

361
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,647
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

362
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,985
You know what
impenetrable means?

363
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,956
It means that nothing
can go through it.

364
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,324
No bullets. Nothing.

365
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,229
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

366
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:26,292
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

367
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,373
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

368
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,410
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

369
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,274
And I forgot.

370
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,870
Can I touch it?

371
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,040
Sure, go ahead.

372
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,445
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

373
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,424
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

374
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,155
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

375
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,061
No, not anymore.

376
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,101
So what do you think?
You want it?

377
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,173
Okay, let's get outta here.

378
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,144
Okay.

379
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,492
Put your head up.

380
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,134
Okay. Is that too tight?

381
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,733
Do you feel anything at all?

382
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,244
Good. Then
it's just right.

383
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,011
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

384
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,886
No, you leave it on
all the time.

385
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:59,362
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

386
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,591
Okay?

387
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,964
Okay.

388
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,505
Okay.
Good night, sweetie.

389
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,402
Good night.

390
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,918
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

391
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,046
How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop
music of the oppressor?

392
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,422
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

393
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,963
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

394
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,588
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

395
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,599
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

396
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:14,570
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

397
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,469
And you think there's
a difference, don't you? Huh?

398
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:20,670
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

399
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,941
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

400
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,573
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

401
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,948
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

402
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,214
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

403
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,348
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

404
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,824
Gonna string 'em up good

405
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,724
These brothers were speaking out good,
and people were listening!

406
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,524
Then they'll be dead

407
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,622
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

408
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,463
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

409
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,696
"Let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

410
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,602
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

411
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,641
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

412
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,971
End of problem."

413
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,179
What the fuck
was that, dog?

414
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,864
- Holy shit!
- What?

415
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,438
Man, we done ran over
a Chinaman.

416
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,370
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

417
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,634
What part don't you understand?

418
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,575
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

419
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,780
- Help me.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

420
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,582
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

421
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,715
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

422
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,690
Oh, really? No shit!

423
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,854
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

424
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,932
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

425
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,227
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

426
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,236
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

427
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,999
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

428
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,200
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

429
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,542
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

430
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,175
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

431
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,877
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

432
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,785
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

433
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,619
Then what your ass
gonna do, huh?

434
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,321
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

435
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,331
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

436
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,800
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

437
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,967
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

438
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,511
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

439
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,410
He's been on the force
for a long time.

440
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,676
Seventeen years.

441
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,014
And I do have
to work here, sir.

442
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,520
So you don't mind that there's
a racist prick on the force.

443
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,591
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

444
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,490
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

445
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,426
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

446
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,294
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

447
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,335
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

448
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,597
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

449
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,105
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

450
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,973
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

451
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,980
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

452
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,347
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

453
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,387
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

454
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,389
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

455
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,358
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

456
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:28,228
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

457
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,425
You wanna know what I heard?

458
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,928
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

459
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,233
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

460
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,104
Not him. You. You have
uncontrollable flatulence.

461
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,873
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

462
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,608
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

463
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,651
I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

464
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,519
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

465
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,786
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

466
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,885
And how easily
that can be taken away.

467
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,124
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

468
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:07,068
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

469
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,073
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

470
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,473
of a personal nature.

471
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,816
Fuck.

472
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,342
Excuse me.

473
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,043
Excuse me. Sir?

474
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,086
You finished?

475
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,315
I replaced the lock. But you got
a real problem with that door.

476
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,891
You fix the lock?

477
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:06,191
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

478
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,698
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, listen to me.

479
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,894
What you need
is a new door.

480
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,564
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

481
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,141
Okay. How much?

482
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:22,110
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

483
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,343
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

484
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,577
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

485
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,018
Then go and fix
the fucking lock, you cheater.

486
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,886
You... You know what?

487
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,518
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

488
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,028
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

489
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,225
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

490
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,894
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

491
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,370
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

492
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,704
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

493
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,540
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

494
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,376
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

495
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,451
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

496
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,420
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

497
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:15,623
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

498
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,600
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

499
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,467
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

500
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,938
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

501
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,271
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

502
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,311
You watch the Discovery Channel?

503
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,813
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

504
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,511
Every night there is a show with somebody
shining a blue light

505
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,818
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

506
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,486
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

507
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,053
The next thing they show is some
stupid redneck in handcuffs

508
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,363
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

509
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,496
Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channel

510
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,597
when they break in
to arrest him.

511
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:02,941
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

512
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,823
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

513
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,187
No.

514
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,092
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

515
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,460
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

516
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,934
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

517
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,801
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

518
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,775
Don't.

519
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,973
Graham Waters.

520
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:42,348
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

521
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm not gonna go
looking for him.

522
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,190
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

523
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,958
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

524
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,500
Okay, where were we?

525
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,069
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

526
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,367
Oh, shit!

527
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:05,596
Come on.

528
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:10,665
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

529
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:13,041
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

530
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:16,877
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

531
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:20,441
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

532
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:22,851
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

533
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:26,356
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

534
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:30,520
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

535
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,497
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

536
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,958
Okay. I was raised badly.

537
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,506
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

538
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:44,565
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

539
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:48,807
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

540
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:51,975
Neither one of those is Mexico.

541
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,519
Ah. Then I guess
the big mystery is

542
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,112
who gathered all those remarkably
different cultures together

543
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:01,250
and taught them all how to park
their cars on their lawns?

544
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:31,387
Pop, you okay?

545
00:40:31,491 --> 00:40:34,517
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

546
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:38,792
I'm... Jesus.

547
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:41,389
I'm done now.

548
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,526
Give me a hand.

549
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:47,963
Wait a goddamn minute!

550
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:50,736
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

551
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:56,170
All right. Okay. Okay.

552
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:06,218
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

553
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:08,987
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

554
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,366
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

555
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:35,974
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:42:36,082 --> 00:42:39,017
- They know each other? It's a grudge thing?
- Sir.

557
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:41,746
Not as far as we can tell.

558
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:44,152
You think this is
racially motivated?

559
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:47,590
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

560
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,661
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

561
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:53,755
Waters. Tell him he speaks
to no one but me.

562
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,029
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

563
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:59,036
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

564
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:04,304
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

565
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,779
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

566
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:11,907
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

567
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:14,543
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

568
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:16,622
The man steals
from black people.

569
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:19,054
Only reason black people
steal from their own

570
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:21,786
- is 'cause they terrified of white people.
- Man, please.

571
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:25,728
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

572
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:28,391
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

573
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,901
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

574
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:35,133
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

575
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:38,472
What the fuck did you do to my car?

576
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:49,285
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

577
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:52,357
I turn key to my car,
but nothing.

578
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,392
James wanted
to take this to school.

579
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:57,189
But I don't want the kids
to fight over it.

580
00:43:57,296 --> 00:44:01,062
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

581
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:06,104
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

582
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,000
Si, senora.
No problem.

583
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:12,510
I'm startin' to understand now.

584
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:16,411
By your work, you're settin'
an example for our neighborhood.

585
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:19,006
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

586
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:21,516
Yeah, you laugh, man.

587
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,681
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

588
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:30,218
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

589
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:31,660
Wavin' down the bus.

590
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:34,062
Put your hand down, dog!
Are you outta your mind?

591
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,532
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

592
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,899
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

593
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,939
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

594
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,668
You have no idea, do you?

595
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:47,268
You have no idea why they put them great
big windows on the sides of buses, do you?

596
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,940
- Why?
- One reason only.

597
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:54,349
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

598
00:44:54,453 --> 00:44:55,818
I didn't know that.

599
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:58,890
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

600
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,959
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

601
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,427
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

602
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,862
I love hockey.

603
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:08,558
Cut! Print. Moving on.

604
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:12,865
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

605
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:16,066
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

606
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:19,303
Right on.

607
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:22,779
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

608
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:25,646
Yeah. Listen.
I think we need another take, buddy.

609
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:28,481
That looked pretty terrific, man.

610
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:32,751
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

611
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:34,792
What do you mean?

612
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:38,352
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

613
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:42,230
but have you noticed he's talking
a lot less black lately?

614
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:45,799
No, I haven't noticed that.

615
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:49,671
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed
to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

616
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:52,300
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

617
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:53,742
Wait a minute.

618
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:58,579
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

619
00:45:58,684 --> 00:46:01,710
- Come on!
- Is there a problem, Cam?

620
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:03,413
Excuse me?

621
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:05,888
Is there a problem, Cam?

622
00:46:10,796 --> 00:46:13,321
No, we don't have
a problem.

623
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:16,697
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

624
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:19,396
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

625
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:23,236
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

626
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,379
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

627
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:34,419
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

628
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:39,049
Jamal, um...

629
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:44,893
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

630
00:46:44,997 --> 00:46:47,795
Hold for a minute, please.
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,

631
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,630
but you have a walk-in,
Mr. Ryan.

632
00:46:53,906 --> 00:46:56,636
Send him in.

633
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,040
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

634
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:01,306
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

635
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:03,973
I believe we spoke last night.

636
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:07,382
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

637
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:10,683
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

638
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,314
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

639
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:17,589
This doctor he's been seein' says
he's got a urinary tract infection.

640
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:21,154
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

641
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:23,258
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

642
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,065
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

643
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:28,106
- Really?
- No offense.

644
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:31,699
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

645
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:36,838
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's
welcome to see a doctor outside the network.

646
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:41,352
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

647
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:44,581
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

648
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,319
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

649
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:51,089
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

650
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:54,758
All right.
You know what I can't do?

651
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:57,461
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

652
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,970
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

653
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,801
It's time for you to go.

654
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:05,001
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

655
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,907
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

656
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,071
someone who may have
been given a helping hand,

657
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,979
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

658
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:14,245
Carol, I need security
in my office!

659
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:17,447
You don't like me,
that's fine. I'm a prick.

660
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:20,116
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

661
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,194
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

662
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:24,125
Saved enough to start
his own company.

663
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,198
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

664
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:28,994
Paid 'em equal wages when
no one else was doing that.

665
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:34,095
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

666
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:35,969
Then the city council decides

667
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:39,306
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

668
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:42,175
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

669
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,682
His business, his home,
his wife. Everything!

670
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:49,481
Not once does he blame
your people.

671
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:53,046
I'm not asking you
to help me.

672
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:57,492
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

673
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,928
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

674
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:02,330
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

675
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:04,368
Nothing.

676
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,461
Just a flick of your pen.

677
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,975
Your father sounds like
a good man.

678
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:15,206
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

679
00:49:15,314 --> 00:49:19,774
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

680
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:22,786
- Get him the hell outta my office.
- Prick.

681
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:34,559
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

682
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,157
He say he fix the lock.

683
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,998
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

684
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:41,004
I am not yelling!
I'm upset!

685
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:43,472
Yes... Yes, I am.

686
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:45,202
Mom, are you all right?

687
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:49,577
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

688
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:52,446
Okay?

689
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:54,917
Look what they wrote.

690
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,045
They think we're Arab.

691
00:49:57,156 --> 00:49:59,181
When did Persian
become Arab?

692
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:02,124
I want his name. Yes.

693
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:03,854
Oh, my God.

694
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:06,988
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

695
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:08,498
I'm not giving you
his name, sir.

696
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,366
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

697
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,530
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

698
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,371
Don't hang up! Shit!

699
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,308
Oh, thank God.

700
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:09,193
Mom?

701
00:51:09,294 --> 00:51:11,524
Mom, it's cold.
Come on.

702
00:51:33,752 --> 00:51:36,050
Did you find your brother?

703
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,317
No, Mom.

704
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,327
I was doin' good.

705
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:57,102
I was... I was doin' real good.

706
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:02,677
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

707
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:08,119
It's okay.

708
00:52:19,565 --> 00:52:21,726
Did you find your brother?

709
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:26,402
No, Mom.

710
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:30,264
Tell him to come home.

711
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:37,013
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

712
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,640
Okay, Mom.

713
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:42,242
Okay, baby.

714
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:43,946
Okay.

715
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,015
Okay.

716
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,596
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

717
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:31,195
Internal Affairs called. Found something
in the Mercedes.

718
00:53:33,972 --> 00:53:37,499
That's lunch. One hour.

719
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,497
I tried to call.

720
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:12,100
- Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?
- Yeah.

721
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:18,143
What?

722
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,150
I got scared, Cam.

723
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:25,713
It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.
You know?

724
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:27,815
But not like that.

725
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:31,152
And, yes,
I was a little drunk.

726
00:54:31,263 --> 00:54:35,199
And I was mouthing off.

727
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,495
I'm sorry.

728
00:54:39,605 --> 00:54:41,368
But when that man was putting
his hands on me...

729
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,100
I don't wanna talk about it.

730
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:46,644
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

731
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:51,580
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

732
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:55,814
But I was humiliated!

733
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,082
For you.

734
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:02,718
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

735
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:05,820
Yeah. That's what happened.

736
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,957
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

737
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,830
I ain't doin' it.

738
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:13,461
You gonna walk away
from me?

739
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:16,837
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

740
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:26,612
Mm-hmm. I understand.

741
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:30,655
Thanks.

742
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,692
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

743
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:42,796
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

744
00:55:44,336 --> 00:55:45,860
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

745
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:49,634
They said their man told you

746
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:53,040
to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

747
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:57,345
Are you saying it's his fault?

748
00:55:58,383 --> 00:56:02,786
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering this.

749
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,726
No. This store is all we have.

750
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:34,877
I really am sorry.

751
00:56:57,409 --> 00:56:59,570
What time
you must go to work?

752
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:02,579
Not until tonight.

753
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:04,148
Go home and sleep.

754
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:10,047
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

755
00:57:33,278 --> 00:57:34,404
Hey.

756
00:57:36,148 --> 00:57:39,549
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

757
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:41,846
Yeah, they told me.

758
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:44,751
I just wanted to say,
good luck

759
00:57:44,856 --> 00:57:46,687
and it was good
ridin' with you.

760
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,453
You too.

761
00:57:51,463 --> 00:57:54,728
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

762
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,030
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

763
00:57:58,136 --> 00:58:02,766
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

764
00:58:02,874 --> 00:58:06,810
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

765
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:09,745
You have no idea.

766
00:58:13,218 --> 00:58:16,312
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

767
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:18,252
Ready, amigo.

768
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:31,025
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

769
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:35,800
21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.

770
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:39,707
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

771
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,848
Call it in.

772
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:32,152
Ma'am?

773
01:01:32,257 --> 01:01:34,282
Can you hear me?

774
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:36,827
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

775
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:39,989
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

776
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:47,070
Ma'am, are you hurt?

777
01:01:47,172 --> 01:01:50,232
- Can you move?
- L... I can't breathe.

778
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:56,338
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

779
01:02:03,121 --> 01:02:04,588
It's okay.

780
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,351
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:11,463 --> 01:02:13,363
Okay, I'm gonna get
you out.

782
01:02:17,703 --> 01:02:19,671
No!

783
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:22,831
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

784
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:26,001
Get away.
Stay away from me!

785
01:02:26,111 --> 01:02:29,376
Not you! Not you!

786
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:32,279
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

787
01:02:32,384 --> 01:02:35,979
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'- - I'm tryin' to help you.

788
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:38,613
Fuck you!
Not you!

789
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:41,693
Somebody!
Anybody else!

790
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:45,456
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

791
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:49,056
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

792
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:53,331
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

793
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,744
Okay. Okay.

794
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:03,371
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

795
01:03:03,482 --> 01:03:07,282
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

796
01:03:07,386 --> 01:03:09,411
and that's gasoline there.

797
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:14,322
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

798
01:03:14,426 --> 01:03:16,621
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

799
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:22,496
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

800
01:03:25,704 --> 01:03:27,672
Yeah. Yeah.

801
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:30,735
Thanks.

802
01:03:34,713 --> 01:03:38,479
Is anything broken?

803
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:41,017
L-I don't think so.

804
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,020
Okay. Then that's good.

805
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:46,647
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

806
01:03:46,758 --> 01:03:50,023
Yeah, I'm gonna get
you out. Okay?

807
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:53,461
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

808
01:03:58,837 --> 01:04:01,135
Oh, fuck!

809
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:04,231
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

810
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:09,209
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

811
01:04:09,314 --> 01:04:11,407
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

812
01:04:12,384 --> 01:04:14,011
It's okay, it's okay.

813
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:16,815
It's okay. Okay,
we're gonna get you out.

814
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:19,220
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

815
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:21,815
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

816
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:23,656
Everything's gonna be fine.

817
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:42,843
Ryan!

818
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:20,008
Pull!

819
01:05:33,932 --> 01:05:35,957
It's okay.

820
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,741
It's okay.

821
01:05:47,846 --> 01:05:51,475
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

822
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:54,051
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

823
01:05:54,152 --> 01:05:56,211
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

824
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:58,619
It's cool, it's cool.

825
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:03,051
Here we go. All right,
you're doin' great.

826
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:37,460
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

827
01:06:37,562 --> 01:06:40,292
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none
of us would have jobs.

828
01:06:40,398 --> 01:06:42,662
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

829
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:45,600
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

830
01:06:45,704 --> 01:06:48,832
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

831
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,307
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two
suspicious shootings on his record.

832
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,675
Both black men. Both times he was cleared,
but only just.

833
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,578
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

834
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:02,141
You know any reason why we shouldn't
hang Conklin for this?

835
01:07:02,254 --> 01:07:07,351
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

836
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:13,329
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

837
01:07:13,431 --> 01:07:15,558
Shit!

838
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:20,161
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

839
01:07:20,272 --> 01:07:24,140
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

840
01:07:24,242 --> 01:07:28,076
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

841
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:31,671
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

842
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:35,549
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not
have known the money was in it.

843
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:45,589
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

844
01:07:46,831 --> 01:07:49,891
Latasha Harlins,
Rodney King.

845
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:52,970
- These names ring a bell, Detective?
- Yeah, vaguely.

846
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:58,566
We have attorneys for this slain police officer
camping in our offices.

847
01:07:58,677 --> 01:08:01,407
We have his mother
and a half dozen men of the cloth

848
01:08:01,513 --> 01:08:04,414
who swear that Lewis was one of
the twelve apostles of Christ.

849
01:08:04,516 --> 01:08:05,983
We have two black city councilmen

850
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:09,349
and a congresswoman
who call on the hour, every hour,

851
01:08:09,454 --> 01:08:12,855
demanding to know what the district attorney
intends to do about this.

852
01:08:12,957 --> 01:08:15,983
And you want him to walk
into that press room

853
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:19,154
and tell them all that
the situation is complicated?

854
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:25,836
Give us a minute.

855
01:08:27,472 --> 01:08:29,633
No problem.

856
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:39,343
Who knows about the money?

857
01:08:39,451 --> 01:08:41,476
You gotta be kiddin' me.

858
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:45,454
There are only two people
in this room.

859
01:08:45,557 --> 01:08:48,890
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

860
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:51,484
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

861
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:58,501
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

862
01:08:58,603 --> 01:09:01,071
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't clear
evidence of any wrongdoing.

863
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:04,141
And even if it was, we aren't going to
prosecute a dead man.

864
01:09:04,242 --> 01:09:08,702
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

865
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:11,111
You can do this dance
if you want to,

866
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:14,674
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

867
01:09:14,786 --> 01:09:17,755
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

868
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,657
Fucking black people, huh?

869
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:22,818
What did you just say?

870
01:09:22,927 --> 01:09:24,895
I mean,

871
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:27,521
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

872
01:09:27,632 --> 01:09:30,692
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

873
01:09:30,802 --> 01:09:34,670
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

874
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:36,741
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

875
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:40,902
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

876
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,947
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

877
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:51,213
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth.

878
01:09:51,322 --> 01:09:53,449
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

879
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:56,994
And assholes like Lewis keep feeding
the flames. It's gotta get to you.

880
01:09:57,095 --> 01:10:00,553
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

881
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:02,565
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

882
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:04,601
Oh, please, don't do that.

883
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:07,535
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

884
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:11,598
What do you think those kids need... to make
them believe, to give them hope?

885
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,303
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

886
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:17,347
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

887
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:22,045
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

888
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:26,853
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

889
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:30,826
Rick is quite adamant that his replacement
be a person of color.

890
01:10:30,929 --> 01:10:35,093
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

891
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,863
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

892
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:43,839
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

893
01:10:43,942 --> 01:10:46,410
Actually we were thinking of you.

894
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:49,708
Until we saw that.

895
01:10:49,814 --> 01:10:51,873
It's your brother's file.

896
01:10:51,983 --> 01:10:55,077
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

897
01:10:55,186 --> 01:10:57,916
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

898
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:00,684
Christ, that's a shitty law.

899
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,726
There's a warrant in there.

900
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:07,230
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

901
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:11,966
Fucking black people, huh?

902
01:11:16,307 --> 01:11:20,767
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

903
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:23,177
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

904
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:26,580
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

905
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:30,415
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

906
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:35,255
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

907
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,295
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

908
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:40,591
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

909
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:43,690
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

910
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,099
was enough to get him killed.

911
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:49,605
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

912
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:53,837
Which means we
could get this wrong.

913
01:11:55,713 --> 01:11:58,773
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

914
01:11:58,883 --> 01:12:03,286
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

915
01:12:03,388 --> 01:12:05,788
You're the one closest to all this.

916
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,915
You need to tell us.

917
01:12:11,729 --> 01:12:14,163
What does your gut tell you?

918
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:30,108
So? Graham?

919
01:12:30,214 --> 01:12:32,341
What do I tell 'em?

920
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:36,352
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

921
01:12:42,994 --> 01:12:47,158
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

922
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:50,291
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

923
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:53,063
Okay.

924
01:13:09,687 --> 01:13:11,951
Before I get to why we're here,

925
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:15,992
I know that many of you have heard we had
our car stolen last night.

926
01:13:16,094 --> 01:13:20,463
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

927
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:22,396
But we're okay.

928
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,130
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

929
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:32,835
Now, just after 9.'00 p.m. Last night,
Detective William Lewis,

930
01:13:32,944 --> 01:13:35,572
an eight-year veteran of the force and an
active member of the black community,

931
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,810
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

932
01:14:37,709 --> 01:14:39,540
Get outta the car!

933
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:42,112
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

934
01:14:44,115 --> 01:14:46,140
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

935
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,115
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

936
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:51,120
Say that again!

937
01:14:51,222 --> 01:14:53,486
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

938
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:56,890
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

939
01:14:56,994 --> 01:14:59,360
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

940
01:14:59,464 --> 01:15:02,228
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

941
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:05,393
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

942
01:15:05,503 --> 01:15:07,971
Stop talkin' and shoot!

943
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:10,939
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

944
01:15:13,044 --> 01:15:15,808
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

945
01:15:15,913 --> 01:15:17,881
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

946
01:15:20,251 --> 01:15:21,718
Get the fuck outta my car!

947
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:24,083
Shit! Damn!

948
01:15:24,188 --> 01:15:26,383
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

949
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:34,320
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

950
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:44,271
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!

951
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:52,042
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

952
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,584
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

953
01:15:54,685 --> 01:15:57,051
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

954
01:15:57,155 --> 01:15:59,350
Gimme my fucking gun!

955
01:16:06,519 --> 01:16:08,316
Fuck!

956
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:13,992
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

957
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:20,889
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

958
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,730
Slowly step out
of the vehicle.

959
01:16:26,839 --> 01:16:30,536
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

960
01:16:33,612 --> 01:16:37,412
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

961
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:53,463
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

962
01:16:53,566 --> 01:16:55,033
Lie face down on the ground.

963
01:16:55,134 --> 01:16:57,602
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

964
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:59,898
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

965
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:02,405
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

966
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:03,475
On your knees now!

967
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:06,272
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

968
01:17:06,378 --> 01:17:09,176
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

969
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:10,839
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

970
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,145
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

971
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:15,584
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

972
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:19,385
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

973
01:17:19,492 --> 01:17:22,017
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

974
01:17:22,128 --> 01:17:23,254
Step away.

975
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:25,353
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

976
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:29,793
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

977
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:32,097
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

978
01:17:32,204 --> 01:17:34,138
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

979
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,834
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

980
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:38,102
Fuck you!

981
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,373
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

982
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,710
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

983
01:17:43,816 --> 01:17:45,181
- and onto that man's patio.
- Officer Hanson, step away.

984
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:49,517
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!

985
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:52,523
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

986
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,718
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

987
01:17:54,827 --> 01:17:58,092
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

988
01:18:03,235 --> 01:18:06,500
You startin' to understand
the situation?

989
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:09,335
What do you want from me?

990
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:13,969
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

991
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:15,979
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

992
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:18,311
and do nothing until I speak
with these officers.

993
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:21,386
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

994
01:18:21,487 --> 01:18:25,514
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

995
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:30,721
Yeah, I can do that.

996
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,094
Good.

997
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,999
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

998
01:18:37,102 --> 01:18:41,869
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

999
01:18:41,974 --> 01:18:44,067
I need this favor.

1000
01:18:44,176 --> 01:18:48,203
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1001
01:18:48,314 --> 01:18:50,874
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1002
01:18:50,983 --> 01:18:55,920
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1003
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,355
Thank you.

1004
01:19:03,162 --> 01:19:07,223
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1005
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,598
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1006
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:14,764
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1007
01:19:16,909 --> 01:19:19,104
Go home.

1008
01:19:22,748 --> 01:19:25,080
Yeah, that I can do.

1009
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:45,495
Look at me.

1010
01:20:46,966 --> 01:20:49,628
You embarrass me.

1011
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:51,828
You embarrass yourself.

1012
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,970
Daddy's home!

1013
01:21:55,901 --> 01:21:57,926
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1014
01:21:58,037 --> 01:22:00,471
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1015
01:22:00,572 --> 01:22:03,871
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1016
01:22:03,976 --> 01:22:05,273
Give me my money!

1017
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:10,108
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1018
01:22:10,215 --> 01:22:12,547
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1019
01:22:12,651 --> 01:22:16,917
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1020
01:22:17,022 --> 01:22:19,320
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1021
01:22:19,425 --> 01:22:23,225
- Mommy?
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1022
01:22:23,328 --> 01:22:27,594
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1023
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:32,932
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1024
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:34,699
Lara, stay outta the street!

1025
01:23:02,301 --> 01:23:05,998
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1026
01:23:06,105 --> 01:23:07,572
I'll protect you.

1027
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,529
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1028
01:23:37,636 --> 01:23:40,628
It's a really good cloak.

1029
01:25:01,853 --> 01:25:03,582
How's it goin'

1030
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:34,341
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1031
01:25:34,453 --> 01:25:36,387
Well, you are one to talk.

1032
01:25:36,488 --> 01:25:40,356
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1033
01:25:40,459 --> 01:25:43,792
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1034
01:25:45,063 --> 01:25:47,122
Yes! At them! Yes!

1035
01:25:47,232 --> 01:25:51,566
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1036
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:55,367
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1037
01:25:55,474 --> 01:25:59,171
at the gardener who keeps
over-watering the lawn.

1038
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:00,245
I...

1039
01:26:01,947 --> 01:26:04,472
I just thought that...

1040
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:08,178
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1041
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:11,256
and I would feel better,
you know?

1042
01:26:11,356 --> 01:26:15,349
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1043
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:19,362
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1044
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:25,166
I wake up like this
every morning!

1045
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:29,229
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1046
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:32,674
Carol, I don't know why!
And I...

1047
01:26:34,346 --> 01:26:37,474
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1048
01:26:37,582 --> 01:26:39,447
Bye.

1049
01:28:30,562 --> 01:28:32,427
Really appreciate this.

1050
01:28:32,531 --> 01:28:34,795
No problem.

1051
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,504
So how long you been
out there tonight? It's cold.

1052
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:44,802
Hour maybe.

1053
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:46,605
Big surprise, huh?

1054
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:49,976
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1055
01:28:50,081 --> 01:28:51,844
True.

1056
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,975
So where you headed?

1057
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:56,212
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1058
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:58,118
I'm goin' to El Segundo.

1059
01:28:58,223 --> 01:29:00,555
El Segundo's cool.

1060
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:01,853
You've been there?

1061
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,860
Fuck no.

1062
01:29:10,168 --> 01:29:11,726
That's some good music.

1063
01:29:15,373 --> 01:29:17,773
No, really. I'm startin'
to understand it.

1064
01:29:18,743 --> 01:29:21,940
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1065
01:29:22,047 --> 01:29:24,345
I'll bet you did.

1066
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,650
Whatever.

1067
01:29:41,566 --> 01:29:43,932
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1068
01:29:44,035 --> 01:29:45,696
Ice-skatin'

1069
01:29:46,805 --> 01:29:47,965
Ice-skatin'

1070
01:29:48,073 --> 01:29:50,633
Love the ice-skatin'

1071
01:29:50,742 --> 01:29:54,371
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be a goalie.

1072
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:56,071
Come on!

1073
01:29:56,181 --> 01:29:59,446
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'

1074
01:29:59,551 --> 01:30:01,519
I think you're having fun.

1075
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,611
Yeah. Whatever.

1076
01:30:13,365 --> 01:30:14,457
Something else funny?

1077
01:30:14,566 --> 01:30:16,796
Oh, yeah.

1078
01:30:19,104 --> 01:30:21,038
Yeah? What's that?

1079
01:30:21,139 --> 01:30:22,766
People, man. People.

1080
01:30:23,942 --> 01:30:25,910
People like me.

1081
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:29,378
No, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1082
01:30:30,482 --> 01:30:32,040
Yeah, I can see that.

1083
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:35,813
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1084
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:38,583
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1085
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:45,288
Come on, man, keep drivin'
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1086
01:30:45,397 --> 01:30:47,763
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1087
01:30:47,866 --> 01:30:50,494
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1088
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:52,467
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1089
01:30:52,571 --> 01:30:54,198
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1090
01:30:54,306 --> 01:30:56,934
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1091
01:30:57,042 --> 01:30:59,067
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1092
01:30:59,177 --> 01:31:01,975
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1093
01:31:27,372 --> 01:31:28,964
Oh, God.

1094
01:31:38,249 --> 01:31:39,773
Oh, God.

1095
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:19,856
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1096
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,051
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1097
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,355
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

1098
01:32:24,462 --> 01:32:28,455
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1099
01:32:32,003 --> 01:32:36,235
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

1100
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:39,310
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

1101
01:32:39,411 --> 01:32:41,743
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1102
01:32:41,846 --> 01:32:45,111
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1103
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:47,377
Yeah, me too.

1104
01:32:47,485 --> 01:32:50,045
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1105
01:32:52,857 --> 01:32:55,348
Hey, Bob.

1106
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:25,372
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1107
01:34:25,483 --> 01:34:28,452
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1108
01:34:28,553 --> 01:34:32,546
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1109
01:34:34,793 --> 01:34:36,317
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1110
01:34:36,427 --> 01:34:39,658
Kim Lee.

1111
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:48,403
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1112
01:34:48,506 --> 01:34:52,704
It's okay. I'm okay.

1113
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:55,974
I went crazy speeding.
I drove into car.

1114
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,945
My God. Are you okay?

1115
01:34:58,049 --> 01:35:00,609
I got into big fight
with poor woman.

1116
01:35:00,718 --> 01:35:02,242
I called her names.

1117
01:35:03,454 --> 01:35:05,718
Oh, fine.
I die from worry

1118
01:35:05,824 --> 01:35:07,883
and you laugh.

1119
01:35:10,395 --> 01:35:12,295
Thank you for finding me.

1120
01:35:14,999 --> 01:35:19,163
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1121
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,603
Go to the locker.

1122
01:35:25,243 --> 01:35:27,177
No, next one.

1123
01:35:30,248 --> 01:35:33,012
In my wallet,
there's a check.

1124
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:35,210
Bring it here.

1125
01:35:43,261 --> 01:35:46,492
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1126
01:35:46,598 --> 01:35:49,965
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1127
01:35:50,068 --> 01:35:55,096
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1128
01:36:11,256 --> 01:36:13,156
I'll take the van.

1129
01:36:13,258 --> 01:36:15,488
They're chained to the van.

1130
01:36:15,593 --> 01:36:17,254
So I'll take them too.

1131
01:36:18,663 --> 01:36:20,688
You wanna buy
these Chinamen?

1132
01:36:20,798 --> 01:36:22,857
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1133
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:25,128
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1134
01:36:25,236 --> 01:36:28,364
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1135
01:36:28,473 --> 01:36:32,807
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1136
01:36:50,929 --> 01:36:53,864
Oh, no!

1137
01:36:57,635 --> 01:36:59,899
No! No!

1138
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,985
This is Dorri.

1139
01:37:30,468 --> 01:37:34,666
My baby. My poor baby!

1140
01:37:36,941 --> 01:37:39,409
Mom.

1141
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:44,174
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1142
01:37:46,084 --> 01:37:48,848
Oh, I already know.

1143
01:37:50,822 --> 01:37:52,551
You did.

1144
01:37:54,892 --> 01:37:59,522
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1145
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:03,430
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1146
01:38:07,872 --> 01:38:10,898
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1147
01:38:11,009 --> 01:38:12,840
I wanna stay.

1148
01:38:12,944 --> 01:38:16,607
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1149
01:38:26,457 --> 01:38:28,254
He came home.

1150
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:31,260
Did you know that?

1151
01:38:31,362 --> 01:38:34,195
My little boy.

1152
01:38:34,298 --> 01:38:36,095
When I was sleepin',

1153
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,260
he brought me groceries.

1154
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:41,361
It's the last thing he did.

1155
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,702
What happened?

1156
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:31,085
What did you do?

1157
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:34,750
What did you do?

1158
01:39:36,928 --> 01:39:38,828
I shoot a little girl.

1159
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:41,160
What?

1160
01:39:41,265 --> 01:39:44,098
No, she's okay. She's...

1161
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:47,863
She's... Here.

1162
01:39:47,972 --> 01:39:53,205
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1163
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:56,303
Nothing happened.

1164
01:39:58,015 --> 01:39:59,175
She's my...

1165
01:40:00,885 --> 01:40:02,682
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1166
01:40:06,491 --> 01:40:08,288
My angel.

1167
01:40:10,428 --> 01:40:12,362
My angel!

1168
01:40:14,165 --> 01:40:16,793
She came to protect me.

1169
01:40:18,102 --> 01:40:20,502
To protect us!

1170
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,037
You understand?

1171
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:30,404
Take this. Please.

1172
01:40:31,983 --> 01:40:33,883
Take it.

1173
01:40:38,256 --> 01:40:40,816
Hey! Hey!

1174
01:40:40,925 --> 01:40:44,486
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1175
01:40:44,595 --> 01:40:46,324
It's okay.

1176
01:40:51,369 --> 01:40:52,996
Okay, Daddy.

1177
01:40:53,104 --> 01:40:54,696
Okay.

1178
01:41:17,862 --> 01:41:19,159
Jean?

1179
01:41:19,263 --> 01:41:21,288
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1180
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:24,095
I fell down the stairs.

1181
01:41:24,202 --> 01:41:27,535
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1182
01:41:27,638 --> 01:41:30,835
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1183
01:41:30,942 --> 01:41:34,378
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1184
01:41:34,478 --> 01:41:37,208
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1185
01:41:37,315 --> 01:41:40,307
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1186
01:41:40,418 --> 01:41:42,818
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1187
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,583
she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1188
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:49,091
That's because she's a bitch.

1189
01:41:49,193 --> 01:41:53,129
She's been my friend for ten years.

1190
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:55,096
All right, honey.
Feel better.

1191
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,497
I'll be there soon.

1192
01:41:59,704 --> 01:42:01,604
I love you.

1193
01:42:01,706 --> 01:42:03,936
I love you too.

1194
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,333
Miss Jean.

1195
01:42:40,378 --> 01:42:43,006
Would you like to sit up?

1196
01:42:48,686 --> 01:42:51,883
Here. Good!

1197
01:43:00,498 --> 01:43:02,693
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1198
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,734
What, Mrs. Jean?

1199
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:09,368
You're the best friend
I've got.

1200
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,865
Hi.

1201
01:46:24,568 --> 01:46:26,058
Hi.

1202
01:46:31,876 --> 01:46:33,605
I love you.

1203
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:05,666
All right.

1204
01:48:05,769 --> 01:48:09,136
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

1205
01:48:11,942 --> 01:48:14,308
All right, come on.

1206
01:48:14,411 --> 01:48:17,869
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

1207
01:48:17,982 --> 01:48:19,449
Come on, y'all.

1208
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:24,516
Come on.

1209
01:49:01,158 --> 01:49:03,251
That's $40.

1210
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,295
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1211
01:49:07,698 --> 01:49:10,223
