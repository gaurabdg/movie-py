1
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,068
- Hey, Will.
- Did you take care of that tab, Bobby?

2
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:30,506
First thing Wednesday after I get paid,
Will. First thing Wednesday, I promise.

3
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,418
Some bad motherfuckin' shit there.

4
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:18,113
You're listening to Rock'n'Roll Radio
on the last three days of the year 1974.

5
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,143
A year in which we saw Watergate
go down, Patty Hearst get abducted,

6
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,855
and Hank Aaron beat Babe Ruth's record.

7
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:30,125
Here's something to bridge the gap
between '74 and the New Year.

8
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,352
You son of a bitch.

9
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,134
Hey, man. I just wanted in
out of the cold.

10
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,361
You came real close this time, Pancho.

11
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,218
Speaking of the devil,
Mr. Raynor just walked in the door.

12
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,503
Well, he's right here. Right.

13
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,380
Jimmy.

14
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,967
Hold on there, boy. We got things to do.

15
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,179
- Will you leave me alone?
- Gotta be, Jimmy.

16
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,639
Can't you see I'm bleeding?

17
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,991
Nettle says it's time
to sacrifice a virgin.

18
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,539
If you listen to everything Nettle says, you
end up mowing the grass in December.

19
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,794
The man ain't reasonable, but you go
along with him, or go someplace else.

20
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,964
That's the choice.

21
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:46,595
Right now we gotta go pick you out
a partner, separate him from the flock.

22
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,937
- There's one.
- Which one?

23
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,485
That nice-lookin' boy, right there.

24
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,616
Shit, Dodd. He ain't nice-lookin'.
He looks just like you.

25
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,787
Maybe 100 years ago.

26
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,955
Nothin' the matter with that.

27
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,653
What do you think?

28
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,714
Grow him some long hair and borrow him
some of your clothes, he'd be just right.

29
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,469
Jimmy, what do you think?

30
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,250
I think it's too fucking cold
to be running in circles.

31
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,893
Could be worse, man. Could be us.

32
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,399
There, you see there?

33
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,469
I bet you five dollars
he wears that skinny boy down

34
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,654
and beats him by 50 yards.

35
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,164
Girl beats 'em both.

36
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:04,506
Might oughta told you he won the 220
for Katterly High School a few years back.

37
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,637
Jesus.

38
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:24,886
Sixty-two, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67.

39
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,488
All right. Good race.
All right. Y'all got 10 minutes...

40
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:38,066
- She got an edge to her, don't she?
- Jimmy, the girl ran track somewhere.

41
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,418
That doesn't mean
you want her watchin' your back.

42
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,283
Nettle ain't gonna wanna put her
in with you. I'll tell you that right now.

43
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,203
First thing he's gonna think
is you'll bang her.

44
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,914
You know how he is about that.

45
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:58,059
The second thing he thinks, if she gets
hurt, how's it make the department look?

46
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,217
Throwin' a little girl like that
into the world.

47
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,653
- I can just hear what he's gonna say.
- She looks stout to me.

48
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,202
Pull her out and talk to her for me.

49
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,502
- I gotta call Nettle and see what he says.
- It's not Nettle's ass. It's mine.

50
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,747
- You don't have to do this, you know.
- I know.

51
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,750
It isn't gonna be the way
you think it is.

52
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,003
- It gets ugly.
- Yes, sir. I know.

53
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,131
No, you don't know.

54
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,273
You get ugly with it.

55
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,471
What d'you ever wanna
do this for, anyway?

56
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,198
Seems like a chance
to make a difference.

57
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,118
I'll tell you what's gonna
be different. You.

58
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,912
Miss Cates, this is Jim Raynor.

59
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,638
He was pretty himself once.

60
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,641
Yeah.

61
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,393
How do you do?

62
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,979
Let's take a ride.

63
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:10,218
It does that by itself.
It gets cold, it just falls down on its own.

64
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,653
- Summertime it works perfect, though.
- That's convenient.

65
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,107
Broke in Montana.

66
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,336
I kept meaning to get it fixed.
Then I came down here, where it's warm.

67
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,282
And I lost my motivation.

68
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,285
Is that where you're from? Montana?

69
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,329
The eastern part.

70
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,055
The "Big Empty".

71
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,018
But now I'm from Katterly, Texas.

72
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,006
Were you a narc up there, too?

73
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,232
Ruins you for anything else.

74
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,236
That's probably not a joke.

75
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,540
So was that bullshit
on your application?

76
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,433
- Coupla joints in high school?
- What?

77
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,006
Your application. It said you'd done
two joints in high school. That was it?

78
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,967
That's it, except once
in junior college.

79
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,818
It was a Catholic school.

80
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,955
We're just talkin' now, you and me.

81
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,579
That's not bad.

82
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,999
Most people pull off to the right
at first. You're steady.

83
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,475
Thank you.

84
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,650
Why'd you ask me that about high school?

85
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,362
'Cause I'm still trying to decide
if I wanna get you into this.

86
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,142
It's a long haul,
and you hate yourself most of the way.

87
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,327
- Is that how you live?
- No.

88
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,690
It's simpler than that for me.

89
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,874
But then I got low self-esteem.

90
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,784
I still can't believe I have to move.

91
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,968
Thank you.

92
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,932
- Gotta do something about your hair.
- What?

93
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,101
Quit washin' it.

94
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,590
There are some things
we gotta talk over.

95
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,732
Okay.

96
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,642
We buy drugs.

97
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,353
Larry Dodd gives us the money.

98
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,524
And he's the only one we ever talk to
in the whole department.

99
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,376
To everybody else, we're junkies.

100
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,449
What that means
is if we get into something,

101
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,634
we ain't gonna call in
no "Officer assist" to get out.

102
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,637
Our "Officer assist" is each other.

103
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,935
So, what I'm saying is when you
come into this it can't be halfway.

104
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,297
I didn't think it was.

105
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,398
You know what you're doin'?

106
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,942
Yeah.

107
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,903
Gotta be able to lie better than that.

108
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,783
I can do what it takes.

109
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,359
Let's see you roll one.

110
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,294
Okay.

111
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,834
You wanna try to light that up?

112
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,086
You do that on the street,
I guarantee you're fucked.

113
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,171
You're fucked.

114
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,898
And I'm fucked with you,
'cause we're partners.

115
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,304
- It's simulation.
- Simulation's something you say in court.

116
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,682
Outside the court
we're here to buy dope.

117
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:55,411
You go in thinkin' these people are stupid,
it'll get you hurt, and me hurt with you.

118
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,942
That's what happens when the shit comes
down, one of us is fucked, we both are.

119
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,753
And that's what this is about.
You and me.

120
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:09,384
'Cause people find out what we do, I mean
either side, the DA or the dealers, it's over.

121
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,302
Over.

122
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,558
All we got is each other.

123
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,188
All right.

124
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,634
- How you doin'?
- All right.

125
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,262
Hey, baby.

126
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,710
- How 'bout a couple of longnecks?
- Jimmy! Where you been?

127
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,713
I've been around. Been around.

128
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,106
- This here's my friend, Kris.
- Hey.

129
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,941
Listen, we were wonderin'
if maybe you could get us some toot.

130
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,835
I might, but not here.
Will's turned paranoid.

131
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,423
Okay. Whenever. You just let me know.

132
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,107
- Where did we meet?
- Houston, two years ago.

133
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,626
I worked in an ice-cream parlor
and you ran a Pizza Hut.

134
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,170
- Where am I from?
- Montana.

135
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,550
I don't know why
I have to come from an ice-cream parlor.

136
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,957
Because the closer to the truth it is,
the easier it is to remember.

137
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,251
But you never worked for Pizza Hut.

138
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,644
No. But I ate there a lot.

139
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,358
- Where did we get our money?
- Insurance. Old woman ran into your car.

140
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,195
You know what this is, right?

141
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,742
It's gonna come up sooner or later.
Might as well be sooner.

142
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,040
- Can you handle this?
- Yeah.

143
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,709
What?

144
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,754
I'm gonna put a needle in my arm.

145
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,725
This is called cooking.

146
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,755
Okay, you cook heroin.
You don't cook coke.

147
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,232
Some people cook speed.
Mostly they don't.

148
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,613
Okay.

149
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,324
Ready to run.

150
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,118
You wanna let it cool first.

151
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,595
Shoot now, you'll parboil your heart.

152
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,598
Let me have your belt.

153
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,766
You do this with a dealer,
you let him go first.

154
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,477
Or your snitch,
you make the snitch go first.

155
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,703
Hot shot, fast as a bullet.

156
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,956
Okay, take it off.

157
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,720
So there it is.

158
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,416
- What's in there, anyway?
- Baby laxative.

159
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,254
- Come on. You can't put that in your vein.
- In a spot, I might.

160
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,647
Makes you piss like a racehorse.

161
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,484
But it looks a little like speed.
It'd pass.

162
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,496
- I'm gonna go wash this up.
- Okay.

163
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,924
Listen, I know this is a little hairy.

164
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,886
- I'm not scared.
- It happens.

165
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,126
All this shit about addiction is
a matter of how strong you are.

166
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,295
I've seen agents brought up for air.

167
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:58,133
They've been doin' it steady
five, six months, plenty strung out.

168
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,385
Gotta get strong.

169
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,014
You kick the bed covers a week or two,
you run a little temperature.

170
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,808
You get up on your feet, stand and walk.

171
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,394
- Cops?
- That's how it's done.

172
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,649
A fuckin' dealer won't split down
with nobody till he knows he's cool.

173
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,943
Business.

174
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,252
That's the way it is.

175
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,858
You gonna need a ride home later?

176
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,320
No, man. I'll get a ride.

177
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,281
See ya.

178
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,534
I got an itch

179
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,996
And I don't know where to scratch

180
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,861
Come on, baby

181
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,294
Scratch my back

182
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,409
What's up, man? You all right?

183
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,511
That feels so good

184
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,688
Now we've got some chicken scratch

185
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,984
Okay

186
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,449
Get up

187
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,621
Yeah

188
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,154
- Mr. Walker.
- How you doin'?

189
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,338
- Kris.
- Hi, Kris.

190
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:33,080
You remember that Blue Hawaiian
last week? That's the guy who had it.

191
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,681
- Yeah, that's me.
- That was good.

192
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,895
A little of that Hawaiian now
could make a person waterproof.

193
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,774
- I got some more, if you're interested.
- Always.

194
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,136
A quarter-pound?

195
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,362
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

196
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,810
- Wouldn't have any of that other stuff?
- What, that white stuff?

197
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,312
Yeah, man. I got some of that.

198
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,289
You wanna go and get it?
Come on, let's go.

199
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,086
Come on, man. I'll drive.

200
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:25,272
- Didn't know you drove a Caddy, Walker.
- Yeah. I had a few of 'em, you know.

201
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,959
Jimmy.

202
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,552
Stuff's all right?

203
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,137
It's all right.

204
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,144
Krissie, why don't you come over here?
Let me fix you a bump. Sit down.

205
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,689
Great.

206
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,436
- There you go.
- Thank you.

207
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:25,249
I got this stuff here from a man
who stuffs deer for a livin'.

208
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,918
This is a screwy world.

209
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,564
Last call, Jimmy.

210
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,151
I think we're about skunked.

211
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,696
Unless you got somethin' besides beer.

212
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,368
I can't now. Will's still out back.

213
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,545
You all right?

214
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,716
I still can't believe I did that.

215
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,803
It just went so natural.

216
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,432
You were good.

217
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:30,230
If nothin' else, the boy deserves
some slack for havin' such jam-up drugs.

218
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,777
But he's gotta stop stealin' these cars.

219
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,408
Will Gaines.

220
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:49,083
Mr. Will Gaines just might be
the biggest dealer in Katterly.

221
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,863
Then again, he might not.

222
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,091
Nettle wants him
the way most guys want pussy.

223
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,954
It's all he ever thinks about.

224
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,415
- Why?
- I don't know.

225
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,725
The chief's a deacon
at the Church of the Savior.

226
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,922
Mr. Gaines owns this bar, the Driller's,

227
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:15,776
the bookstore peep shows
out on the highway west o' town.

228
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,279
I'd say the chief sees him as the Devil.

229
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,994
Chief Nettle tends to see things
in fundamentalist terms.

230
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,957
One of those.

231
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,715
As you all know, I took over the job
of chief of police six months ago.

232
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:58,152
- Acting chief of police.
- Acting chief of police, yes, sir.

233
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,365
At that time I had a cursory knowledge of
the volume of drug trafficking in the city.

234
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:10,289
This syringe was found two weeks ago
on a playground at Lamar Junior High.

235
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,127
A high-school teacher
took this off a sophomore.

236
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:23,620
This here came off a little colored boy
who was selling marijuana to his friends.

237
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,848
I believe we've seen enough now to
appreciate your point, Acting Chief Nettle.

238
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,879
With all respect, sir, I think
the people of Katterly need to know

239
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:37,065
what their children are facing when they
send them off to school in the morning.

240
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,744
Man.

241
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,790
You said you wanted some brown.

242
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,212
There it is.

243
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,256
I like to relax, you know.

244
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,636
Like, I don't know you.

245
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,058
But I like to relax, you know.

246
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,022
So you best be showing me
you ain't the man.

247
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,142
Hey, handsome.

248
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,952
Easy, man. Just gettin' my works.

249
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,665
No puzzle, cuz.

250
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,086
I've got you all fixed up.

251
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,782
Go ahead.

252
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,925
Check it out.

253
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,663
That's some righteous shit there, man.

254
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,473
Satisfaction guaranteed.

255
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,627
Do it, man.

256
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,633
Yeah.

257
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,095
Sweet heaven, here we come.

258
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,145
Jack it off, man.

259
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,357
Yeah. Jack it off.

260
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,374
That's some nice shit, man.

261
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,711
And you know that.

262
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,512
Willie Red gets the best.

263
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,557
Only the best.

264
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:22,397
Kinda make you feel like
floatin' on a cloud of titties.

265
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,028
So what about you, sister?

266
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,558
You wanna taste?

267
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,185
- No.
- No?

268
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,688
No, she don't fix.

269
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,399
The lady, she don't fix.

270
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,166
Oh, man.

271
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:46,171
She be missin' out on
the good things in life.

272
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,053
I think she fix.

273
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,293
I think she fix,

274
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,936
else you don't walk outta here.

275
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,718
Walker told us everything
was cool with you, man.

276
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,137
He said "Just come on by,
everything's fine."

277
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:14,908
Damn straight. Walker cool as
the other side of my pillow, honey.

278
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,868
But you ain't showed me shit.

279
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,248
What the fuck you come down here for?

280
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,502
You don't wanna get down, tell me that.

281
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,384
There you go, baby.

282
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,722
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it.

283
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,394
Yes, Lord.

284
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,149
Pretty soon
you'll be feelin' all unnecessary.

285
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,763
I know.

286
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,114
Don't get nervous, baby.

287
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,324
You amongst friends.

288
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,287
Take your time, girl.

289
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,500
Gonna be high as a Georgia pine.

290
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,078
That's it, cuz. Help her out.

291
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,471
Be a gentleman.

292
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,312
Won't be long now.

293
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,664
Look at 'em.

294
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,710
Bitch got a rush.

295
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,341
Dreamland, honey.

296
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,765
Kinda taste it myself, you know,
just sittin' here watchin'.

297
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,351
Just watchin'.

298
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,011
Don't worry about it, baby.

299
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,904
Happen to the best of us.

300
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,867
You know, you're pretty stout.

301
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:27,124
You're the first white boy
that takes some of this and don't puke.

302
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,194
Well, I'll be wantin' more.

303
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,379
I know you will.

304
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,430
Oh, Lord.

305
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,909
Hi.

306
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,583
You sick?

307
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,263
Did you smell him?

308
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,683
Yeah, they don't take many baths.

309
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,339
It's a better high if they're dirty.

310
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,273
Really?

311
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,944
Yeah. It doesn't leak through the skin.

312
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,994
So what happens now?

313
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,400
- We go back to sleep.
- No, I mean to him.

314
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,793
He's already asleep.

315
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,721
He's just like anybody else. We don't
touch any of them until we get them all.

316
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,980
How bad did that scare you last night?

317
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,942
Some.

318
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,388
But I didn't mind.

319
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,822
And I liked it.

320
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,327
What did you like?

321
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,873
I liked being there with you.

322
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,794
And I liked being scared.

323
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,715
I liked knowing
he was going away for it.

324
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,931
Don't like it too much.

325
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,101
D'you like it too much, Jim?

326
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,315
Yeah, I like it too much.

327
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,172
- You cutting it?
- Yeah.

328
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,510
- Mannitol.
- What the fuck, Jim?

329
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,057
- What the fuck what, Kristen?
- What are you doing?

330
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,978
I told you.
I'm cutting it with Mannitol.

331
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,692
It's all right.
Be plenty left for evidence.

332
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,238
What if I don't think it's all right?

333
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,852
You're a cop.

334
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,494
Arrest me.

335
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,263
Who is it?

336
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,561
- Come on, man.
- Hold on.

337
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,730
Come on, Jim.

338
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:30,304
- Just a damn minute.
- We ain't got a damn minute, Jimmy.

339
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,264
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Walker.

340
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,408
This here is Scully. And this is Glenn.

341
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,619
This is Jim.

342
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,983
- You people nervous?
- Hey, Scully, I told you everything is cool.

343
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,319
Hey. Come here, man.

344
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,379
You wanted somethin', man? 500.

345
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,758
I don't got that in the house, man.

346
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,555
You wanna negotiate?
You wanna split down?

347
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,767
What you got on your mind, man?

348
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,987
Gimme half.

349
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,660
See, the thing is we came over
as a favor to Walker here, you dig?

350
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:23,289
We got other things to do at night besides
come by, find out you ain't got the cash.

351
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,961
Well, you come back tomorrow then, man.

352
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,968
I'm gonna keep this for the trip.
We'll be back.

353
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,096
And next time, you'd better
fuckin' have the money.

354
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,139
You dig?

355
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,601
You know somethin'?

356
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,243
You stink up this room.

357
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:06,317
Fuckers look at my woman like they can't
decide where to stick their dicks in first,

358
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,835
then tell me they're gonna come back!

359
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,008
Right there, you motherfucker.

360
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,803
You dig, man?

361
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,305
You got a piece?

362
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,849
Take it out.

363
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,227
- It's just business.
- Take it out!

364
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,692
It's finished.

365
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,942
What the fuck
are you trying to do to us, boy?

366
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,294
What's goin' on?
I mean, you said you wanted speed.

367
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,428
It's what he said.

368
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,506
I'm scared.

369
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,050
Of them?

370
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,261
That's the Hell's Pussies.

371
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,403
Not them. Us.

372
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:23,034
Somethin's changin' here and we've got
less control of it all the time.

373
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,482
That's the whole game, baby.

374
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,667
Nobody's got control.

375
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,754
It's just bein' out here
you can see that.

376
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:42,053
I've been thinking since Willie Red's,
what if you got shot?

377
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,874
What do I do then?

378
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,059
- You mean dead?
- Yeah.

379
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,524
I would take it as a personal favor
if you'd shoot 'em back.

380
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,610
That's not what I meant.

381
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:06,061
All I know is that
if somebody shoots your partner,

382
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,690
you don't leave it
for the lawyers to sort out.

383
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,584
"Diminished capacity"
and "mitigating circumstances".

384
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,842
That happened, didn't it?

385
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,472
It happened.

386
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,167
- Hey.
- Hey.

387
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,630
- You're losin' weight.
- We're working day and night.

388
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,078
You're closin' in on a dozen cases.

389
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,803
Not bad.

390
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,210
Jesus. Jimmy's buyin'
a shitload of crystal.

391
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,088
That and coke. There's a lot around.

392
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,898
The motorcycle element's takin' it over.

393
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,277
A lot of familiar names here.

394
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,266
- Any news on Gaines?
- We're workin' on it.

395
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:30,453
We're lettin' him see us,
lettin' him know we're interested.

396
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,913
You're wired.

397
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,878
Not bad. I came here from a coke buy.

398
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,839
You're not taking
your work home at night?

399
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,828
I'm so sick of the Driller's Club
I could puke.

400
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:50,723
Then at home it's the same people lyin' on
the couch or bangin' on the door to get in.

401
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,892
That's not what I mean.

402
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,649
I know. But it's a fine line, Dodd.

403
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,141
I used to do a lot of that shit onetime,

404
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,325
till it got me shot in the toe.

405
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,523
You don't know what hurt's about
till you've been shot in the toe.

406
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,082
Well...

407
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,590
You and Jim still sharin' bed and board?

408
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,662
Off and on.

409
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,930
You still got
the other address, though, right?

410
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:36,644
Nettle'll have my ass if it turns out you
and Raynor don't have separate places.

411
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,839
We got the other place.

412
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,815
Good.

413
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,988
There's 4,500.

414
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,118
- Get some rest.
- Right.

415
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,186
All right! Jeez.

416
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,947
Did I bring her home last night?
Jesus! Come on in.

417
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,403
- Need a wake-me-up?
- I was thinkin' more the other direction.

418
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,339
- Well, I might.
- Ludes or a Valium?

419
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,140
- Well, I've got some Kool-Aid.
- Great.

420
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,235
So, I'm glad you came by.

421
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,532
'Cause I've been wanting us to, like,
you know, hold a conversation,

422
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,701
for quite some time.

423
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:24,069
So, my friends and me,
well, we're kinda concerned.

424
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,879
Well, they're kinda concerned about Jim.

425
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,995
Damn. This darn thing.

426
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,498
Every day this thing
comes up 40 minutes slow.

427
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,585
Like, every time,
you know, I'm looking at it,

428
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:45,439
it's like this little voice in the back of my
head saying "Rolex, my ass", you know?

429
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,191
Take it back.

430
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,195
Guy gave it to me for some blow.

431
00:49:55,951 --> 00:50:00,538
There are some people
that think Jim might be a cop.

432
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,490
I'm not sayin' he is.
It's just that some people are wonderin'.

433
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,386
I mean, he shows up last October.
I mean, the dude, he don't work.

434
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,764
He buys dope from everybody in town.

435
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,873
Look, I'm not saying he is.
You understand that?

436
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,294
It's just that folks were wondering...
A man could get hurt.

437
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,133
Well, that's the thing, Walker.
A man could get hurt.

438
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,012
Look, I don't think he is.

439
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,724
But I'm in deep shit if I'm wrong.

440
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:13,110
I just figured you were the one to talk to
'cause, you know, I know you're cool.

441
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,073
I mean, I like you.

442
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,243
And I know, you know,
you'd know if Jim was a cop.

443
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,500
You wanna talk to Jim about this?

444
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,237
Just get this whole thing cleared up?

445
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,421
Yeah, let's talk to Jim.

446
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,262
Jimmy.

447
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,906
Y'all tryin' to hatch somethin'?
Must be 90 degrees in here.

448
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,496
What time is it?

449
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,792
Well, maybe somewhere around 5:00.

450
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,804
Excuse me a minute.

451
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,891
You want coffee?

452
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,556
He probably went in there
and fell back asleep.

453
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,740
- I'll be right back.
- Go ahead.

454
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,922
We got a problem.

455
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,668
Hey.

456
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,630
What's on your mind?

457
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,023
He thinks you're a cop.

458
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:23,240
That right, Walker?
You been tellin' people I'm the heat?

459
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,938
I wouldn't do that, man.

460
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,289
I just think you should know...

461
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,001
People are concerned.

462
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,423
- What made you think I was the heat?
- I don't know exactly.

463
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:46,498
I guess ain't nobody can do as much dope
as y'all have been buying.

464
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,683
And I ain't heard anyone
buyin' from you.

465
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,978
Hey.

466
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,316
Let me get somethin' real clear here.

467
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:05,407
You ever tell one solitary motherfucker
one word of what I say, and I'll kill you.

468
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,118
That simple.

469
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,208
I'll drop this fuckin' hammer on your ass
so fast you'll be dead before you got here.

470
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,670
- You understand?
- Yeah.

471
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,015
Well, you got it right.

472
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:36,689
Oh, hell, boy. You didn't think we were the
heat, what the fuck you come up here for?

473
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,599
All this time I was tryin'
to hit on you.

474
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,769
I just figured maybe I could do it
without old Jim findin' out.

475
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,899
Yeah, well, that's nice,
but we need some answers now, boy.

476
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,360
- You wanna slide or not?
- What do I have to do?

477
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,547
You do what you've been doin'. You
make the introductions and you will walk.

478
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,720
- What does that make me?
- Makes you free.

479
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:15,295
Yeah, well, don't I get a lawyer? I wanna
talk to somebody who's in authority.

480
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,771
And I wanna know what's goin' on, man.

481
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,158
Dodd?

482
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,062
Yeah.

483
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,483
Look, we've got someone here
who wants to work for us. Yeah.

484
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,834
No, no, I checked it out.

485
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,463
No, that, that won't be a problem.

486
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,866
Okay.

487
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,494
- Let's go.
- Where?

488
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,386
We're gonna go see the chief.

489
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,181
Look, I think I oughta have
a lawyer, man.

490
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,214
There's a phone.

491
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,218
You call your lawyer and I'll call the chief,
tell him I made a mistake.

492
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,529
You wanna do 40 years?
You wanna do 40 fuckin' years, Walker?

493
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,033
Which way is it gonna be?

494
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,087
This is Mr. Walker.

495
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,842
How much of Mr. Walker's ass do we own?

496
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,219
Eight or ten cases.

497
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:18,100
We bought from him at least eight times.

498
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,983
You know a fella named Gaines?

499
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,595
Well, yes, sir. I do.

500
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,431
You get us Gaines, son,
you got no problem.

501
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,616
That and cooperate
with the officers on the others.

502
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:40,747
I could try, sir, but Will Gaines don't deal
with nobody he don't know from Houston.

503
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,375
You try hard, son.

504
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:48,490
Wipe that fuckin' smile off your face
and figure this out.

505
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,550
If you don't, you're goin' away.

506
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,850
Man!

507
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,855
Cool it. You'll be okay.

508
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,052
They want Gaines,
and y'all want my friends.

509
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,138
I'm not gonna be okay.
That's my friends, man.

510
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:16,601
Hey, you won't even see the inside
of a courtroom if you do what's right.

511
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,813
Maybe we can work somethin' out
for some of your friends, too.

512
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,234
But first you got this in front of you.
You hear what we're sayin'?

513
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,904
You gonna do it, let's go. Right now.

514
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,422
You show me where your loyalties are.

515
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,120
- What?
- Your buddy that drives that hearse.

516
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,303
Is he holdin'?

517
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,433
- Man!
- Answer me.

518
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,941
Yeah, man.

519
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,642
- Hey, Bobby.
- What's up, Slick?

520
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,811
How you doin'?

521
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,650
So what d'you have in mind, man?

523
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,529
Walker here said you might
be able to score us some coke.

524
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:47,066
Well, if Walker says you're all right,
that's good enough for me.

525
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,335
- How much you want?
- Well, how much you got?

526
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,326
I'm a little bit country

527
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,344
And she's a little bit rock'n'roll

528
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,513
Hey, baby.

529
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:07,561
- Some party.
- Yeah. Look who gets to do the dishes.

530
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,596
Blue ringers.

531
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,724
- I never heard of it.
- Well, me either.

532
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,159
But the dude's got thousands of 'em.

533
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,623
This is the best I've felt
since all this happened.

534
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,890
Dude's name is Monroe.

535
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:48,810
I told him you wanted a coupla
hundred of 'em, if they're any good.

536
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,740
You mind if I just lay here a while?

537
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:07,162
Don't feel too comfortable
at my own place any more, you know?

538
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,919
I'm tellin' you.

539
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,438
Shit.

540
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,833
Watch your step.

541
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,504
You live for music, right?

542
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,804
You want a beer.

543
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,140
Guess I do.

544
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,976
Sit down.

545
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,788
Body temperature.

546
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,125
I keep everything here
human temperature.

547
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,468
So...

548
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,846
How many you want?

549
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,792
Where's the break?

550
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:55,145
$3 apiece up to a hundred.
More than that's $2.50.

551
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,689
A hundred sounds good.

552
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,317
Walker said you'd want more.

553
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,682
No.

554
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,365
A hundred's fine.

555
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,886
- You wanna count 'em?
- No, I trust you.

556
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,721
Yeah?

557
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,840
Let's get fucked up, honey.

558
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,385
I got people waitin' on these.
I gotta drive back.

559
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,402
Let's get fucked up.

560
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,163
I gotta git.

561
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,661
- Peace.
- Peace.

562
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,220
Right.

563
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,891
Happy motorin'.

564
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,419
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

565
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:43,855
If you need help, hang up
and then dial the operator.

566
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,734
Hello.

567
01:05:56,035 --> 01:06:01,039
We're sorry. Your call did not go through.
Will you please try your call again?

568
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,322
Officer Cates.

569
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,828
You all right?

570
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,914
I don't know.

571
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,792
Wanna go back to my place
and talk about it?

572
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,878
I got a cold beer.

573
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,589
No.

574
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,413
What's wrong?

575
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,973
Nothin'.

576
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,810
I just don't feel like
bein' in anybody's house right now.

577
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,155
Can I get you somethin', Jimmy?

578
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,938
There's gotta be more here somewhere.

579
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,048
- You want some Preludin?
- Yeah.

580
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,218
Anything.

581
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,113
- There's nothing in the house.
- Where's this all going, Jim?

582
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,413
We just have to wait and see.

583
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,085
Don't do that.

584
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,965
Don't... Don't...
Don't... Don't do that.

585
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,935
Kristen.

586
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,939
Kristen.

587
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,398
Listen to me.

588
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,332
What?

589
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,090
I'm sorry.

590
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,513
I'm sorry.

591
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,561
Jim.

592
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,939
Jim.

593
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,053
Jim.

594
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,850
Hello?

595
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,852
Yeah.

596
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,610
Hi.

597
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,778
A cab?

598
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,032
On it like a hawk on a June bug.

599
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:01,162
Everybody's always sayin'
"Why don't you just take a cab?"

600
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,797
So who kicked in your door?

601
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,510
It was like that
when I got in last night.

602
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,305
Jim was here. He probably knows.

603
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,474
Where's he at lately?

604
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,603
Out on a deal maybe.

605
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,049
He's worried about Gaines.

606
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,901
Well, Gaines is somethin'
to worry about.

607
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:43,496
Well, listen. Are we workin' tonight?

608
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,233
Yeah.

609
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,795
I got some stuff comin' through from
that taxidermist you introduced me to.

610
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:57,244
I ought to have him bring it by here,
though. I'm not much up to goin' out.

611
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,621
All right.

612
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:03,057
Well, maybe I'll just
hang out here a while.

613
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,645
If you want.

614
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:22,118
Jim?

615
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,137
Where are you?

616
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,583
Lock it.

617
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,380
Just lock the door!

618
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,428
People comin'.

619
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,723
There is nobody comin', Jim.

620
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,519
Yeah, there is.

621
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:31,372
Preludin, Desoxyn, crank.

622
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,542
Preludin, Preludin, Biphetamine.

623
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:36,877
There's no evidence here.

624
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:41,924
What are you doin'?
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

625
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:44,927
My job.

626
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,432
I'm doin' my fuckin' job.

627
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,712
Hey, Jim, talk to me about handlin' it.

628
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,299
I need to hear about
kickin' the covers for a week or two.

629
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,693
Gettin' up on your feet and walkin'!
Tell me that!

630
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:07,158
All I can do is wait
and get everybody out of the way. Away.

631
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,037
They're comin'.

632
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,749
I don't wanna be out of the way, Jim.

633
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,043
Okay?

634
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:19,957
What's wrong?

635
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,486
My chair is gone.

636
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,627
What?

637
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,298
My chair's gone.

638
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:32,970
I sucked it up my ass when Nettle asked
what the hell was goin' on with you two.

639
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,791
- He's hot.
- About what?

640
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,710
About what? He wants to know
where is his case on Gaines.

641
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,045
We're workin' on it.

642
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:44,257
What? That nickel-and-dime shit
you're givin' us on Walker's friends?

643
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,483
You're givin' us nothin' lately.

644
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,781
Where's your partner there
disappeared to?

645
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,647
He up there?

646
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,205
No.

647
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:14,178
He's on a run, isn't he?

648
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,599
He's on a run and you're hidin' him.

649
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,400
Think he's up there turnin' over
a new leaf?

650
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,532
How long's it been?

651
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,831
- A week or two, maybe longer.
- Jesus.

652
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,215
Well, let's go see him.

653
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:02,893
Jimmy?

654
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,440
Jim?

655
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,908
What have you done?

656
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,996
It's all right. He's been there.

657
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,207
But he ain't there now, is he?

658
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:29,070
Not now he's nine-to-five.

659
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,630
Back home with a wife and a family.

660
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,204
How many cases are bad?

661
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:39,998
D'you see?

662
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,726
- I gotta know, man. Give me a number.
- Well, I don't have a fuckin' number.

663
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:48,981
Look, Jimmy. I've been there, man,
right where you are now.

664
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:53,235
We got a problem.
I need to know how bad it is.

665
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,952
You tell me how bad it is, Dodd.

666
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,206
Tell me how bad it is.

667
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:11,170
This is a great deal.
You've landed us both in prison.

668
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:16,368
- Nobody's goin' away over this.
- Not you, Dodd. Get back to the suburbs.

669
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,620
I gotta know. Nettle's gotta know!

670
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,804
Fuck Nettle!

671
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,517
You got somethin' to make him sleep?

672
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,480
Yeah... Yeah.

673
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,775
Fix yourself, Dodd.

674
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,405
You wanna fix up, old buddy?

675
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,745
Gloria has been reading a book
about women's lib.

676
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,998
Oh, jeez.

677
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,860
Three books, Daddy.
I didn't read 'em, I devoured 'em.

678
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,488
Not only that,
I had Michael read 'em, too.

679
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,824
- Mike?
- He recognizes, and you'd better too,

680
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:21,993
that women are individuals.

681
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:26,471
It ain't enough that he's an atheist?
You're turning him into a morphodite.

682
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,752
What's a morphodite?

683
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:34,605
A freak with a little too much of each
and not enough of neither.

684
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,272
You pulled up.

685
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,207
The needles, anyway.

686
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,965
Okay. Under.

687
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:13,143
Now, will you need anything else?

688
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,924
Well, I'll just let you
have your meeting.

689
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,317
It was nice to meet you, Miss Cates.

690
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,580
So, we have a situation.

691
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,333
How bad is it?

692
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,088
Well, let's say I've had a rough time.

693
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,216
Exactly what are we talking about?

694
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,579
Let's pray together.

695
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:24,881
Lord, please offer this man your help and
your strength as he faces a difficult task,

696
01:28:25,758 --> 01:28:30,887
for we are soldiers in your army, and
we fight your enemies with our very lives.

697
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:33,223
Amen.

698
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,312
Looks like you could use a few days off.

699
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,508
Why don't the two of you
go to Corpus Christi, get some rest,

700
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:44,443
then come back
and make the case on Gaines?

701
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,873
Appreciate the confidence.

702
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:03,837
Wait a minute.

703
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:08,034
What'd you say if we told you
Gaines isn't dealin' drugs?

704
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,495
I'd say "When are you
gonna make the case?"

705
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:15,166
Will Gaines isn't dealin' drugs.
At least not to us.

706
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,002
We've tried to get next to the man
for five months.

707
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:21,271
He won't come across with anything.
Nothin'. He won't even talk about it.

708
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:26,443
Now, Will Gaines is a dealer in drugs
and pornography, and that is a fact.

709
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,612
Make the case.

710
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,908
Are you tellin' us to plant evidence?

711
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:40,707
I'm tellin' you that sometimes good work
is accomplished in mysterious ways.

712
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,419
We can't do that.

713
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,619
Make the case.

714
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,163
An arm like that

715
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:57,724
could be hard to explain to a jury,
don't you think?

716
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,512
Here we go.

717
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,703
Look, I need something you've got.

718
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,418
Somebody told me you were a badass.

719
01:31:07,336 --> 01:31:09,588
There's no bad-asses.

720
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,885
Ain't nobody can't die.

721
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:22,960
Tell me somethin', badass.

722
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,353
D'you think I'm stupid?

723
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,960
So it's "Us or them" time.

724
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:54,591
It's got that feel, you know?

725
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:59,429
Somebody's about to get the short stick.

726
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:04,809
I just want it to end.

727
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,298
It isn't gonna soon.

728
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,900
- He'll make bail.
- And then what?

729
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,321
And then we'll see.

730
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:24,120
You know what scares me?

731
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:30,460
The thought of all those people
gettin' up in court, tellin' what we did.

732
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,657
Nobody believes them,

733
01:32:34,757 --> 01:32:37,551
except other dealers and other cops.

734
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:41,680
That's what makes the whole thing work.

735
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:44,099
You never admit to anything.

736
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:48,728
Someone's holdin' the evidence
in your face.

737
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:50,939
Nothing.

738
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,865
What about your arm?

739
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:05,495
I haven't decided yet.

740
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,537
What's goin' on?

741
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,207
We're doin' it this afternoon.

742
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,947
We can prearrange your bail,
arrest you with everybody,

743
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,214
make it look like you weren't involved.

744
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,760
No, I can't do that.

745
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:04,596
That'd make it worse than it already is.

746
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:09,293
Well, you better get outta town,
stay with relatives somewhere.

747
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:14,230
Well, hey, I can't do that either.
My relatives, they all live here in Katterly.

748
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,778
Well, there ain't no place to hide.

749
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,947
People know where you live, Walker.

750
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,742
Well, I expect they do. I mean...

751
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:32,582
We could set you up in Houston.
I'll talk to Dodd.

752
01:34:34,543 --> 01:34:38,072
I got friends gonna be doin' 40 years.
Isn't that what Jim said?

753
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:42,967
40 years for sellin' somebody a dime bag
that I asked 'em to sell.

754
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:48,181
You don't want me to just
run off now and hide. No.

755
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,768
You gonna make me arrest you, Walker?

756
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:04,265
Lookit, Kristen, everything I've done
for the past three months

757
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,602
has been because
I was scared of somethin' else.

758
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,454
And now there ain't nothin'
I'm scared of 'cause it's right here.

759
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:15,917
I'm fuckin' ashamed.
D'you understand that?

760
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:22,549
Yeah. I understand that.

761
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:26,219
Well, you don't got nothin'
to scare me with no more.

762
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:46,591
Officer, put him in the cell,
then go ahead and start the paperwork.

763
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:01,356
Hey, man, you're a fuckin' dead man.

764
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,608
A fuckin' dead man.

765
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:11,241
You're out on bail in 12 hours, right?
You come find me.

766
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:14,911
You come find me,
then we'll see who's dead, okay?

767
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,468
Okay, they're up on the second floor.

768
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:55,511
Cut him, cut him down.

769
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:44,018
I'd like to direct your attention to
case number 97 involving Mr. Will Gaines.

770
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:45,895
Yes, sir.

771
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:49,091
Now, Sergeant Raynor's
already testified in this case,

772
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,985
so we just want to go over it with you.

773
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,098
31 st of May. Do you recall that date?

774
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:57,474
Yes, sir.

775
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,519
In the afternoon of that date
did you and Sergeant Raynor

776
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:04,231
have occasion to speak to each other
concerning Mr. Gaines?

777
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:05,983
Yes, sir, we did.

778
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,652
What was the nature
of that conversation?

779
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:12,990
We discussed the possibility of making a
cocaine purchase from him that evening.

780
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,911
- Where did you make the purchase?
- The Driller's Club.

781
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:21,332
- And what time did you arrive?
- Shortly after 11:00.

782
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,792
Did you meet with Mr. Gaines?

783
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:27,338
Sergeant Raynor did. I sat in the car
while he bought the cocaine.

784
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:30,273
- From Gaines?
- Yes, sir. From Will Gaines.

785
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:35,111
What exactly did you see?

786
01:40:35,237 --> 01:40:38,515
I saw Will Gaines step out the back door
of the Driller's Club,

787
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:41,685
where he engaged Sergeant Raynor
in a short conversation.

788
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:45,564
He turned over to Sergeant Raynor
an envelope filled with white powder

789
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:47,942
which proved to be cocaine.

790
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:53,656
- Are you sure that it was Will Gaines?
- Yes, sir. There is not a doubt in my mind.

791
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,241
Thank you, Miss Cates.

792
01:40:56,341 --> 01:41:00,663
The grand jury appreciates
your time and your testimony.

793
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:05,808
We appreciate the courage you've shown
these last months in buildin' this case.

794
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:09,588
You and Sergeant Raynor
are to be commended.

795
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,522
Yes, sir. Thank you.

796
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,992
Raynor?

797
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:29,566
- Did he make bail?
- $250,000.

798
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:33,002
He got Sam Austin out of Fort Worth
to represent him.

799
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:37,590
I rented us a trailer this morning
over at Spider Lake.

800
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,831
So many of 'em turnin' on each other,
they won't have time to look for us.

801
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,641
I don't know.
We're on TV enough to remind them.

802
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:02,099
There's nothing at the garage
that would interest a girl. Go to bed.

803
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:06,437
No, Daddy. Please tell me a story.
I won't be able to fall asleep. Please!

804
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:08,329
Okay!

805
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:16,379
Feels like a long ride to nowhere,
doesn't it?

806
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:24,554
You know, after I finished with
the grand jury, they applauded me.

807
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,392
It made me feel sick.

808
01:42:33,438 --> 01:42:35,565
I feel sick.

809
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:48,479
You pick a side,

810
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:50,663
because you have to.

811
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,543
It isn't supposed to be the right one.

812
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:02,508
The difference being

813
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:05,928
our intentions were good.

814
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,499
But...

815
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:11,642
The difference
is there isn't any difference.

816
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,484
Jim?

817
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,949
Do you think about Walker?

818
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:11,994
Yeah.

819
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:19,919
When I think about him now,

820
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:24,715
it's like he's a saint.

821
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:16,892
No! Jim!

822
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:38,148
- Press here.
- Shit!

823
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:40,651
Press hard here, okay? Press!

824
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,126
Okay.

825
01:45:57,476 --> 01:45:58,476
I got you.

826
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:05,608
Okay. Jim, I'm gonna get you some help.

827
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,109
Press.

828
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,706
Get away! I already called the police!

829
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:38,333
- Please!
- I'm warnin' you! I got a gun!

830
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:40,476
Go on now! Get away!

831
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,202
Jim.

832
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:02,232
Just a little while longer.
Help's coming.

833
01:47:02,332 --> 01:47:04,484
I think I'm gonna puke.

834
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:05,861
Okay.

835
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:08,879
I'm here. I'm here.

836
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,908
Squeeze my hand.
Can you squeeze my hand?

837
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:14,051
That's good. Good.

838
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:19,583
Jim... Jim...

839
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:21,460
It's okay.

840
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,227
You're doin' great.

841
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:26,313
They're gonna be here any minute, Jim.

842
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,151
Jim, look at me.

843
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,195
Good. Good.

844
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,288
I love you.

845
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:44,832
I love you.

846
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:00,389
They're gonna be here soon, Jim.

847
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,226
Jim?

848
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:07,480
Jim!

849
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:13,194
Jim!

850
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:15,806
Jim!

851
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:17,448
Oh, God!

852
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:20,159
Oh, God!

853
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,037
No! Please!

854
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,706
Jim!

855
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:29,376
Jim...

856
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:34,215
Oh, please, please, God!

857
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,638
Jim.

858
01:49:22,597 --> 01:49:26,475
Now, what happened
after the gun woke you on the couch?

859
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:33,216
I tried to push the barrel away,
and it went off. And then it went off again.

860
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:34,984
Hittin' your partner?

861
01:49:36,194 --> 01:49:39,139
And you never saw the man
firin' the gun?

862
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,099
No, sir, not at all.

863
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:44,478
You're sure? If he was leanin'
in the window with a shotgun...

864
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,662
I'm sure.

865
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:51,067
I understand you quit the department?

866
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:53,252
That's correct.

867
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:58,007
You'll be someplace we can find you?

868
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,479
The prosecution calls Kristen Cates.

869
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:10,272
Raise your right hand and be sworn.

870
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:13,441
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

871
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,417
- I do.
- Be seated.

872
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:25,511
Miss Cates, you were an undercover
narcotics officer for the city of Katterly.

873
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:29,583
- Yes, sir, I was.
- You don't currently hold that position.

874
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:32,669
No, sir. I'm no longer
with the police department.

875
01:51:32,769 --> 01:51:36,939
- How long were you on the force?
- Approximately seven months.

876
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:39,801
And you were responsible
for how many arrests?

877
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:43,737
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, a hundred?

878
01:51:45,323 --> 01:51:47,825
Possibly. With my partner.

879
01:51:49,452 --> 01:51:52,204
Can you briefly describe that process?

880
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:54,456
- The process?
- Yes.

881
01:51:57,293 --> 01:52:00,530
We purchased drugs, put what we bought
into evidence envelopes

882
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,464
and turned them in to Captain Dodd.

883
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:08,345
Miss Cates, would you read the name
and date on this envelope, please?

884
01:52:15,603 --> 01:52:18,272
"Gaines, William Robert."

885
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:22,067
"May 31 st, 1975."

886
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,821
Is this an envelope
you turned over to Captain Dodd?

887
01:52:25,947 --> 01:52:28,099
Yes, sir.

888
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,534
Can you tell us what was inside it?

889
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:32,995
Cocaine.

890
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:37,583
- State exhibit, Your Honor.
- That's received.

891
01:52:40,128 --> 01:52:45,674
You and your partner
purchased this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

892
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:50,288
Miss Cates,

893
01:52:50,388 --> 01:52:54,475
did you and your partner
purchase this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

894
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:02,926
You testified under oath
in front of a grand jury

895
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:07,738
that you and your partner
purchased this cocaine from Mr. Gaines.

896
01:53:12,368 --> 01:53:13,937
Miss Cates?

897
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:18,081
Did you and your partner
purchase this cocaine from Mr. Gaines?

898
01:53:22,545 --> 01:53:23,879
No, sir.

899
01:53:27,383 --> 01:53:29,619
- It was a stash.
- Miss Cates?

900
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:34,556
My partner and I were ordered by Chief
Nettle to falsify a case against Gaines.

901
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:37,794
Your Honor,
the witness has committed perjury.

902
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:40,437
Order in the court, please. Order!

903
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,106
Order!

904
01:53:44,734 --> 01:53:47,319
The prosecution requests a mistrial.

905
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:09,484
I told you sorry bastards
to stay outta my car.
