Directed by
HERBERT SELPIN

2
00:00:56,632 --> 00:01:02,298
"This film depicts the sole voyage
of the luxury liner Titanic...

3
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:07,512
whose fate was to hold the world
in suspense for months.

4
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:11,778
It is April, 1912."

5
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,399
Gentlemen.

6
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:32,154
Dear shareholders...

7
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:35,802
I called this meeting
of the White Star Line...

8
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,615
to inform you of the following:

9
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:42,237
We have built the Titanic,
the largest ship in the world.

10
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,785
There have been unforeseen incidents
and unexpected difficulties.

11
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,495
Construction costs have escalated
month after month.

12
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:52,450
We were forced to stretch
our finances to the extreme...

13
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,881
exhaust our investors...

14
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,842
and what's more,
take out substantial loans.

15
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,029
As a result...

16
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,920
the share price is plummeting.

17
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:07,435
Mr. President.

18
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,185
May I ask how much
share capital you represent?

19
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:12,722
200,000 pounds,
Mr. President.

20
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,910
So permit me to ask you:

21
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:19,567
Can't this drop in share price
be stopped?

22
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:23,113
It's out of my hands.

23
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,330
White Star Line at 98!

24
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:32,740
Who will buy White Star Line at 98?

25
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,238
96!

26
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm selling White Star Line at 96!

27
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,218
95!

28
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,893
White Star Line at 95!

29
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:48,692
I'm selling White Star Line at 95!

30
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:52,350
Gentlemen.

31
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,513
- The latest word is 95.
- 95.

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,939
That's right, Henderson. 95.

33
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,642
And it will keep going down.

34
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,910
Or do you think all the little people
who invested their pennies...

35
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,312
will just sit on their shares?

36
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:07,781
You should be happy if they sell.

37
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,798
Then the price will drop even more...

38
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:12,989
and give us even more chances
to buy on the cheap.

39
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,658
I agree.

40
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:19,805
We're the board of the White Star Line,
not some charity.

41
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:23,115
But what do we do now?

42
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:26,169
It's simple.

43
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:31,280
We sell too
and bring the price even lower.

44
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,159
- You think so?
- Are you positive?

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,306
Yes.

46
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,532
- Can you give us a guarantee of that?
- I believe so.

47
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,001
- Really?
- Let's hear it!

48
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,638
Next week, the Titanic makes
her maiden voyage over the big pond...

49
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:48,211
and you, gentlemen,
will be aboard as my guests.

50
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:49,844
On this trip...

51
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,381
you will experience
a sensational surprise...

52
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:56,623
that will cause
our shares to skyrocket.

53
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,962
I don't care to say any more
about it right now.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,054
But I ask all of you to trust me...

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,016
just as we all trust our Titanic,
the proudest ship ever to sail...

56
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,499
soon to set to sea for the honor
of the white Star Line...

57
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,516
and the glory of England.

58
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,295
Wherever Ismay goes,
the lovely Gloria can't be far behind.

59
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,771
What nerve, to bring
his girlfriend with him!

60
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:52,725
Perhaps he wants to marry her
on the high seas. Wonderful idea.

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,723
Ismay marries the lovely Gloria
on the maiden voyage of the Titanic.

62
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,248
Makes perfect sense.

63
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,827
Maybe that's the sensation
he promised us.

64
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,634
So, Captain Smith,
we understand each other.

65
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:06,833
For arrival on schedule in New York
I will pay you $5,000.

66
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:10,005
And for every hour ahead of schedule,
another $1,000.

67
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:13,679
So the faster your ship,
the greater your reward.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,738
Who is that?

69
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,760
Sigrid Olinsky,
a wealthy Baltic woman.

70
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,748
Travels all over the world.
Rather extravagant.

71
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,738
- It shows. Married?
- No.

72
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,269
- Alone on board?
- Yes.

73
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:32,172
Should we invite her to our table?

74
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:34,718
- If you wish, Mr. President.
- Yes, please.

75
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,328
Do we have to, Bruce?

76
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:46,328
My dear Gloria, I'm not on board
for my private amusement.

77
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,807
I'm also here as president,
and as such, I have certain duties.

78
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,654
President Ismay requests the honor
of your presence at his table.

79
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,278
With pleasure.

80
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:05,237
So, the president has the honor...

81
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:07,598
Of having 20 million more
at his table.

82
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,370
- That much?
- At least.

83
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,434
They say she has
enormous estates in Russia.

84
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:17,580
Gentlemen,
the aristocracy in the flesh.

85
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:21,574
The Duchess of Canterville
and Lord Archibald Douglas.

86
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,352
Her Highness' net worth:
around 20 million.

87
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:26,650
- And his?
- Two million...

88
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,217
in debt.

89
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,984
There's room for improvement there.

90
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:31,376
Who are those two?

91
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,870
Professor Bergmann
and his assistant, Dr. Lorenz.

92
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,090
- How much?
- Not worthy of mention.

93
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,491
German scientists only count in marks.

94
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,978
Senor Cristobal Mendoz of Cuba.

95
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,218
Never seen him before.

96
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,437
Your misfortune.
He's especially interesting.

97
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:56,024
- How much do you estimate he's worth?
- I'd say around eight to ten...

98
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:58,527
years in prison.

99
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:02,384
I'll nab him in the act this trip,
or I'll resign as ship's detective.

100
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,296
Here comes the one man...

101
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,321
who could give his wife the Titanic
as a birthday present:

102
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,033
John Jacob Astor and his wife.
The richest man on board.

103
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,966
These are the two
we've been waiting for.

104
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,806
Excuse me.
As chief steward, duty calls.

105
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,685
I'll go see to the lovely people.

106
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,301
And I, dear doctor,
to the not so lovely.

107
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:40,971
Ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:44,441
Please give your attention to
the president of the White Star Line...

109
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,013
Sir Bruce Ismay.

110
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:55,503
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to welcome you aboard our newest ship.

111
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:01,754
You already know that at 46,000 tons,
the Titanic is the world's largest ship.

112
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:06,486
You also know that English experts say
she is the world's safest ship.

113
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:11,312
But I'd like to inform you
of a third feature of the Titanic:

114
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:15,733
She is also the fastest ship
that has ever sailed the Atlantic.

115
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:24,111
At this very moment,
what you are experiencing...

116
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:28,657
is the Titanic cruising
at 261/2 knots...

117
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,715
a world-record speed.

118
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,443
Ismay is a genius.

119
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:47,505
Let's get to the telegraph
and buy all the shares we can.

120
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,722
Before it hits the papers.

121
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:12,012
The ship's crew informs
the passengers in steerage...

122
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,960
that the Titanic
is sailing at record speed...

123
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,139
specifically at 261/2 knots.

124
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:22,781
That makes the Titanic
the fastest ship in the world.

125
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:32,582
261/2 knots.
How fast is that?

126
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,653
One nautical mile is 6,076 feet.

127
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:42,037
261/2 times 6,076 is...

128
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:43,776
It's beyond me.

129
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,156
First one with the answer gets a kiss.

130
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:56,044
My God, that's easy.
It's about 30 miles.

131
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:59,077
It is precisely
31 miles per hour, Marcia.

132
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:03,804
No, precisely 30.495 miles per hour.

133
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,331
Attention, everyone.

134
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,919
The ship's management has announced
each of you will receive a bonus...

135
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,075
if the current speed is maintained.

136
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,390
"Liverpool - New York
Calm sea.

137
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:35,328
Everything fine on board.
Petersen"

138
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:43,044
Mr. Morlock, would you please
read the temperature?

139
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,545
Yes, Herr Petersen.

140
00:10:57,478 --> 00:11:00,146
Exterior temperature, 54°.

141
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,133
Thank you.

142
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,592
What weather!

143
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:11,728
If it stays calm, we'll be in New York
at least a day ahead of schedule.

144
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,743
Meanwhile the engines are ruined.

145
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:16,933
President Ismay surely knows
what he's doing, ordering this speed.

146
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,045
Sailor.

147
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,829
Who's running this ship?
Ismay or the captain?

148
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:25,904
The captain naturally does
what the president of the line requests.

149
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,384
And why does he request
such rubbish?

150
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,960
Mr. Brede?

151
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,782
That comes to $9.

152
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,930
Here's $20.

153
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,855
- Keep the change.
- But see you send it immediately.

154
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,518
Thank you,
but we don't accept tips.

155
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,850
The telegrams are sent
in the order received.

156
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,497
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

157
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:53,087
We make the world record and
already they're looking to profit from it.

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,315
Look at this.

159
00:11:55,391 --> 00:12:00,808
One is buying 200,000 White Star shares,
and the other 250,000.

160
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,699
Almost half a million.
What I could do with that!

161
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,585
And when the world hears
that we're sailing at record speed...

162
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:08,455
Let me see.

163
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,827
No, first the president's telegram
to the press.

164
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,075
Yes, sir.

165
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,465
"Sailing at 261/2 knots.
Record speed... Ismay."

166
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,165
"Titanic sails to world record... Ismay."

167
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:22,740
"Record speed of 261/2 knots... Ismay."

168
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,867
"Sailing at 261/2 knots.
Record speed... Ismay."

169
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,007
"Titanic Sails at 261/2 Knots
World Record!"

170
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,201
"Will the Titanic Break
the World Record?"

171
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:08,003
Today isn't the 13th, it's the 14th.

172
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:12,202
And it's a beautiful Sunday as well,
with fine weather and pleasant music...

173
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:15,340
and everyone is happy about
arriving in New York tomorrow.

174
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,242
And we're happy too, Bibifax.

175
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:24,129
- Aren't we happy, Bibifax?
- Yes, and I'm happy, too.

176
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,155
Because everyone wants to announce
their early arrival by telegram.

177
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:32,750
Same old story: They have all the fun,
and we have to work.

178
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,637
- Good morning, Mr. Brede.
- Mr. Hopkins.

179
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,455
- What can I do for you?
- Is the latest market report in yet?

180
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,334
Sorry. Not yet.

181
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,910
Too bad.
Mr. Astor is anxiously awaiting it.

182
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,476
I can well imagine.

183
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,629
All of the gentlemen
seem very interested.

184
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,297
- Good morning, Mr. Phillips.
- Good morning, Mr. Hopkins.

185
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,453
Just a minute.
Something is coming through.

186
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,278
President Ismay has already
looked in a couple of times.

187
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,878
He's waiting anxiously
for the latest news.

188
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:03,199
Nothing to be do about it, I guess.
Good day.

189
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:07,236
Wait a minute, Mr. Hopkins.
Here comes the latest news.

190
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:10,532
What is it, gentlemen?
Why so nervous?

191
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:13,835
We bought White Star shares
on your advice.

192
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:15,750
You promised us a huge profit.

193
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,006
And we're going to lose our shirts
if the price keeps falling.

194
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:20,515
We're sailing at record pace.
The Blue Ribbon is ours for sure.

195
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,124
- The price has to climb.
- Well, it's falling now.

196
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,660
Correct. For now.

197
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:30,764
There is some power at work that
we are unfortunately not yet aware of.

198
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,743
Hopkins?

199
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,707
Did you get the latest news?

200
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,367
Yes. 71.

201
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:44,259
Ismay has bet everything
on his speed record...

202
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:46,585
but he has miscalculated.

203
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:48,465
I'll drive it even lower.

204
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,611
No need to stand.
Have a seat.

205
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,744
Do you know what, Hopkins?

206
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:56,727
I'll drive the colossus down to 60.

207
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,789
And when will you buy it back?

208
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,869
Very good question.

209
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,790
When Ismay's group has grown
nervous and panic selling sets in...

210
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:07,682
when, with my help,
White Star has dropped to 60...

211
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,603
and no one dares buy...

212
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:13,140
then I'll buy.

213
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:17,805
I'll have 510/0 of all shares
in my hands...

214
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,983
and White Star Line
and the Titanic will belong to me.

215
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,098
I understand.

216
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:29,275
You see, the Titanic
is not just a bunch of shares.

217
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,708
She is a tangible asset.

218
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:34,386
Tangible assets create power...

219
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:38,939
and power is a means
to whatever you want.

220
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,184
That's right, John.
Whatever you want.

221
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,716
And for you
that means even more power.

222
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,325
Absolutely right, Madeleine.

223
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:51,654
Jenny, bring out the jewelry.

224
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:55,374
Hopkins, close the safe.

225
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,688
To each his own, Madeleine.

226
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,602
For me, more power.
For you, more jewelry.

227
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,340
Jewelry is also an asset.

228
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,759
But not always stable.
Even gems are subject to fluctuation.

229
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:13,237
And they can only be accurately judged
when they are taken out of their setting.

230
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,608
Just like women.

231
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,566
You're in high spirits today.

232
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,475
I have every reason to be.

233
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,175
Like how I look?

234
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:25,025
Yes, of course.

235
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,650
But if Ismay thinks
he's a match for me, he's mistaken.

236
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:31,907
Which do you love more...

237
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,858
your business or me?

238
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:37,472
There is a time for everything.

239
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,206
Which means, right now...

240
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,944
your business.

241
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,937
See you later.

242
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,884
Madeleine.

243
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,311
Where are you going?

244
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,257
For a breath of fresh air.

245
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:03,231
Hey, Professor!

246
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,380
Excuse me?

247
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,298
Don't you remember me?

248
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:09,110
No, I'm afraid not.

249
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,610
Cristobal Mendoz.

250
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,602
We sailed to Buenos Aires together.

251
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,438
Look at that.

252
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,975
Cristobal Mendoz
and Professor Bergmann.

253
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,753
How curious!

254
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:23,076
I never would have guessed
they knew each other.

255
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,963
Then we must have met
on the Pacific.

256
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:30,096
No, we didn't meet there either.
Good day.

257
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,824
- Here you are, Miss Hedy.
- Thank you.

258
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,575
Could you tell me
where cabin 350 is?

259
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:44,491
- Second corridor on the left.
- Thank you.

260
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,693
- What a mess!
- I'm sorry.

261
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,910
I'm the one who should apologize.
It's my fault.

262
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,976
- Really?
- Of course.

263
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,751
- Please don't trouble yourself.
- I'm happy to help.

264
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,845
If the head steward sees,
there will be a scene.

265
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,273
- Why?
- I'm just an employee.

266
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:03,442
What a coincidence! So am I!

267
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:05,064
Allow me to introduce myself:

268
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:07,397
Franz Gruber, first violin
in the first stateroom...

269
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:08,505
on the first voyage.

270
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,530
Then you may help after all...

271
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,623
or we'll both hear about it.

272
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,870
- You know what?
- What?

273
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,520
Allow me to make a suggestion.
Give me a manicure.

274
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,469
Don't talk such nonsense.
Give me a hand.

275
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,417
- Where does this go?
- Here.

276
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,030
And that too?
There, that's done.

277
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,658
Thank you very much.

278
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,950
Do you think we could
perhaps see each other again?

279
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,194
Sometimes I go for a walk
on the upper deck.

280
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,723
When is sometimes?

281
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:41,118
Oh, rather soon.

282
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,994
Rather soon or very soon?

283
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,693
Just past 12:00.

284
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,637
Come in.

285
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,249
Pardon me. I would like
to speak to you for a moment.

286
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,259
I'll be right there.

287
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,933
And this one too.

288
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,691
What's the matter?

289
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,305
I overspeculated.
I totally miscalculated.

290
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:24,956
Miscalculated?
How can that be?

291
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:28,601
You achieved what you wanted.
We're sailing at record pace.

292
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:31,485
And the share price
is plummeting at record pace!

293
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,620
If it keeps up, I'll soon be ruined.
If I only knew who was behind it!

294
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,607
Someone is doing to me exactly what
I wanted to do to everyone else.

295
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,054
But there must be a way out.
Can / be of help to you?

296
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,708
You be of help to me?
How could you be of help to me?

297
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:47,513
I need millions.

298
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:51,440
I bought shares privately,
do you understand? On personal credit.

299
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm fighting for my very life!

300
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,050
Pull yourself together.

301
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,424
You think I want to spend
the last few days before our wedding...

302
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:00,268
sharing in your disaster?

303
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:04,611
No. So think it over calmly.

304
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,917
You have an excellent position...

305
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:10,979
the best connections,
the most influential friends.

306
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,473
Ask them to help you.

307
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,533
If you ask, you don't get a penny.

308
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,678
Anyone who has to ask
has already lost all his credit.

309
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,026
The amount I need means nothing to you,
but it means something to me.

310
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:26,472
A million in debt or in assets...
it's all the same.

311
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:30,826
What do you mean?

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,964
Those to whom you owe
the million can't let you go under.

313
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,058
All the more reason for you
to lend me the money.

314
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:42,121
I don't lend money.
I'd rather give it away.

315
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:45,704
But since I'm no great apostle of charity,
I don't give it away, either.

316
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,539
I see that...

317
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,835
You see nothing,
not even the opportunity before you.

318
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,750
Opportunity?

319
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,137
Meaning?

320
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:56,996
I have certain business plans.

321
00:20:57,248 --> 00:21:02,700
It would be easier to carry them out,
say, under the name of Lord Douglas.

322
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:04,156
Excuse me, but...

323
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:08,916
I would think long and hard about
that "but" if I were in your position.

324
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:12,396
Shall we say tomorrow
in New York?

325
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:16,467
Astor.

326
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,278
Until tomorrow, Lord Douglas.

327
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,483
- Hopkins?
- Yes, sir?

328
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,261
Why did you permit Lord Douglas
to enter so freely?

329
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:34,572
Pardon me.
Your wife told me to.

330
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,310
My wife?

331
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:42,193
Ah, yes, I remember.
Thank you, Hopkins.

332
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:06,003
Mr. Seipoler, my shift is over.
If anything happens, I'll be in the bar.

333
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,723
You hear that?

334
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,347
"If anything happens."

335
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:14,096
How is it that we have even
one German officer on board?

336
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:18,856
An Englishman was scheduled,
but he got a bad case of appendicitis.

337
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,923
So the captain hired Petersen,
whom he knew from before.

338
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:23,834
Temperature, please.

339
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:26,924
44.8.

340
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,832
It's dropped four more degrees
in four hours.

341
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:34,463
Please, sit down.

342
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:38,330
Legs up.

343
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,217
Be reasonable.

344
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:43,018
You think I'm unreasonable?

345
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,798
I'm an employee
and you're an employee.

346
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,128
Tomorrow you'll be
in some other part of the world.

347
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:49,520
You know what?

348
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:52,132
If it's okay by you, from now on
I'll only accept assignments...

349
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:53,590
if you're on them, too.

350
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,268
Are you serious?

351
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,691
Yes, Miss Hedy.

352
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:01,229
There's something
I have to tell you, Mr. Gruber.

353
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,218
What would you like to confess?

354
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,500
I'm actually engaged.

355
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:09,331
What does "actually" mean?
Either one is engaged or one isn't.

356
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:14,336
My parents would like me
to marry the neighbors' son...

357
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,252
as would his parents...

358
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,235
and since he's a fine person...

359
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,704
He would too, and you,
the obedient daughter...

360
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:23,172
will marry him, and live unhappily
ever after, right?

361
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,833
- Yes.
- No, you won't.

362
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:28,030
You should marry out of love,
not out of obedience. Understood?

363
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,214
Yes, sir.

364
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:32,386
This is my first ocean voyage ever.

365
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:35,028
- Really, Your Highness?
- And do you know why?

366
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:40,791
I always had a strong feeling
I should not go on a ship...

367
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:42,740
that something
would happen to me.

368
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:45,968
- Your Highness!
- Lord Douglas laughed at me too.

369
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:50,173
But I still would not have sailed
if they had not assured me...

370
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:55,599
that the Titanic is
the first unsinkable ship in the world.

371
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,387
So I'm no longer afraid at all.

372
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:02,489
I would love to get some sun.
Will you come along?

373
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,017
Gladly.

374
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:09,960
Herr Petersen.

375
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,741
Shall we go?

376
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,097
I'd like to remain here a while,
Your Highness.

377
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,729
Very well, child.

378
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:25,948
Here you are.

379
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:33,043
Excuse me. I mistook you
for the Herr Petersen...

380
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:37,383
who was first officer on the Excelsior
when I sailed to Egypt.

381
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:40,481
You look just like him.

382
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,321
But that Herr Petersen was a charming
and especially courteous man.

383
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,337
He would have greeted me differently.

384
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,598
Pardon me, madam. I wasn't aware
I was being discourteous.

385
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:54,418
Why are you in such a foul humor?

386
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,788
You used to smile so nicely.
Or are you on duty?

387
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,958
No, I'm off duty,
just like that time in Cairo.

388
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,355
Yes, I behaved dreadfully there.

389
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,065
And I was so pleased
that you wanted to show me Cairo.

390
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,011
Do you really know
what happened back then?

391
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:11,971
I only know you were no longer on board
when I got back from Alexandria.

392
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,765
- I really have to go.
- How come?

393
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:17,223
I'll tell you tonight.

394
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:19,477
- Until then.
- Until then.

395
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:25,219
You take me for a spoiled,
superficial woman...

396
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,273
who indulges
her every whim, don't you?

397
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:32,967
Now I would seem discourteous
if I didn't insist to the contrary.

398
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:36,551
I wouldn't want to disappoint you again.
You must be right.

399
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:44,233
And my whim now is to prove
you will do anything I want.

400
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,146
That won't be difficult,
since as first officer...

401
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:50,105
it's my duty to fulfill the wishes of
the passengers as much as possible.

402
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,482
But there must be things
you're expressly forbidden to do.

403
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,298
Of course. For example, I may not
visit passengers in their cabins...

404
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,433
- or take them to the engine room...
- That's enough.

405
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:02,301
I would like to see the engine room.

406
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:05,403
But madam, I just told you
that's not allowed. I'm sorry.

407
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:10,921
Fine. Then perhaps you would
accompany me to the billiard room?

408
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,069
Gladly.

409
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:17,571
Well played,
but poorly thought through.

410
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,933
You've left yourself wide open.

411
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,992
Not at all. You'll score
500 points at most...

412
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:25,079
and you're behind by 1,000.

413
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,947
- Now what do you have to say?
- I didn't plan on that.

414
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:37,830
Who doesn't plan for everything
sees his plans go awry.

415
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,441
What is that supposed to mean?

416
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:44,401
Just a figure of speech.
At any rate, we're now tied.

417
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:46,033
Sir Bruce...

418
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,990
I have a big favor to ask you,
and you may not refuse.

419
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,397
Then of course I will not.

420
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,183
I'd love to see the engine room.

421
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:58,477
A fine idea!
We'll all come along.

422
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:00,735
Are you interested?

423
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,589
Very much.
I'll just let my wife know.

424
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:08,809
But we must have an expert guide.
Could Herr Petersen come along?

425
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,475
- He just got off duty.
- But of course.

426
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:13,393
Would you please show us
the engine room?

427
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:16,004
Mr. President, I am unfortunately
not authorized to do that.

428
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,090
This is an official order.

429
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,942
As first officer, I'm not allowed
to accept official orders from you.

430
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,285
I see. Mr. Braun?

431
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,388
Please call the captain.

432
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:35,956
We're going to see the engine room.
Will you come along?

433
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,092
No, I'm not interested.

434
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,396
Besides, I'm sure
I'd find it too hot and dirty.

435
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,027
As you like.

436
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,842
I thank you.

437
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,509
It's your move.

438
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:58,613
Do you want to sacrifice your king?
I could eliminate him right now.

439
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,458
Is that really possible?

440
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,200
If I wish to, yes.

441
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:06,019
The queen feels strong enough
surrounded by a knight and her pawns.

442
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,475
Madeleine.

443
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,710
You seem to confuse
games with reality.

444
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:13,805
Sometimes a game
can become reality.

445
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,999
Let's play on.

446
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:37,618
Excuse me.

447
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,522
I'd like to send a telegram.

448
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:44,431
Address, please?

449
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:47,316
- Herr Ludwig Schramm.
- We can leave out the "Herr."

450
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,300
Hamburg, Große Bleichen 15.

451
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,697
Große Bleichen 15. Text, please?

452
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,822
- No.
- You don't want to send a telegram?

453
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:56,595
I mean the text is "No,"
and sign it "Hedy."

454
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,948
"Ludwig Schramm, Hamburg,
Große Bleichen 15. No. Hedy."

455
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,902
- Is that all?
- Yes.

456
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:44,602
I'm going to see Phillips
in the telegraph room.

457
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,868
Helm.! Fifteen to port.!

458
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:55,969
Another ice warning.

459
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,862
Set everything else aside
and try to get other reports.

460
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,307
Another ice warning.

461
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,323
We're sailing right into drift ice.

462
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:06,890
- What was the last temperature?
- 41 °.

463
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:08,584
Another four degrees lower.

464
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:10,644
A sure sign we're getting
close to the ice zone.

465
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:13,075
I'll advise the captain
to take further measures.

466
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:23,435
There are warnings about drift ice
and even reports of icebergs.

467
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:25,203
What measures have you taken?

468
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,674
I've changed course
and reduced our speed.

469
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:31,007
Why? You'll certainly recognize
an iceberg in plenty of time.

470
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:33,266
Pardon me, but you're mistaken.

471
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:38,452
Some icebergs are miles long
and 7/8 of them are underwater.

472
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,374
There is the danger of colliding
with the underwater mass.

473
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:45,438
Danger? That's ridiculous.
The Titanic is unsinkable.

474
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:48,110
Proof of that has not yet
been provided.

475
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:51,696
I demand you maintain
direct course at full speed, Captain.

476
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:56,139
That is a great responsibility for me.

477
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:58,232
If I may be permitted to comment...

478
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,733
such a responsibility
is intolerable for any seaman.

479
00:31:00,806 --> 00:31:02,050
What is that supposed to mean?

480
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:06,915
Staying the course at full speed
would endanger over 2,000 lives.

481
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:10,465
In the event of catastrophe, there isn't
nearly enough room in the lifeboats...

482
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:12,412
for even a small portion
of the passengers.

483
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:14,664
Enough of your pessimism.

484
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:18,562
It's not pessimism. It's our duty
to consider every possibility.

485
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:21,033
That's intentional pessimism!

486
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,077
What do you mean by that?

487
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,773
Please, Herr Petersen...

488
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:27,076
What I mean is that,
as the only German officer on board...

489
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:31,114
you have no interest in the Titanic
winning the Blue Ribbon.

490
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,995
You will account for that remark
at the appropriate time.

491
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,952
Captain, we await
your orders on the bridge.

492
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,452
Captain, you know what
the White Star Line expects of you.

493
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,682
I know very well, Mr. President.

494
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:12,099
Captain, ice warning from the SS Baltic.

495
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:14,387
They urgently advise reducing speed.

496
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,263
Thank you.

497
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,557
The Baltic is a little tub.
We have to keep that in mind.

498
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,111
No change.

499
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:39,142
We will sail on course throughout
the night, full speed ahead.

500
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:43,826
If you need me,
I'll be in the ballroom.

501
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:55,996
So, you have the honor of sailing on
the fastest and safest ship in the world.

502
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,673
Tomorrow you'll be in New York.

503
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,801
And there I'll have
the honor of resigning.

504
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:03,501
I will not be a party
to such lack of responsibility!

505
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:11,396
Sailor, my binoculars.

506
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:15,598
You look as if the ship's ghost
is sitting up there and saying...

507
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,737
"Stay calm, people. Today is Sunday.
You have the Blue Diamond on board...

508
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,113
that has brought
both luck and disaster."

509
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:28,951
If you like, just think of the three corpses
we're transporting on ice down below.

510
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,359
Cut out the doomsaying.

511
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:36,534
Cold? No wonder, since the thermometer
has dropped again.

512
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:40,493
- Excuse me.
- Of course. Your shift is over anyway.

513
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:44,390
Have fun at the party.

514
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,336
I'm passing up the festivities.
I have other plans.

515
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:08,992
Telegram, ma'am.

516
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:20,645
"Assets confiscated.
Property seized.

517
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:24,877
Gregor banished to Siberia.
Return impossible. Fyodor"

518
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,093
I'm going upstairs, Gloria.

519
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,456
It looks like you'll still be a while.

520
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,507
What's your hurry?

521
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,620
Are you meeting someone?

522
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,051
Not exactly.

523
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,512
I see.

524
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:40,381
Sigrid Olinsky?

525
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,676
What makes you say that?

526
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,943
I'm not blind.

527
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:47,441
I'm glad you brought it up.

528
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,949
You know what you mean to me.

529
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,465
But you have to understand my situation.
That woman is unbelievably rich.

530
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:58,112
Ah, the way out
you were looking for.

531
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,212
Please don't complicate this for me.

532
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,326
Why should I?

533
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:06,770
I assume it's only business, right?

534
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,243
Of course.

535
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:14,282
But what if it should have
to be more than that?

536
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,428
I'll let you know.

537
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:21,332
If our wedding is still on in New York,
I would ask you to do the right thing.

538
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,003
Please excuse the interruption.

539
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,704
I must make a request of you.

540
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,136
Gladly.

541
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,355
Oh, you're not allowed in.

542
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,312
Yes. Perhaps the smoking salon
would be suitable.

543
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:44,141
I'm sorry, but if you wish to speak to me,
you'll have to do so here.

544
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,583
Very well.
This matter is so important...

545
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:51,128
That you would even do
what is expressly forbidden.

546
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:55,950
Yes. Sometimes life is not
as easy as we think.

547
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:59,218
Well?

548
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,446
We've been sailing
through drift ice for hours.

549
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,290
There are even reports of icebergs.

550
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,914
I would ask you to convince
Ismay to reduce the speed.

551
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:10,698
May I ask why you come to me?

552
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,481
I have no other recourse...

553
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:18,657
and President Ismay is
obviously interested in you.

554
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,718
Obviously.

555
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:26,685
And you think he would do this for me?

556
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:32,106
No, I don't believe
he would do anything for anyone.

557
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:35,202
But he's a businessman.
He thinks in numbers.

558
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,423
And 20 million pounds
carries a lot of weight.

559
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:45,417
So, you're appealing not to me
but to my 20 million.

560
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:46,812
It's the same thing.

561
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,430
I didn't mean to upset you.

562
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:08,535
Well, you have.
You didn't mean to, I know.

563
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,795
You're too frank
and upstanding for that.

564
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:14,974
No, you meant it honestly,
and that's what upsets me.

565
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,161
The whims of a rich,
spoiled woman.

566
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,491
Atrocious, isn't it?

567
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:30,677
I'm afraid
I cannot grant your request.

568
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:33,387
Even considering what's at stake?

569
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,804
Madam, I beg you.

570
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,935
Herr Petersen, I cannot
help you anymore. Not now.

571
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,377
Thank you, madam.
I see I shouldn't have come.

572
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,783
I took you for a woman who merely had
the misfortune of being too wealthy.

573
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:52,686
A woman a man could love,
if things were different.

574
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,504
I was mistaken. Forgive me.

575
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:06,446
A woman a man could love.

576
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:14,893
Good evening, ma'am.

577
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,954
May I do your hair?

578
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:21,361
A woman a man could love.

579
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:23,797
How did you know, ma'am?

580
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,368
Is the news already out about Franzl?

581
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:28,067
About whom?

582
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,466
My Franzl.

583
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:32,378
Who is this Franzl?

584
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,196
The first violinist
in the first stateroom.

585
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,258
Did he say that too?

586
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:39,754
And how!

587
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,953
He said I was the only woman
he could ever love.

588
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,538
That he could ever love.

589
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,774
What cabin are you looking for?

590
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:57,308
Professor Bergmann's.

591
00:38:57,381 --> 00:39:00,640
Then you're in the wrong place.
This is Mr. Astor's apartment.

592
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:04,921
Professor Bergmann is in 27 and 28,
third door on the left.

593
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:42,807
Madam, I have an unusual request.
May I speak with you at once?

594
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:45,002
Speak with me at once?

595
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:48,060
May I wait for you
in the foyer of the ballroom?

596
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,830
What are you looking for?

597
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:05,511
Now I see why you flattered me
with such close attention.

598
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:08,113
You needn't have bothered.

599
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:11,489
What you're looking for is here,
in my head.

600
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,905
But one thing interests me:
Which of my rivals are you working for?

601
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:17,815
Come, out with it!

602
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:21,254
Who ordered you to bring them
my formulas and calculations?

603
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,096
Formulas and calculations?

604
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,938
Who sent you here?

605
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm alone. I work for myself.

606
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:34,047
How do you propose to prove that?

607
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,058
I'd like to ask you something.

608
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:41,758
I'm all yours.

609
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,265
First, a question:

610
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,718
Do you know we're sailing through
a region of dangerous drift ice?

611
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,666
Dangerous?

612
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,161
There is no danger for the Titanic.

613
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,333
Now get out of here. Out!

614
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,728
Who was that, Professor?

615
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:04,838
A burglar.

616
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,030
And you let him get away
just like that?

617
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,574
Stop. Come back here.

618
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,584
Just look at this.

619
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:18,778
Madam, I must ask you to assert
your influence on the president.

620
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:21,840
The speed of the Titanic
must be reduced!

621
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:23,062
Why?

622
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:25,600
For a day now, we've been sailing
through a region of drift ice.

623
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:29,248
But we're sailing at record speed
to win the Blue Ribbon for England.

624
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,615
Professor, this would be...

625
00:41:33,216 --> 00:41:34,946
This is the solution
to your year-long...

626
00:41:35,023 --> 00:41:38,176
Yes, the results of my
year-long calculations.

627
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:41,341
I wanted you to go over them,
and that rascal disturbed me.

628
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:44,157
Please help me double-check them.
It will only take a minute.

629
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,593
Once we're done,
we'll have good cause to celebrate.

630
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:50,556
Those are misplaced sentimentalities
that I cannot allow.

631
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,538
And if I were to make
a special request?

632
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:55,835
It doesn't matter if we arrive
in New York a few hours sooner or later.

633
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:58,931
Yes, it does matter.

634
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:02,161
Sir Ismay knows exactly
what he wants and what he has to do.

635
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:03,972
Perhaps not, madam.

636
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,935
If something happens, it's not just
good-bye to the world record.

637
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:11,416
The Titanic will be lost,
and the president along with her.

638
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,395
Don't talk such nonsense.

639
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:17,178
Why worry about things
that only concern the president?

640
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:21,350
A woman as beautiful as you
shouldn't worry about such things.

641
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:24,694
Sir Bruce Ismay,
a moment, if you please.

642
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,857
Mr. Astor?

643
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:31,333
I was just on deck.
The temperature is icy.

644
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,386
- But it's April.
- Correct.

645
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:36,609
And April is when the danger
from ice in this area is greatest.

646
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:39,985
You mustn't disturb
the passengers with this opinion.

647
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:43,948
I know you yourself would be quite
content if the ship had to sail slowly.

648
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:47,047
It is still very questionable
whether the world record will save you.

649
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,362
Let's wait and see.

650
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:50,062
I have to tell you something.

651
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,634
What?

652
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,442
I can't tell you here.
We have to be alone.

653
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,751
Fine. Let's go to the bar.

654
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,395
It's more comfortable there...

655
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:03,099
and we won't be disturbed.

656
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:06,887
Thank you, madam.

657
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:09,290
Even if you don't help me,
I know what I have to do.

658
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:10,823
Really? What?

659
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:13,597
I will warn the president
once again of the danger.

660
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,168
No need.

661
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,199
I already told you
the real reason for your pessimism.

662
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,595
I sorry I can't respond,
since I'm on duty.

663
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:23,508
Your duty will be over soon.

664
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,728
The White Star Line
has no need of officers...

665
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,090
who sow unrest among the passengers.

666
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,288
And I have no need to serve
on a ship run not by sailors...

667
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:33,170
but by stock speculators.

668
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:36,826
I forbid you to use that tone.
Go to your stateroom.

669
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:38,424
I'm relieving you of your duty.

670
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:41,647
On board this ship, you can neither
relieve me of duty nor give me orders.

671
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:43,978
To me you're nothing more
than a passenger.

672
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:17,285
And now the two of us will dance,
right, Marcia?

673
00:45:17,356 --> 00:45:20,307
No. She's going to dance
with me first.

674
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:22,634
Says who?

675
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:24,955
Says me.

676
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:26,389
Don't be stupid!

677
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:36,186
Pull them apart!

678
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:46,171
You have a knife.
Give it to me.

679
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,092
Take him away and lock him up.

680
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,940
And keep it quiet in here,
you understand?

681
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:07,126
Ice! Ice to starboard!

682
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:20,161
Starboard searchlight on!

683
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:35,696
Rudder hard to port!

684
00:46:39,288 --> 00:46:41,338
Damn it!
What's wrong with the searchlight?

685
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:42,961
Rudder is hard to port.

686
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,808
Where's the searchlight?

687
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:46,899
The filaments broke.

688
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:50,967
- Then get new ones.
- We don't have any replacements.

689
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:53,288
What?
No replacement filaments?

690
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,132
It doesn't matter. There!

691
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:14,291
It looks like we made it
through okay.

692
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:16,092
But we hit the ice.

693
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,883
Shouldn't we talk to the engine room?

694
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:23,739
They would have notified us
if anything serious had happened.

695
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:27,396
- I'm going below just in case.
- As you like.

696
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,338
- Did you feel some scraping?
- Yes, sir.

697
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,523
It could have been a fishing boat.

698
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:35,040
- They pop up often in this area.
- That would be bad news for them.

699
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:36,251
Excuse me!

700
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:40,949
We had a collision with underwater ice.
Is everything all right?

701
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:42,196
Yes, sir.

702
00:47:44,047 --> 00:47:45,991
Leak in the boiler room!

703
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:50,369
I'll inform the captain immediately.

704
00:47:50,444 --> 00:47:51,973
Stop engines!

705
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,655
Engines are stopped.

706
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:37,676
It seems to me
the engines have stopped.

707
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:48,908
Indeed, the engines have stopped.

708
00:48:48,981 --> 00:48:51,032
I'll go ask the captain
what's going on.

709
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:53,876
Good idea. Come on, everyone.
We're going to the captain.

710
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:34,552
What do you want?

711
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,882
- We'd like to speak to the captain.
- The captain isn't here.

712
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,655
There must be some officer here.

713
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:41,985
There's no officer here, either.
Now clear out.

714
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,827
Why do you want to talk to the captain?

715
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:46,405
We want to know
why the engines have stopped.

716
00:49:46,823 --> 00:49:48,625
See for yourself.

717
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:51,201
Ladies and gentlemen,
be very still for one moment.

718
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:53,074
Quiet!

719
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:03,156
He's right. The engines have stopped.
Please tell us what you know.

720
00:50:03,232 --> 00:50:07,083
You're too pessimistic.
We're damaged, but we can't go under.

721
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:11,912
The ship is ripped open
from the bow to past the bridge.

722
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:14,693
In two hours,
the propellers will be in the air.

723
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:24,184
Phillips.

724
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:28,253
Send this:

725
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:31,351
"SOS. Titanic damaged.
Urgently request help. Smith."

726
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:35,933
"SOS. Titanic damaged.
Urgently request help. Smith."

727
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:42,120
The lifeboats are to be readied
only on my order.

728
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,513
They're worried in the ballroom.

729
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:49,423
Yes, thank you.

730
00:50:49,776 --> 00:50:53,142
Petersen, you calm down
the passengers.

731
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:56,205
Tell them it was a maneuver
to avoid drift ice.

732
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:02,662
Gentlemen, to your stations.

733
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:15,559
Mr. Phillips, I have to send
an urgent telegram.

734
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,068
We're not accepting
private telegrams right now.

735
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:24,530
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You heard me.

736
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:29,708
But Ismay personally assured Mr. Astor
that his telegrams would have priority.

737
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:33,852
I'm not interested.
Now please leave. I'm busy.

738
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:40,522
Ladies and gentlemen, please give
your attention to the first officer.

739
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,186
Ladies and gentlemen.

740
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:47,301
The engines have stopped because
we are changing course and speed...

741
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,947
as a precaution to avoid drift ice.

742
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,632
There is, therefore,
no cause for alarm.

743
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:56,515
That includes all of you in steerage.

744
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:59,503
I would thus ask you
to return to your cabins.

745
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:11,044
It's about time.
I've been waiting for half an hour.

746
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:13,132
Sorry.
I had some pressing business.

747
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:15,004
- You may congratulate me.
- On what?

748
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,376
Imagine: The jewelry box
was stolen from Astor's cabin.

749
00:52:18,453 --> 00:52:22,447
- Congratulate you for that?
- No. Because I caught the thief.

750
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,883
Do you know who it was?

751
00:52:24,952 --> 00:52:29,848
My old friend,
Senor Cristobal Mendoz from Cuba.

752
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,770
What's that?

753
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,371
Where's that coming from?

754
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:41,566
A water pipe must have burst.
We should tell someone.

755
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,783
You're right.
A good reason to get out of here.

756
00:52:45,426 --> 00:52:46,635
Open up!

757
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:50,255
Have you got a connection?

758
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:54,524
Yes, the SS /duna is coming to our aid.
They've given us their position.

759
00:52:56,898 --> 00:53:00,998
I know the /duna.
She makes 13 knots tops.

760
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:03,568
That's much too far away.
It's pointless.

761
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:09,306
- They refuse to accept private telegrams.
- Ridiculous.

762
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:12,469
Ismay hopes to save himself
by cutting off communication...

763
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,271
but he's wrong again.

764
00:53:14,348 --> 00:53:17,405
520/0 of all shares
are now certain to be mine.

765
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:20,569
At an average price of 60.
A good bit of business.

766
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:23,035
Not just good, Hopkins. Great.

767
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,680
You can get everything ready
for our arrival in New York.

768
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:28,797
And one more thing:

769
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:31,616
Put my wife's jewelry case
in my luggage.

770
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:37,355
I found a few especially beautiful gems
I want to mount with the Blue Diamond.

771
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,651
A little surprise for my wife.

772
00:53:39,723 --> 00:53:43,434
By the way, where is my wife?
Still in the ballroom?

773
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:47,150
No. I last saw madam
with Lord Douglas in the bar.

774
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:50,290
You're mistaken.
I'm not unhappy.

775
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:53,347
Even if my husband
only thinks about business.

776
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,608
Even if I'm just an asset
on his balance sheet.

777
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:58,833
But you don't love him,
so you're not happy.

778
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:01,236
The happiness
you speak of is an illusion.

779
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:03,771
Passion never leads to happiness.

780
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:05,579
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

781
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,765
Then why have you led me on?

782
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:09,576
- Have I done that?
- Yes.

783
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:12,530
Perhaps you're right.

784
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:18,999
Maybe I did toy with the possibility.
But now I'm afraid of my own courage.

785
00:54:19,073 --> 00:54:22,545
Because you're afraid of
changing your life, of giving up luxury.

786
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,278
- Archibald?
- Yes?

787
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:27,687
You're beginning to bore me.

788
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:34,637
Get all passengers on deck
with their life jackets on.

789
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:37,039
Tell them it's a drill.

790
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:39,366
Lie to them as long as you can.

791
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:42,703
Don't load the lifeboats
until you hear the horn.

792
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:44,273
Women and children first.

793
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:47,983
Herr Petersen, you see to
the most important passengers personally.

794
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:49,558
Thank you, gentlemen.

795
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,216
Did you find the jewelry box?

796
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:57,925
No, it's nowhere to be found.
Jenny doesn't know where it is either.

797
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,471
In any case, madam was the last one
to have the jewelry box.

798
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:01,682
I see.

799
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,028
You sent for me, John?
Why?

800
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:08,357
Your jewelry box has disappeared.

801
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,615
Please leave us alone, Hopkins.

802
00:55:24,182 --> 00:55:25,733
What's wrong, John?

803
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:29,395
Please answer one question:
Who were you last with?

804
00:55:29,465 --> 00:55:31,231
Why do you ask?

805
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:32,859
With Lord Douglas?

806
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,344
That's what I thought.

807
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:39,855
What does that have to do
with the theft?

808
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:42,879
You must know
Lord Douglas is bankrupt.

809
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:45,201
Gentleman's debts, they call it.

810
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:50,242
Your recommendation didn't help him.
I didn't give him any money.

811
00:55:50,322 --> 00:55:52,265
I don't understand you.

812
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:55,841
Do you think Lord Douglas
is capable of stealing?

813
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,028
No, the jewelry hasn't been stolen.

814
00:55:58,109 --> 00:55:59,008
Then what?

815
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:02,589
The jewelry wasn't stolen.
It was given as a gift.

816
00:56:02,662 --> 00:56:03,729
What do you mean?

817
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:06,926
I mean you helped your lover
the only way you knew how.

818
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:13,046
Pity you couldn't have given me
this news five minutes earlier.

819
00:56:13,611 --> 00:56:14,890
Why?

820
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:17,982
It doesn't matter anymore.

821
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:22,926
All you know is your money.
Nothing else.

822
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:26,813
And with good reason.
Money is the only value I believe in.

823
00:56:27,307 --> 00:56:28,445
What is it?

824
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:32,446
Please put on your life jackets
and go up on deck.

825
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,015
Why? Has something happened?

826
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:36,195
No, the captain has ordered
a lifeboat drill.

827
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:39,368
Put on your life jackets
and go on deck. Please hurry.

828
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:44,296
Lifeboat drill?

829
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,927
Then I should go?

830
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,582
And you have nothing more
to say to me?

831
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:09,572
No. I don't wish to continue
this conversation.

832
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:11,412
Just leave me alone.

833
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:14,511
Please accompany my wife on deck.

834
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,730
On deck?

835
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,822
Yes. Please go.

836
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,921
Put on your life jackets
and go on deck immediately.

837
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,030
Why?

838
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,294
The captain has ordered
a lifeboat drill.

839
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:46,243
Is someone there?

840
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,720
Please put on your life jackets
and go on deck immediately.

841
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:51,775
On deck? Why?

842
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,347
I'm not authorized to give
the passengers additional information.

843
00:57:54,419 --> 00:57:55,734
One moment.

844
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:58,242
But you will give me information.

845
00:57:58,313 --> 00:58:01,465
As the man responsible for this,
I will give you information:

846
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:03,969
The Titanic is sinking.

847
00:58:07,107 --> 00:58:09,703
- What are you saying?
- The Titanic is sinking.

848
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:12,803
We collided with an iceberg.

849
00:58:12,877 --> 00:58:15,128
She's ripped open from the bow
to under the bridge.

850
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:16,236
Don't talk nonsense.

851
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,464
You'll soon see
whether it's nonsense.

852
00:58:18,543 --> 00:58:22,288
In just hours a few thousand people
will be on the bottom because of you.

853
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:24,239
But we have lifeboats.

854
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:27,371
The lifeboats will hold at most
a third of the passengers.

855
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:29,690
I order you to secure
a lifeboat for me immediately!

856
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:33,209
First, you can't give me orders.
Second, women and children go first.

857
00:58:33,282 --> 00:58:36,541
Third, I advise you to go
to your cabin and get your life jacket.

858
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,835
- Stay here!
- What else do you want?

859
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,553
Please, let's talk man to man.

860
00:58:42,946 --> 00:58:46,347
Forget about earlier this evening.
I was nervous and excited.

861
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,080
I beg you, get a lifeboat for me.

862
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,976
- You should have seen to the lifeboats.
- No! Be reasonable.

863
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,526
I'll give you five...
I'll give you $10,000! Save me a place!

864
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:01,497
We'll just see if I come along!

865
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:06,335
You! Always you!
Now you're screaming with fear.

866
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:08,320
You should have thought
about all of this earlier.

867
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:11,024
- Just leave me alone.
- Leave you alone?

868
00:59:11,105 --> 00:59:13,950
Now I should just leave you alone.
And what happens to me?

869
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,423
I don't know.

870
00:59:17,502 --> 00:59:18,887
You don't know.

871
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:26,185
What if something really happens?

872
00:59:26,782 --> 00:59:28,311
What if we go down?

873
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:30,148
Then it's all over.

874
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:32,163
The game is over.

875
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,014
Yes, the game is over.

876
00:59:35,646 --> 00:59:37,827
You've played long enough.

877
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:41,406
- But now I want to tell you...
- I said leave me alone!

878
00:59:42,703 --> 00:59:45,998
Now I should leave you alone.

879
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:48,259
But earlier I was good enough for you.

880
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,186
You've spoken of marriage for years.
You waited until I had no other chance.

881
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:55,071
But now I have the last chance,
do you understand?

882
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:56,843
Me and not you.

883
00:59:57,442 --> 00:59:59,029
I am a woman.

884
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:03,306
A woman!

885
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:05,365
And it's women and children first!

886
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:15,307
Men on the starboard side.
Women and children on the port side.

887
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,346
Hurry! Quickly!

888
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:50,554
All clear.

889
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,888
Women and children, line up.

890
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:04,245
Life vests will be handed out
on the steps.

891
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,357
Ladies and gentlemen, the ship's crew
has ordered a lifeboat drill.

892
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:38,004
Please put on your life jackets
and go up on deck.

893
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:41,263
Please follow the orders
of the crew members immediately.

894
01:01:41,342 --> 01:01:42,800
And please hurry.

895
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:49,430
- Is it really just a lifeboat drill?
- Please get a life jacket immediately.

896
01:01:50,034 --> 01:01:52,877
- Won't you tell me the truth?
- Yes, I will.

897
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,347
The Titanic is sinking.

898
01:01:56,812 --> 01:02:00,877
Aside from Ismay, you're the only person
who could have averted this catastrophe.

899
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:02,535
He would have listened to you...

900
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:05,153
and for once you could have used
your riches for good.

901
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:07,854
Now money means nothing.
Now it's just about survival.

902
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:10,151
But the sea is calm.
We'll just get in the lifeboats.

903
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:13,322
There are 3,000 people on board.
The lifeboats can hold a few hundred.

904
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:15,193
Understand what that means?

905
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:18,426
Yes, I understand.

906
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:23,575
This might be the last time we speak,
so there's something I want to tell you.

907
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:27,148
I'm not rich anymore.
I'm as poor as you, maybe even poorer.

908
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:30,348
I was happy to see you
again on board.

909
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:32,441
And I did speak with Ismay.

910
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:36,534
Now please tell me
where I should go.

911
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:38,970
Come with me.
I'll take you up on deck.

912
01:03:18,812 --> 01:03:20,684
- Come on!
- Go on!

913
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:16,516
- Come on, Henry!
- I have to find Bobby.

914
01:04:16,587 --> 01:04:18,352
Leave Bobby. Come!

915
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:21,451
I have to find Bobby.
Wait for me on deck by the lifeboats.

916
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,943
Bobby, where are you?

917
01:04:47,003 --> 01:04:48,354
Here, Henry.

918
01:04:48,428 --> 01:04:51,201
- Where?
- Here! Help!

919
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,003
The ship is sinking.
I'll get you out.

920
01:05:08,694 --> 01:05:11,017
I demand a seat in a lifeboat at once.

921
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:13,348
I am the wife of President Ismay...

922
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:15,601
and I demand to be allowed
in the lifeboat immediately.

923
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,173
Please, madam.

924
01:05:27,395 --> 01:05:29,338
We collided with an iceberg.

925
01:05:35,842 --> 01:05:37,857
- Has the orchestra assembled?
- Yes.

926
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:39,907
In street clothes,
with their life vests on.

927
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:42,787
That will calm the passengers.
Order them to play.

928
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:46,373
Eight ships are coming to our aid.

929
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:50,049
The nearest is the Carpathia,
but she's 68 nautical miles away.

930
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:51,658
Sixty-eight miles.

931
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:53,670
That's five hours.

932
01:05:54,439 --> 01:05:56,381
So it's hopeless. Thank you.

933
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:02,497
Clear to go!

934
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:04,409
Let's go!

935
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:08,444
Heave ho!
Let her down evenly.

936
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:23,630
Please come. Take my place.

937
01:06:27,357 --> 01:06:28,815
Sigrid.

938
01:06:28,992 --> 01:06:31,694
I'm staying. I'm staying because...

939
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:34,865
Herr Petersen,
to the captain on the double!

940
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,884
We'll see each other later.

941
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:10,877
Captain! Morlock!

942
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:12,789
There!

943
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:14,734
Flares!

944
01:07:17,344 --> 01:07:19,182
Stop the alarm!

945
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:23,591
Tell Phillips to establish
radio contact.

946
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,548
Phillips! Brede!

947
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,434
Ship off the port bow!
Try to establish radio contact.

948
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,558
See if you can pick up
anything from the ship.

949
01:07:40,843 --> 01:07:43,686
We can't pick up the ship, Captain.

950
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,505
She's probably an old freighter
without a radio.

951
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:52,684
Set off the emergency flares.

952
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:09,556
Have you gone mad? Since when
are white flares used as an SOS signal?

953
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,992
There are no red ones.
The carelessness here was such that...

954
01:08:13,066 --> 01:08:14,938
I forbid you to say another word!

955
01:08:15,013 --> 01:08:19,280
The main thing is they see something.
They'll understand.

956
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:25,645
Look. More flares.

957
01:08:28,953 --> 01:08:31,453
But they're white.

958
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:35,411
White flares are not an SOS signal.
You could have let me sleep.

959
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,704
Why shoot off flares
in the middle of the night?

960
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:40,484
According to our position,
that can only be the Titanic.

961
01:08:40,562 --> 01:08:43,477
They're celebrating the fact they'll be
in New York by noon tomorrow.

962
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:47,232
Let them have their fun.
We're holding our course.

963
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:58,525
They're taking no notice of us.

964
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,348
They're sailing away.

965
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:02,734
Now what?

966
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:06,764
Start up the alarm again.

967
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:09,794
And see to it that
the rescue operation goes forward.

968
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:17,710
John!

969
01:09:22,902 --> 01:09:25,674
Stay calm, Anne.
I'm here with you.

970
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,258
Stay calm!

971
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:07,323
Let's get in the next boat
in an orderly fashion.

972
01:10:23,283 --> 01:10:25,949
I expect something in return.
What can you offer me...

973
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:28,801
to rescue your company
and retain you as president?

974
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:31,378
Your life.

975
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:35,090
My life?

976
01:10:35,726 --> 01:10:37,005
Yes.

977
01:10:37,638 --> 01:10:40,660
The captain believes we'll sink
in less than an hour.

978
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:43,505
Space in the lifeboats is limited.

979
01:10:43,756 --> 01:10:46,008
I could arrange for you
to be taken care of.

980
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,003
I accept your offer.

981
01:10:50,952 --> 01:10:53,547
I rescue you,
and you guarantee to save me.

982
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,844
We'll work out
the details in New York.

983
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:01,897
I'd rather put it in writing
before we get in the lifeboats.

984
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:04,119
Very cautious of you.

985
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:05,818
- Would you do otherwise?
- No.

986
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:07,072
Mr. Astor!

987
01:11:09,757 --> 01:11:12,566
There's shooting going on up on deck.

988
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:13,988
Why?

989
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,255
It seems only women
and children can be saved.

990
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,723
Only women and children?

991
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:24,698
Yes, and any man who tries
to get in a boat is shot.

992
01:11:32,561 --> 01:11:36,721
Ismay, I sense you won't be able
to keep your end of the bargain.

993
01:11:50,984 --> 01:11:53,686
Maybe I'll find someone
whose place I can buy.

994
01:11:53,764 --> 01:11:55,387
Come. We're going up on deck.

995
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:59,248
I'll give you $150,000
for a place in a lifeboat.

996
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:01,437
It's useless.
Women and children will be saved first.

997
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,733
Don't be stupid, man!

998
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:06,690
We can pay.
I'll give you half a million.

999
01:12:06,765 --> 01:12:09,468
Here's some advice:
Get a life jacket and go on deck.

1000
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:29,246
Nice to see you again, Lord Douglas.

1001
01:12:29,325 --> 01:12:31,435
I hope you're doing well.

1002
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:32,973
Am I disturbing you, gentlemen?

1003
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:37,110
On the contrary.
I was about to look for you below.

1004
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:40,856
Allow me to return
your wife's jewelry case.

1005
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:45,795
How did you get this?

1006
01:12:45,872 --> 01:12:49,239
Mendoz took the precaution
of removing it from your cabin...

1007
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:52,541
and I took the precaution
of relieving him of it.

1008
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,119
So it was stolen.

1009
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:01,891
Then I really...

1010
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:10,861
You have the will to get through.
I know you'll make it.

1011
01:13:10,935 --> 01:13:12,322
And you, Professor?

1012
01:13:12,395 --> 01:13:15,026
If I were 20 years younger, perhaps,
but there's no point now.

1013
01:13:15,106 --> 01:13:20,522
My life's work is done.
Just see to it that it gets through.

1014
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:38,421
Well?

1015
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:43,329
The Frankfurt at 153 miles? No.

1016
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,049
The Olympic, 510 miles?
Hopeless.

1017
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,688
Not a chance.

1018
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:04,945
Please, madam,
we have to release the boat.

1019
01:14:06,378 --> 01:14:09,187
Please, the boat must go.
There's no time to lose.

1020
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:11,763
- Let's go.
- You have to stay here.

1021
01:14:16,737 --> 01:14:19,795
Hedy, what a sight!

1022
01:14:19,866 --> 01:14:22,189
Franzl gave me the coat.

1023
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:26,330
Ah, your Franzl.
And the officer brought you here?

1024
01:14:26,401 --> 01:14:27,823
Yes, ma'am.

1025
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:31,676
So we'd better make the most of it.
Bon voyage.

1026
01:15:18,925 --> 01:15:20,868
- Ready.
- Sigrid!

1027
01:15:23,827 --> 01:15:25,734
You're an amazing woman, my dear.

1028
01:15:25,982 --> 01:15:28,163
I would only have done it
for you, darling.

1029
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:31,468
You must get in the lifeboat
and leave the ship.

1030
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:33,202
No, I'll go only when you go.

1031
01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:35,048
As an officer I must stay to the end.

1032
01:15:35,123 --> 01:15:37,695
And in my capacity as officer,
I order you to get in the lifeboat.

1033
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:39,152
The people there need you.

1034
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:41,761
Keep them going until help comes.
I beg you! Go!

1035
01:15:42,598 --> 01:15:43,949
So you're ordering me.

1036
01:15:44,023 --> 01:15:47,247
Yes, and it's the most difficult order
I've ever given.

1037
01:15:47,326 --> 01:15:48,747
All right, then.

1038
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:49,851
I'll go.

1039
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,247
Lower the boat!

1040
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:45,993
I will use my influence to ensure...

1041
01:16:46,072 --> 01:16:49,130
that nothing untoward happens to you
as a result of this catastrophe.

1042
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:50,516
If I am saved...

1043
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:55,757
I believed nature placed you
and your people above me.

1044
01:16:56,327 --> 01:16:59,170
I followed your orders to the letter.

1045
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:02,303
But I was wrong, President Ismay.

1046
01:17:02,374 --> 01:17:04,839
You will do nothing to save me?

1047
01:17:05,502 --> 01:17:06,747
I cannot.

1048
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:12,695
I demand a place in the boat,
Captain Smith.

1049
01:17:13,532 --> 01:17:15,677
I demand a place!
You understand me?

1050
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:19,124
No need to scream, Ismay.
I'll see to it that you're saved.

1051
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,569
- Really?
- Yes, but not to follow your orders.

1052
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,935
To bring you before the Maritime Board
to answer for your actions.

1053
01:17:26,012 --> 01:17:27,469
Please.

1054
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:35,698
There!

1055
01:17:41,447 --> 01:17:45,262
Captain, the last lifeboat is off.
The passengers are all on the forecastle.

1056
01:17:45,513 --> 01:17:46,828
Gentlemen.

1057
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:51,416
You have done your duty.
I thank you.

1058
01:17:52,117 --> 01:17:53,848
You are now released from duty.

1059
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:16,370
People!

1060
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:19,509
You have done your duty.

1061
01:18:21,004 --> 01:18:23,469
Now it's every man for himself!

1062
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:43,488
Wait for me, Anne.
I'll find some life jackets.

1063
01:18:43,564 --> 01:18:46,516
Don't leave me alone, John.

1064
01:18:46,936 --> 01:18:48,808
Don't leave me alone.

1065
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:56,624
Every man for himself!

1066
01:19:12,764 --> 01:19:15,229
I'm sorry.
The last lifeboat has left.

1067
01:19:57,328 --> 01:19:58,679
Look there!

1068
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,532
It's Anne!

1069
01:20:15,682 --> 01:20:19,319
- Have you seen my Anne?
- She left long ago.

1070
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:21,167
- She left?
- Let me go!

1071
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:37,916
Tadrow!

1072
01:21:42,445 --> 01:21:43,903
What are you waiting for?

1073
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:37,531
Go now. I'll follow later.

1074
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:41,710
I'm the senior officer.
Don't make me get angry.

1075
01:23:02,882 --> 01:23:06,355
Go back.
You won't make it through there.

1076
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,229
Mommy!

1077
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:25,893
Don't be afraid, little girl.
I'll take you to your mommy.

1078
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,754
Stop. It's Petersen!

1079
01:25:56,063 --> 01:25:58,113
And that's how the Titanic sank.

1080
01:26:02,111 --> 01:26:05,512
Your Honor, you expressed doubts
as to the question of guilt...

1081
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:07,981
but there is no question here.

1082
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:09,889
There is only guilt...

1083
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,709
and one man alone
bears that guilt!

1084
01:26:13,513 --> 01:26:15,349
The president of the White Star Line.

1085
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,802
Order!
I thank the witness.

1086
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:22,611
The board of inquiry
will now retire for deliberations.

1087
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:30,572
Hey, there's the one
who lost his memory.

1088
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:39,197
John!

1089
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:59,702
Now we'll see if there really is
such a thing as justice.

1090
01:27:05,967 --> 01:27:08,218
After examining
all relevant questions...

1091
01:27:08,296 --> 01:27:10,134
including those of negligence...

1092
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:12,188
and of whether safety measures
were ignored...

1093
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,167
and especially those emphasized...

1094
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,564
in accusations and statements
made by the witness Petersen...

1095
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:19,234
the Board of Inquiry has reached
the following decision:

1096
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:24,423
On a ship, the captain alone
is in command.

1097
01:27:24,496 --> 01:27:26,925
In this case, therefore,
the fault for the accident...

1098
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,569
lies with the captain
and only the captain.

1099
01:27:30,092 --> 01:27:34,157
He can, however, not be called to answer,
since he is no longer among the living.

1100
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,125
Thus, no accusation may be lodged
against the White Star Line.

1101
01:27:40,138 --> 01:27:45,033
President Ismay's behavior
cannot be considered incriminating...

1102
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:48,439
and he is therefore acquitted.

1103
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:54,308
I hereby declare this Maritime Board
of Inquiry to be adjourned.

1104
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:07,732
"The deaths of 1,500 people
remain unatoned for...

1105
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:13,082
an eternal condemnation
of England's quest for profit."

1106
01:28:14,898 --> 01:28:17,707
THE END
