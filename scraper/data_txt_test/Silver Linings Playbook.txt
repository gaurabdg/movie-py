(MAN <i>1) What, are you kidding me?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.</i>
<i>The whole family is together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.</i>
<i>We're all watching the game.</i>
<i>Yeah, it drives me crazy.
And, yes, I was negative.</i>
You didn't even know I loved it, Nikki.
I just didn't appreciate it or you before.
(MAN 2) Come on. Time to go.
(PAT) I lost all that. I blew it.
But you also blew it.
We can get it back.
We're gonna get it back.
It's gonna be better now.
I'm better now and I hope you are too.
I'm gonna appreciate...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Be there in a minute.
(MAN 2) Doctor's waiting. Let's go.
I'll be there in a minute.
(SIGHS) That's true love.
(DANNY) That's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about hair too much.
It's the way I want it, but he cut it back.
He cut this side to even up.
Didn't tell him that.
I said, "Just cut the way you cut."
(PAT) Anything's possible.
I think if we get... We often get caught in this state of negativity.
It's a poison like nothing else.
You can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume liability in the eyes of the court.
And he's getting used to the routine here.
I don't want him to get used to the routine here.
Eight months is already long enough.
(PAT) Hey, Mom.
Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
What?
I don't understand.
Oh, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
I guess everybody leaving today.
Hello, Mrs S.
An honour to finally meet you.
Pat told me how God made you rich in character.
You're the mighty oak that hold the household together.
And not to mention the lasagne you make on game day when the Birds play.
Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
Bad combination.
On top of an anxiety disorder.
That's when I was an x-ray technician and I had my ADD and my anxiety.
I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it.
That's when my hair was long.
My hair only grew when I was older.
When I was younger, my hair didn't grow...
Remember my brother had a Jheri curl and I couldn't
because my hair didn't grow long.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
I was jealous of my brother, but wait.
Hello?
It looks great now.
You like it?
It's good now.
You're going the wrong way.
It's this way.
What?
Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.
All right, Mom, let's talk about this.
Mom, just listen.
Do not touch the steering wheel!
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
I'm sorry, Mom.
You OK?
I am out on a limb for you
with the courts right now.
It's my fault. Pat didn't know.
He's my friend so he's rooting for me.
I'm having a disagreement with the hospital. We're working it out.
Take me to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me.
You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.
Can we stop at the library? I wanna read
Nikki's English high school syllabus.
Mom, it's a good thing.
I'm remaking myself.
<i>(RAN DY) DeSean Jackson.</i>
<i>What happened to DeSean Jackson?</i>
Come on, tell me that one.
(PAT SR.) Insanity.
He spikes the ball at the 1-yard line, the 1-fucking-yard line. I mean, I...
Get into the end zone, dummy. I mean, he celebrates before he's even in.
You know something? Nothing new.
Your team does that all the time.
They get close and blow it.
They got an inferiority complex.
What are you talking about? What makes the Cowboys America's team?
Because we're America's team.
We're in Philadelphia.
What's the matter? You're a traitor.
What's more American than a cowboy?
You know what's more American?
Benjamin Franklin.
Benjamin Franklin?
Franklin, the founder of our country.
(RAN DY) With the glasses, long, scraggly hair?
(PAT SR.) What about the lightning?
He stood in the storm with a kite.
(RANDY) If he wasn't on a 100-dollar bill, nobody would know who he is.
Why do you got so many?
(PAT SR.) Don't touch.
(RANDY) I didn't even touch them.
Don't blame me.
(PAT SR.) Who did this?
Who took the remotes like this?
Did you do this, Randy?
(RANDY) I don't touch them.
I don't know why you need so many.
Hey! Ah, there she is.
Look how beautiful. Hey.
What?
What's this?
(RANDY) Hi.
Everything good?
(PAT) Mm-hm.
Well...
Where is it?
It's right here.
(PAT SR.) You got it. Ah.
Well, we don't want them to steal that.
You still got yours?
Yeah, I got mine.
So you don't talk to me?
Didn't tell me you took him?
Well, he's ready.
Didn't tell Dad you're picking me up?
Don't worry about that.
I wanna make sure you're OK and I...
She didn't say anything. Didn't tell me.
The court said yes. Don't worry.
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
Because the court listens to the doctor.
The court listens to the doctor...
Dad, Dad, Dad, relax.
The court said it's fine, OK?
Let it go.
(WHISPERS) Don't worry.
I'm there because of the court.
That's the agreement we made.
It was a plea bargain with the courts.
The lawyer instructed, he said we should plead that,
I serve eight months and get out.
(DOLORES) It's all under control.
Well, OK. OK, congratulations.
(PAT) Thank you.
So, what are you doing?
I'm gonna start a restaurant.
A cheesesteak place.
(PAT) How you gonna pay for it?
(PAT SR.) I'm gonna pay, don't worry.
From your bookmaking?
Who told you that?
Mom told me. Outside.
(DOLORES) No, I didn't.
You just told me outside.
Five minutes ago, you said:
"Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking."
Why, Dolores?
Why did you say that to him?
He has the wrong idea.
Everything's fine.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
(PAT) Good, Dad, good.
OK, the question is:
What are you gonna do with yourself?
(PAT) I'm getting in shape.
I'm getting trimmed, getting fit for Nikki.
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
You know, she...
Nikki sold the house. She left.
Didn't your mother tell you she...?
You don't know about my marriage.
Our marriage...
We're very, very much in love, OK?
Just like you two.
Listen, Patrick, she's gone.
She's not around anymore. Nikki left.
What are you doing, Dad?
You... Excelsior. Excelsior.
(PAT SR.) What does that mean?
It means
I'm gonna take this negativity and use it as fuel.
I'm gonna find a silver lining.
And that's no bullshit.
That's no bullshit.
That takes work and that's the truth.
What the fuck? Unh!
Stupid fucking book.
Can't believe Nikki's teaching that book.
The whole time. Let me break it down.
You're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with Catherine Barkley.
It's 4.00 in the morning, Pat.
And he does. He does. He survives the war after getting blown up.
Survives it and escapes to Switzerland with Catherine.
But now Catherine's pregnant.
Isn't that wonderful?
They escape into the mountains.
They'll be happy, and drinking wine and dance.
They both like to dance, which was boring, but I liked it because they were happy.
You think he ends it there? No.
He writes another ending.
She dies, Dad.
I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys.
Hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive?
"Let's have a good ending to the story?"
Pat, you owe us an apology.
Mom, I can't apologise.
I'm not gonna apologise for this.
You know what I will do? Apologise on behalf of Ernest Hemingway because that's who's to blame here.
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologise to us too.
Why didn't you run with me, huh?
I was reading.
Do us a favour, don't read for a while.
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
Gonna go run now.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Wait, you have to fix this window.
I'll fix it when I get back.
Now.
Get in the car.
You have to go to therapy.
I don't wanna go to therapy.
It's part of the deal.
You can't live with us and not go.
(STEVIE WONDER'S "MY CHERIE
AMOUR" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Is that song really playing?
We have music sometimes.
That song is killing me.
Could you please turn it off?
(RECEPTIONIST) I can't.
What do you mean?
Don't have the controls.
Sorry...
Did Dr Timbers put you up to this?
Is there a speaker here? ls the speaker here?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry.
I'll fix all this, OK?
That was a messed-up thing you did,
Dr Patel. I'm sorry, but that's...
(PATEL) You can call me Cliff.
Yeah, Cliff, that's not the way to meet people, OK?
Why don't you write that in...?
I don't know, a little book?
Sorry. I wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.
Bravo, it's a trigger.
I'm not gonna take meds.
You have to.
No, I'm not gonna.
It makes me foggy...
You have to.
I don't want to need meds.
I'm sorry. Look,
I am not the explosion guy, OK?
My father is the explosion guy.
I'm not that guy.
He got kicked out of that stadium.
He beat up people, he's on the exclusion list.
I had one incident.
But one incident can change a lifetime.
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.
She just needs to take responsibility.
What's hers?
What's hers?
Mm-hm.
Are you joking?
Well, let's go back to the incident.
I come home from work after I left early, which I never do, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the principal.
I come home and what's playing?
The song.
The song that you so charmingly played out here for us.
That's playing. I don't think anything of it. I should have.
<i>I come home, what do I see?
I walk in the door and I see underwear</i>
<i>and clothing, a guy's pants with his belt.</i>
And I walk up the stairs and I see the DVD player.
<i>On the player is the CD playing the song.</i>
And then I look down and I see my wife's panties.
<i>And then I look up and see her in the shower.</i>
I think, "That's sweet.
She's in the shower. Perfect.
<i>"I'll</i> go in. We never fuck in the shower anymore. Maybe today we will."
I pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history teacher with tenure.
(STEVIE WONDER'S
"MY CHERIE AMOUR" PLAYING)
And you know what he says to me?
<i>"You should probably go."
That's what he says.</i>
So,yeah,I snapped.
I almost beat him to death.
But I get chastised for it? And I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.
All right. Can you talk about something that you did before or after?
Week before the incident,
I called the cops and I told them my wife and the guy were embezzling money from the local high school, which...
...wasn't true. It was a delusion.
And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
Undiagnosed bipolar.
Yeah.
With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God.
And the shower incident happened, everything snapped, so I then realised that, "Oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life."
And without any supervision,
I've been doing it all on my own with no help.
And basically, I've been like white-knuckling it this whole time.
That had to be hard.
Yeah, it's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what is happening, which I do now. Sort of.
<i>(DOLORES) You have to take your medication.</i>
(PAT) I can't.
(DOLORES) I will call them.
They'll come for you.
(PAT) You wouldn't do that.
Why call them?
(PAT SR.) What's up?
(PAT) I don't feel good when I...
I don't feel good. I'm clear without it.
Makes me bloated.
I don't like the way it makes me look.
Just take the medication.
I'm doing it with my physicality.
Working out, that's what I'm doing.
Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
Why are you?
To sweat.
(PAT SR.) Sit down. Come on.
Seven minutes in, no score.
Help turn the juju around.
I don't believe in juju.
Come on, you wanna be positive?
Be positive.
Sit down. Come on.
(PAT) I'll watch the beginning of the game.
(DOLORES) You're good luck.
(PAT) What's in your hand?
It's a... It's...
See? Yeah.
(PAT) Handkerchief?
<i>(TV ANNOUNCER) And they give it to DeSean Jackson, takes it downfield.</i>
That's OCD. That's crazy.
What OCD? I want my son to watch with me, sue me.
No, just sit down. Come on.
I want you to watch the game with me.
I'm not superstitious.
A small thing that I do. If I make money what's the difference if I do this?
It's a small thing.
Sit down. Come on.
I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
Touchdown!
(ALL YELL)
Oh, whoa!
(PAT SR.) You see? You see that?
You're meant to be here. This is special.
Everything happens for a reason.
That's why you came home.
Embrace it. Embrace it.
(PAT) I'm the reason?
I don't think so.
(PAT SR.) Yeah, Tommy.
Tommy, yes, yes.
I got your whole sheet. Yup.
No, no. I'm just confirming. OK.
Wait, wait.
Can I do an interview
on mental illness?
No. Don't pay any attention.
Who was that? Rick D'Angelo?
(DOLORES) That's him.
Guy who's having the problem?
People are stupid.
Don't let them hurt your feelings.
Patrick.
(DOLORES) Pat, don't look for Nikki.
(PAT SR.) Get out of here with that camera.
Patrick, please.
Pat.
Patty. Patty.
Don't look for Nikki!
(ALABAMA SHAKES'
"ALWAYS ALRIGHT" PLAYING)
(PAT) Miss Metgers!
(METGERS) Oh, God. Oh, God.
Nance. It's my lucky day.
Look at you working on a Sunday.
How are you? Hey.
What are you doing here?
I just came by to say hi,
I'm ready to work.
You shouldn't be here.
Full-time, half-time.
I'll work, I'll sub,
I'll work history, whatever.
Let me give you a hand. Sorry.
I got it. I got it.
Let me ask you something.
Does Nikki still work here?
Can't tell you.
But Doug Culpepper is.
Why would you tell me that?
He broke up my marriage.
Are you being a troublemaker?
You look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?
I did. Yeah, I did. Thank you.
Aah! Get away from me. Get away.
OK, all right. I'm better.
I'm better now. OK, I'm better.
I feel so good. Look at my eyes.
Look how clear they are.
Don't hug me.
Not a complainer, I'm positive.
You have to give it time.
A lot went down.
People will get over it. It'll work out.
I'll take that as a silver development.
That's a silver lining.
Good luck.
Ronnie. Pat.
There he is. He's back.
Hey.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
Welcome back, man.
I'm out.
Yeah, you're "out" out? Cool.
You lost a lot of weight.
I didn't recognise you.
I'm sorry I didn't visit you.
Work's out of control.
You know, she had the baby.
I'm really glad you're back.
I miss you.
I really need someone to talk to.
Come see the baby. She's beautiful.
Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
Congratulations on the baby but I'm not buying the invitation.
Because you think Veronica still hates you?
I know Veronica still hates me.
That's not true.
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that
Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar
where she keeps his balls, her purse.
That's not true.
(VERONICA) What are you doing?
OK, it's a little true.
If you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she invite you to dinner, hm?
Did you invite him?
(RONNIE) Yes!
Well, can he make it?
I don't know yet!
Can you make it next Sunday?
Sure.
I'll see you next Sunday.
You are still in touch with Nikki, right?
Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
Yeah.
Get in here, please. I need you.
(RONNIE) OK.
As soon as you left, Redskins threw a trick play, a pitchout to Randal El.
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging, loses the challenge, the game.
You're in this house, show some respect for what I do.
And we should spend time together.
I'm keeping you out of trouble.
(PAT) I have very, very good news.
Very good news.
What's that? What's the good news?
(PAT) Things are looking up.
Oh, are they?
I knew why they invited me over.
I know.
She might be with that guy.
(PAT) Oh, no way.
No, she might be with him.
(PAT) No way, Dad.
She's afraid. She doesn't wanna talk.
Doug Culpepper?
Put the phone down. Please.
What are you doing?
(PAT SR.) Stop.
Look, look... Dad, Dad.
This is my life.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone. Gotta understand me. You wanna go back?
Stop this. Don't do this.
Don't yell at me like that.
Well, then don't behave this way.
I got a call to check on this house.
Pat Solatano? Yeah?
Mrs Solatano, Mr Solatano,
I'm Officer Keogh.
I heard about the restraining order.
You went to your old house, school.
It's not OK.
I've been assigned to your case, you'll see a lot of me.
Do yourself a favour. Respect the restraining order. Five hundred feet.
You hear what he just said?
You have a restraining order.
Yeah, I know.
Thank you.
If you need anything, my card.
Thank you. Sorry. We understand.
Since when do cops have cards?
Tell me, would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital? Hm?
So take your medication.
If you do fine, we'll reduce them.
Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape, get my life in order, then she's gonna be with me.
And that's better than any medication.
Pat, there's a possibility,
I want you to be prepared for it, she may not return.
True love is about letting her go and see if she returns.
Meantime, if you listen to that song,
I don't want you to fall apart.
So get a strategy, OK?
You need one.
Let me say... Gonna say something.
OK.
This is what I believe, this is what I learned in the hospital.
You do everything you can, work your hardest.
And if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
Work on a strategy, OK?
All right.
My friend Ronnie is having this party on Sunday, and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife Veronica's a real stickler for...
Mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey
Jake got me from the Eagles.
Which jersey?
DeSean Jackson.
DeSean Jackson is the man.
Well, that settles that.
(RONNIE) Pat! What are you doing?
I gotta go, man.
Why?
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have worn this.
I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.
Are you comfortable?
Veronica's not gonna like it.
Guest of honour.
Come however you wanna come.
Really?
Get over here.
DeSean Jackson's in the house.
You mean rookie of the year?
(RONNIE) Yeah.
DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.
Isn't it awesome?
Not for dinner.
Look, he got us flowers.
Oh, aw, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat.
That's lovely. Hey.
And wine.
Check this out.
We just redid the whole thing.
Wow. Tremendous.
Isn't it great?
Yeah. I'm thinking of redoing it again.
Why?
You're making a lot.
We're doing all right. I can't complain.
Isn't the market down?
It is.
But she wants more so I'm giving her more, man.
My dad lost his pension.
Sorry. A lot of people. My uncle too.
Really?
No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike.
You start snapping up commercial real estate, cheap.
You flip it over and that's when you make the money.
But the pressure. Man, it's like...
You OK?
(WHISPERS) I'm not OK.
Don't tell anybody.
Listen to me.
I feel like I'm getting crushed and...
(WHISPERS) Crushed by what?
Everything. Family, the baby, the job.
The fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know...
Like, I'm trying to do this, you know, and then I'm, like, suffocating.
Holy shit.
You can't be happy all the time.
Who told you you can't be happy?
Do your best, you have no choice.
Not true at all. Ronnie, Ronnie.
You just can't.
I hope you're OK with Veronica's sister coming over. OK with that?
Who?
Veronica's sister.
Tiffany and Tommy?
Tiffany. Yeah. Just Tiffany.
What happened to Tommy?
He died.
Tommy died?
Cops die.
How'd he die?
Don't bring it up.
No, how did he die?
How did who die?
Hey, Tiffany. This is Pat.
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm not flirting.
I didn't think you were.
I see you made an effort.
I'm gonna be better with my wife.
I wanna acknowledge her beauty.
I never used to do that.
Gonna do that.
We're gonna be better than ever, Nikki.
Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?
What about your job?
I just got fired, actually.
Oh, really? How?
I mean, I'm sorry.
How'd that happen?
Does it really matter?
Baby, how's it going?
(VERONICA) Everyone having fun?
Oh, baby, can we show them the house?
Please, please, please.
(RONNIE) The whole house?
(VERONICA) Yeah. It'll be fun. It'll be fun. We're gonna go on a tour now.
Let's go see the house.
(RONNIE) Let's go for the tour.
(VERONICA) I've been planning this forever. I love our house.
I'm really excited about it.
Come on.
(VERONICA) Guess what it is.
(PAT) Oh, it's a television.
It's a computer screen.
(RONNIE) Nope.
Keep going.
A brick oven.
It's a light.
Oh, warmer.
It's a drawer where they pull out dead bodies, shoot them with formaldehyde.
Where would the body go though?
It's a joke.
It's a fireplace.
In the middle of the wall?
We have a port in every room.
Who doesn't have an iPod?
I don't have an iPod.
I don't have a phone.
They won't let me.
They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
Don't worry about it.
I would call Nikki.
I'm gonna give you one of my iPods.
Give me your iPod.
Give it to me. Thank you.
(TIFFANY) Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in,
I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
I can play music in any room.
Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
("BRAHMS' LULLABY"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.
Ask him about any president, knows them all.
Here's a fun fact. You know where the term OK comes from?
(VERONICA) No. No, <i>I</i> don't.
Where?
Martin Van Buren, eighth president of the United States, is from Kinderhook.
He was part of a club, a men's club called Old Kinderhook.
And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK."
In the Old Kinderhooks.
Really?
(PAT) Pretty cool, right?
(RONNIE) Interesting.
Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years. She's real good at it.
She'll be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
Really? Nikki loves dance.
Why do you have to talk like that?
I'm bragging about you. Can I brag?
Don't talk about me in the third person.
(VERONICA) Give me a break.
I'm right here.
(VERONICA) Just be nice. Just be nice.
Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.
I know. I know. I know.
What meds are you on?
Me? None.
I used to be on lithium, and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no.
They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but
I agree, I wasn't as sharp so I stopped.
You ever take Klonopin?
Klonopin? Yeah.
Right?
Jesus.
Like, "What? What day is it?"
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
How about trazodone?
Trazodone?
It flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.
It takes the life right out of your eyes.
God, I bet it does.
I'm tired. I wanna go.
(VERONICA) No, no, no. We haven't...
We haven't finished the salad yet or the duck...
I made fire and ice cake.
I said I'm tired.
Are you gonna walk me home or what?
You mean me?
Yeah, you. You gonna walk me home?
You have poor social skills.
You have a problem.
You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.
I tell the truth. You're mean.
What, I'm not telling the truth?
Um, maybe I should drive them home?
No, you can drive them both home. Now.
Stop talking about me in third person.
You love it when I have problems.
You love it because then you can be the good one.
No, I don't. I don't.
I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
(TIFFANY) God.
(VERONICA) What is your problem?
Nothing's my problem.
I'm tired, I wanna go.
(VERONICA) You really wanna go?
I really wanna go.
It's been great.
The baby is sleeping.
Sorry, I don't wanna wake up the baby.
(RONNIE) Sorry, man.
(TIFFANY) This is me.
I haven't dated since before my marriage, so I don't remember how this works.
How what works?
I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.
You felt it, I felt it.
Don't lie.
We're not liars like they are.
I live in the addition, separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us.
I hate that you wore a jersey because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, OK?
How old are you?
Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
I had a good time tonight.
I think you're pretty, but I'm married, OK?
You're married?
So am I.
No, that's confusing. He's dead.
Wait, what? What's happening?
Oh, my God.
Hey.
(LED ZEPPELIN'S "WHAT IS AND
WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE" PLAYING)
Are you OK? Ronnie called.
That makeup on your shirt?
I don't know.
Whoa. What happened?
When am I gonna get a phone?
In due time. What happened?
Pat.
(PAT WHISPERS) Mom, Mom. Mom,
I can't find my wedding video.
Mom, wake up.
What is it?
It's after 3.00, what are you doing?
(PAT) I looked in here, but this is all your shit. You put it up here?
(DOLORES) What about in your father's study?
Don't go in my study.
Dad, not now. Would you put it in here?
Makes no sense.
What are you doing?
He's got all his Eagles videos.
Is it here?
(PAT SR.) Patty!
(DOLORES) It's probably in the attic.
Are you going in my study?
It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
You think I can't handle it?
Please stop yelling.
I'm not yelling, I'm just frustrated!
I should have my wedding video!
Pat, you're gonna wake everybody up!
I already looked all over there.
(DOLORES) Calm down.
I'm not calming down!
I don't give a fuck! I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up!
I'm not ashamed of it!
Let the whole neighbourhood wake up!
I don't care! No, Mom!
(DOLORES) Stop it! Stop it!
What's going on?
(DOLORES) Lower it down!
What? Hey.
It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!
(DOLORES) Pat, stop it, stop it, stop it!
(PHONE RINGING)
(DOGS BARKING)
I can't watch a video? No!
I can hear the fucking song in my head!
(SOBBING AND
MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)
(DOLORES) <i>Stop!</i>
(PAT) Mom?
What the fuck you doing?
You throw your mother on...!
(PAT) No, no.
Stop it!
(PAT) Get off me, Dad.
(PAT) I'm not doing...!
Stop hitting him!
Patrizio, don't hit him!
I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!
(PAT) Stop it, Dad!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
Police. Open the door, please.
Open up.
Mr Solatano, I got a lot of calls.
People are scared. I gotta come in.
How are we doing in here, huh?
A lot of reports from your neighbours.
We got phone calls...
Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.
Hey, sit down.
(PAT SR.) Stop with these crazy theories.
He's a cop. What are you doing?
It's a medication problem, but he's fine.
Wanna send him back to Baltimore?
We know about the explosion.
What explo...? No. Cliff is lying.
He's not allowed to talk about that.
Jesus Christ, who's that?
(PAT SR.) Keep an eye on him.
Is this a bipolar episode?
Get out of here, little fucking idiot.
Someone help me!
You can't tell Nikki about this.
I had to make out a report.
Hey, sit down.
Listen, sir.
(RICK) This guy's chasing me!
Help Me!
(KEOGH) Sit down.
I could write a letter...
She has a court order against you,
500 feet... Listen to me!
I'll take that camera and I'm gonna break it over your head.
I'm gonna interview you, what it's like to get that camera broken over your head.
What are you laughing about? Sorry.
(ROSALIE) I'm sorry.
(MAN) Stop all that fucking noise.
Go back to sleep, the party's over.
Show's over.
Not a reflection of where I'm at.
You can't tell her.
You can't tell Nikki.
Pipe down.
Everything all right?
Who was that, Dad?
(PAT SR.) That kid with the camera.
Good luck. I gotta write this up.
(PAT) Come on, don't write it up.
(PAT SR.) It's OK, everything is OK.
We're fine.
Thank you, we appreciate it.
Thank you.
Hey!
Whoa! Hey.
What the hell?
What happened?
Weight lifting accident.
(TIFFANY) That sounds like bullshit.
WhY'd You run by my house?
Did our conversation get you upset?
This is my route. Just back oh'.
My neighbourhood.
You ran by my house.
I like to run by myself, OK?
Me too.
I like to run alone. Stop.
What?
I'm running here.
Me too.
Run somewhere else.
There's tons of roads to run in.
I like this road, my neighbourhood.
Come on, please!
Calm down, crazy.
Why are you...?
Damn it.
(TIFFANY) Hey!
What the fuck?
I'm married!
So am I!
What are you doing?
Your husband's dead!
Where is your wife?
You're crazy!
I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital.
I'm not the big slut!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.
There's a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself.
Can you say the same about yourself, fucker? Can you forgive?
Are you any good at that?
Trouble last night.
Let me just set the record straight.
Hurting my mother was a mistake.
I hate myself for it.
I hate my illness, I wanna control it.
My father had no trouble slapping the shit out of me, which I did not return because I could've killed him.
He's 65.
Don't think I could've beat him?
He was scared for your mother and you hurt him.
Yes, last night was a mess.
And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
Pat, you have to have a strategy,
I told you earlier.
Recognise these feelings. Otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore.
So when you get these feelings, you get to a quieter place with peace with yourself, however you can.
Yeah, that's easier said than done.
You have no choice.
Excelsior.
Yeah, excelsior.
Listen, I have a letter
I want you to give Nikki, OK?
No.
Why?
Because you have a restraining order.
What good are you, man?
Why did you have this urgency to see your wedding video?
Because I'm married,
I haven't seen my wife.
Maybe you think Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl.
Get drawn towards Tiffany, you'll spoil your chances of getting Nikki back?
Not bad, Dr Jones.
I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
Why is she a slut?
After the dinner, she said, quote,
"We can go to the back house and you can fuck me
"as long as we turn the lights out," unquote.
And she still wears her wedding ring.
So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
Maybe she needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself, and can I say the same?
Can you?
Is that...? You're ask...?
You're really asking me that question?
Yes.
With all my crazy sad shit?
Are you nuts?
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
I'm just giving back your words to you.
This crazy sad shit, as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful, positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out
and reading books.
No. No, not the books.
You said Nikki is friends with Ronnie, Veronica, Tiffany.
If you become friends with Tiffany,
Nikki will think you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person who helps people in need, who is basically thriving.
So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
(GIRL 1) Trick or treat?
(BOY) Trick or treat?
(GIRL 2) Trick or treat?
(TIFFANY) Hey!
(PAT) Whoa!
How do you know when I run'?
I wanted to clarify something.
I just want us to be friends.
Did you hear what I said?
Why are you giving me such a hard time?
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
(TIFFANY) I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.
You wanna have dinner at this diner?
Pick me up at 7.30.
(THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET'S
"UNSQUARE DANCE" PLAYING)
(CHILDREN) Trick or treat?
(BOY 1) Wait up!
(BOY 2) Ooh, I got a king-size.
Happy Halloween.
Hi.
(LES PAUL & MARY FORD'S "THE
MOON OF MANAKOORA" PLAYING)
(WAITRESS) Here you go.
(TIFFANY) Thank you.
Gonna get a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
(WAITRESS) Great.
Tea.
Be right back.
(PAT) You look nice.
Thanks.
(WAITRESS) Raisin Bran.
Here's some milk for you.
Thank you.
(WAITRESS) Mm-hm.
(CRABCORPS' "MONSTER MASH"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Do you wanna share this?
Why did you order Raisin Bran?
Why did you order tea?
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
Because I didn't want there to be any mistaking it for a date.
It can still be if you order Raisin Bran.
It's not a date.
So how's your thing going?
Dancing thing.
Good. How's your restraining order?
I wouldn't actually call the restraining order my thing, but getting back with Nikki is, and I think I'm doing pretty well.
Except for a minor incident.
And the so-called incident with the weights.
Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.
I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor.
And I could just explain it and let her know I'm actually not out of control.
And that I'm actually...
I'm doing really well.
I can get a letter to Nikki.
I see her sometimes with my sister.
(AMBRCDSIA PARSLEY & THE ELEGANT
TOO'S "GOODNIGHT MOON" PLAYING)
It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
(WHISPERS) But you would do it?
I'd have to be careful.
I'm already on thin ice with my family.
You should hear how I lost my job.
How'd you lose your job?
By...
...having sex with everybody in the office.
Everybody?
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.
We don't have to talk about it.
How many were there?
Eleven.
Wow.
I know.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
OK.
Can I ask you one more question?
Were there any women?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
What was that like?
Hot.
Jesus Christ.
Was it like older women, a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you...?
Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.
What? You sat on her lap?
Mm-hm.
She told you what to do?
Mm-hm.
Oh, my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a perv.
Maybe we should change the subject.
I don't mind it.
You don't, do you?
No.
But then people were getting in fights in the parking lot at work and in the bathroom.
And the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me.
So I accused him of harassment.
And then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
I get it.
The song that was playing when my wife
was in the shower with the teacher.
Heard about that.
My wedding song.
When I hear it, I go kind of crazy.
Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
Wow.
Yeah.
So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
Yeah.
So I know.
(TIFFANY) Mm-hm.
I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
Me too.
Better get back to the letter.
Let's get back to the letter.
What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
Yes.
Yes, that could work. I love that.
I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.
Can I at least finish my tea?
What?
My tea. Can I finish it?
Wait a minute.
Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?
Why would she do that? Was it a test?
I kind of got that feeling, yeah.
Goddamn it. I knew it.
It was a test. How did I do?
I think I did pretty well.
She said you were cool, basically.
Basically?
Was I some percentage not cool?
No, she said you were cool, but, you know...
No, I don't know.
Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.
What do you mean? How am I?
What does that mean?
Sort of like me.
Sort of like you?
I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
Why?
Because it...
It's just not right.
Lumping you and I together, it's...
I mean, it's just wrong, and Nikki wouldn't like that.
Especially after all the shit you just told me.
You think that I'm crazier than you.
(CHUCKLES) Because...
We're different, I mean...
Oh, my God.
Ugh. You're killing me.
You know what?
Forget I offered to help you.
Forget the entire fucking idea.
Because that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
Keep your voice down.
I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
Forget it! Fuck you!
(PAT) Shut the fuck up.
(TIFFANY) You shut the fuck up.
(PAT) Tiffany. Tiffany.
(MAN 1) Hey.
(MAN 2) Go get her, man.
Slow down, Raisin Bran.
(PAT) Hey. Hey, come on. Look,
I don't think you're crazy, all right?
Yes, you do. You told your therapist you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
Hey, calm down.
Just leave me alone.
Can I just explain myself? I didn't want
Nikki to think that I was associated with that behaviour because I've never done that.
You may not have experienced the shit that I did, but you loved hearing about it, didn't you?
You are afraid to be alive.
That's...
You are afraid to live.
You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist.
You're a liar.
I opened up to you and you judged me.
You are an asshole.
You are an asshole. Get off of me.
Calm down.
Get off! You're harassing me!
He's harassing me!
Shut up!
Get off.
Man, take it easy.
Dude, relax.
He's harassing me.
(PAT) Get off me, dude.
He's harassing me!
Stop it. Back off, all right?
Calm down! Go home.
Get off of me.
Shut up, shut up. Stop it.
Shut up.
(STEVIE WONDER'S
"MY CHERIE AMOUR" PLAYING)
(PAT) Hey, hey, get off me.
What are you doing?
Come on, what are you doing to these kids?
You being a punk with these kids?
Wanna go back to Baltimore?
Is that what you wanna do?
What did these kids do to you?
You're begging to go back to Baltimore.
What's the matter?
You're sick.
It's the kids. It's the kids.
Honestly, he didn't do anything.
It was all the kids.
They started it. He didn't do anything.
(KEOGH) Come on.
Come here. What are you gonna do about that song? Huh?
Gonna go your whole life scared of that song?
It's a song. Don't make it a monster.
Come on, breathe. There's no song.
There's no song.
There's no song playing.
That's it.
That's it. Do it more. There you go.
(KEOGH) Move it out. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
(KEOGH) Where are you going?
(TIFFANY) I took it too far.
Hey, was he messing with you?
No, this was just a joke.
This is a joke I started.
There's a restraining order on this guy.
That's not a good thing to do.
I'm fucked up. What can I tell you?
You're Tommy's widow?
I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
You're a funny girl.
You wanna get a drink sometime?
What'd I say?
She doesn't do that anymore.
(PAT) I'm sorry about what I said.
(TIFFANY) I know.
You didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.
(TIFFANY) I know you say shit you don't mean all the time.
I'll still give your letter to Nikki.
Don't worry.
Wow. Oh, I really appreciate that,
Tiffany.
(TIFFANY) I know you do.
(PAT) You do?
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you tomorrow?
With the letter?
(RANDY) I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.
Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of them took it.
That's the only answer.
No, no, no.
Dolores. Somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?
Somebody took an envelope.
Maybe we should call the FBI.
No, don't make fun. It's serious.
We'll take a look.
I'll show you what this is.
I'm gonna explain to you something.
You know what I'm doing, honey.
This is everything... I got this.
It all corresponds...
Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.
No, it's not OK.
"Do not go in my study or I will eat you."
(PAT SR.) It's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for?
Dolores, you are so beautiful.
Stop that.
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.
A lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games, a lot of cash in them so show some respect for what I do.
I wanted to tell you the number.
Envelope was empty. Didn't wanna wake you, needed an envelope.
You didn't wanna wake me?
He didn't wanna wake me.
Doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest Hemingway.
He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding video.
Making crabby snacks, homemades.
Come on, be nice.
Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad.
What are you...?
What are you so up about?
(DOLORES) Very happy.
I'm happy.
(PAT SR.) You're so up.
(PAT) Isn't that a good thing?
You're just up.
I don't know what that is.
Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?
Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.
Taking a little too many or something?
If I was taking that, I'd be on the floor.
Stay. Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.
Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.
What do you mean?
You mean OCD superstitious time?
(RANDY) Come on, your dad needs a winner.
Come on.
I can't.
It's the Seahawks.
Put on the jersey and stay, please.
Please. It's important, please.
(DOLORES) What are you up to?
Nothing.
What's in the envelope?
Yeah, what...?
What's in that envelope?
I'm beating the song.
I'm on the scoreboard.
I'm playing downfield. I feel great.
Tiffany.
Hey, hey, how you doing? ls Tiffany here?
What do you want?
(FATHER) That another creep?
What do you want, creep? Beat it.
No, I'm married.
Married creep.
I'm her friend. We go running.
Have you guys not seen?
(MOTHER) She's not here.
How's it going? Hey. ls Tiffany home?
Go away.
I know her. I know her.
We've dated. We still date.
I've called her, texted her.
I haven't heard back.
Used to work together...
I just wanna give you my card to give to her.
What's he saying?
He's saying you're being rude.
How am I being rude?
You know.
Sometimes it's OK with girls, they wanna have fun.
Sometimes it's not, they got a broken wing, they're an easy target.
In this particular case, I think that that wing is being fixed, my friend.
Make sure it gets mended.
You're getting in the way of that.
She's sensitive, smart, artistic.
This is a great girl.
Be respectful to that.
Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.
She just texted me.
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a second.
What are you doing? What happened?
You weren't outside.
I can't... I can't do it.
What do you mean?
I can't give the letter to Nikki.
Tiffany, what are you talking about?
What do you mean, can't give the letter?
Because what am I getting in return?
You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.
Because I do this. Time after time,
I do all this shit for other people.
And then I wake up and I'm empty,
I have nothing.
You seem like you're a tough girl to me.
You do things on your own.
I always get myself in these situations.
I give everything to other people and nobody ever...
I don't get what I want, OK?
I'm not my sister.
All right, well, ask for you.
What can I do for you?
I... I can't do it.
Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
Think of something.
There's this thing.
There's a thing.
OK, what kind of thing?
It's a thing. It's a thing.
It's a dance thing.
Dance thing, all right.
Competition at the Franklin Hotel.
Tommy would never do it.
Tommy's dead, he's not gonna fucking do it.
I don't have a filter when I talk.
(TIFFANY) Can we have one conversation without you reminding me?
OK, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
But I can only do it if I have a partner.
I'm about to miss it for another year.
I'm not gonna dance.
What are you talking about?
Your schedule is busy? <i>Grapes</i> of Wrath and watching football with your dad?
I'm not gonna do a dance.
I'm not giving your letter.
You promised you would do this.
Think about it.
I already did do something for you.
What did you do for me?
Took care of that jerkoff at your house.
What? Jordie?
Let me ask you, you call him when you're lonely?
That encourages him. Shouldn't do it.
Say the same about Nikki?
Not at all like me and Nikki.
We're in love and married. It's different.
How are you in love?
Tell me about that.
The big Nikki love. Tell me about it.
I wanna understand it.
We have an unconventional chemistry.
Makes people feel awkward, but not me.
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever been with.
Wow.
It's electric between us.
Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal. Couples wanna do that.
I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, stop acting so superior to me.
She wanted me to lose weight, stop my mood swings, which I've done.
People fight. Couples fight.
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.
She wanted the best. She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate.
That's a good thing. I'm my best self today and she's her best self today.
Our love's gonna be amazing.
You're gonna be amazing and she's gonna be amazing.
You're not gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back.
So think about the dance thing.
(TV ANNOUNCER) --went on a roll.
<i>McNabb got not in the first half, nine consecutive...</i>
<i>(PAT) You're out of the hospital?</i>
And you're here on game day?
I'm out. (LAUGHS)
It's official. They didn't convert me to Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two-thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out.
They had to let me go.
I never understand what he's saying.
OK, jailhouse lawyer, come back, sit down the way you were before.
(CHUCKLES) What a treat!
(DANNY) Let's do it.
(PAT) Dad's got you sitting here?
He calls me "jailhouse lawyer."
Hold the remote the way you were.
(PAT) Now you're holding the remote?
It's working. Your dad's a genius.
Now, sit up.
And Danny's good luck?
Danny's from you.
This is your house so it comes down to you.
You're the one, Pat.
(PAT) Superstition, Danny.
Come sit down. Don't disappear doing
God knows what with Tiffany Maxwell.
Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?
Oh, she's a mess. Gotta be careful.
She does a lot of therapy.
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
I'm saying...
(PAT) Am I messed up?
Stop judging. You're the one who has a messed-up marriage.
I'm just looking out for you.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
At his house, it's like a circus there.
Not gonna hide this.
You need to deal with it.
Stop breaking my balls.
I got you... I brought the iPod.
Oh! Whoa.
For me?
Yeah. That's my old iPod, but...
Buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you.
Wow.
Thirty-two gigabytes.
How many songs is that?
You got the Stranglers.
You love the Stranglers.
Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
Got some Clash.
<i>Oh, West Side Story.</i>
It makes me peaceful.
West <i>Side</i> Story?
# Just met a girl named Maria #
And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage.
(WHISPERS) Metallica, Megadeth.
I start fucking smashing shit.
Get your marriage together.
Breaking shit.
And I hurt my hand and I...
Ronnie, that's fucked up.
It makes me feel better.
It's like my therapy.
With Nikki,
I'm never gonna do stuff like that.
(MAN) Whoa, Nikki?
What's all this about Nikki?
Restraining order's nothing to fool with, bro.
Holy shit, look at you.
You are ripped.
You look absolutely amazing.
You feel good?
How you doing, Jake?
You look like Schwarzenegger. Shit.
Didn't I say you wouldn't recognise him?
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital.
Those places creep me out and the firm's been expanded.
Been helping Pop. He needs a legitimate business. He needs a tax return.
The money he's making, they're gonna come after him.
And it looks like I'm gonna make partner at the firm.
I don't even know what to say to you anymore.
You lost your wife,
I'm getting engaged.
I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things.
You lost your house,
I'm getting a new house.
You lost your job, things are great for me at the firm.
Stop talking about stuff that's good for you.
Leave it alone. Leave it alone.
We're watching the game.
You know what?
I'm just gonna stop talking.
I'm gonna shut my mouth.
As my friend Danny would say:
I got nothing but love for you, brother.
(DANNY) That's right. That's right.
(RAN DY) That's nice.
(RONNIE) That's nice.
Thank God, finally.
(PAT) DeSean Jackson.
Yeah. Did it fit?
Yeah, wore it to Ronnie's.
Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.
Veronica didn't like it.
Veronica hates the jersey.
Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, OK?
Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
You're up to something.
People like Tiffany, or Danny or me, we know something you don't know, OK?
Maybe we understand something because we're more...
We have a sixth sense.
Everybody got it. Just not in touch.
How you doing, Pat?
Jesus.
Sixth sense forgot to tell him cops were coming.
I'm taking him back to the hospital.
What? He passed, right?
First of all, check with the latest legal development.
Got a call that they did convert you to
Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline.
Wait a minute.
Are you an Eagles fan or are you not?
(KEOGH) I'm an Eagles fan.
What's the problem?
He's not going anywhere.
Let him finish the game.
Handkerchief is working.
We're killing the Seahawks, 27-10.
What's the matter with you?
Let him stay, please.
Don't know what you're talking about.
I'm glad the Seahawks are losing, we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, all right?
He can contest his case from Baltimore.
(DAN NY) Not correct about the Mental
Hygiene Law. You're not correct.
You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
(TIFFANY) Used insurance money to build this. I designed it.
Wow.
All the floors are hard oak.
It has good bounce for dancers.
I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun.
Walls are good, I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
Where do you sleep?
Upstairs.
It's a garage, I just renovated it.
Thinking about putting a ballet barre...
When are you gonna give it to her?
What?
The letter to Nikki.
Probably tonight.
Really?
Ronnie, Veronica and I, we'll see her tonight.
I changed the first paragraph.
I did this thing about Shakespeare, and maybe if she wanted to go dancing,
I can be able to do that.
Good.
I assume you're a good teacher.
Yeah.
You can teach us both.
And I also mentioned how you were...
How generous it is, what I'm doing for you.
Mm-hm. Really generous.
Being of service.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
To your need.
All right, start simple.
Start at that corner, walk towards me.
Walk across the room.
Can we do something besides dance?
Are you kidding me'?
Want me to fix something?
Deal is a deal.
I know, OK. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
(TIFFANY) Why don't you...
...walk towards me like I'm Nikki?
The only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk.
By your slow walk. You can't talk.
Not doing it.
Only walk. Do it.
No. That's stupid.
No walk, no letter.
Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.
Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
(MUMBLES) You're not Nikki.
Don't look up until you're halfway here.
That's right.
Not yet.
Yes.
Do you feel that? That's emotion.
I don't feel anything.
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
No.
We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him.
But for the last couple months,
I just wasn't into sex at all.
It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed.
Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids.
I have a hard time taking care of myself.
I don't think that makes me a criminal.
Anyway, one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going.
And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tyre and he got hit by a car and killed.
And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat.
That's a feeling.
(BOB DYLAN & JOHNNY CASH'S "GIRL
FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY" PLAYS)
OK, this is the waltz.
I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
Whoa, slow down.
What?
Your father wanted you to have this.
Wants me to have
Eagles information.
(DOLORES) It's his living.
Um, tell Dad thanks.
Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.
Football stays out of this place.
So does Lord of the Flies.
(PAT) What are you doing?
I'm behind on my syllabus.
(TIFFANY) I don't give a fuck.
(PAT) What the hell are you doing?
Hey, hey!
Did you throw that outside?
You're not gonna read that on my time.
<i>I can tell you about Lord of the Flies.</i>
It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch, a shell, and whoever has the conch has power and can talk.
You don't have the conch, don't have power.
Then there's a little chubby boy,
Piggy, and they're mean, and then there's a murder.
I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.
Who's that?
Hello? What the...?
What are you doing here, man?
If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, your whole adjudication is thrown out.
(PAT) How'd you know we were here?
(DANNY) Your parents.
Danny, Tiffany. Tiffany, Danny.
Pat told me about you.
Is this the girl you wrote about?
(PAT) Yeah.
You wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?
He wrote about you.
What did he say?
(DANNY) You was helping each other out and you were nice.
And you had a mouth on you, but...
Whoa, OK, OK.
(DANNY) A little mouthy.
Tell me more about what he said.
I'll just tell you.
It was just a very general letter.
Cool.
(DANNY) She's fine.
She is my friend with an F.
A capital F. She's fine.
For "friend."
Mm. Can I see what you guys are doing?
Yeah.
One, two.
(DANNY) I like it, I like it.
Do you?
(DANNY) It's good, yeah.
And then this goes into something else.
That's it?
What is it? What is it? What is it?
Can I say something?
(TIFFANY) No.
You sure?
Just say it.
I think, Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
Let me show you what I mean. You gotta come with a little bit more soul.
You should move some more hips.
Pat, come in like this.
OK.
Yeah. Can you move a little bit more hip?
That's it. Move a bit more.
You could turn around too.
Yeah. You're pretty good.
Yeah. Exactly.
(STEVIE WONDER'S "DON'T YOU
WORRY 'BOUT A THING" PLAYING)
Yeah.
OK, we got it, we got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.
I'll switch with you.
Come on, Pat. Come on.
A little bit more soul, Pat.
Black it up, Pat.
What's that mean?
(DANNY) You know what it means.
"Black it up"?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man. I got an idea.
(JESSIE J'S "SILVER LINING"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Jump up. Hold hands. Circle around and around and around.
Don't look back.
Come get some, Pat.
(PAT) Is that it?
(DAN NY) That's it.
Bounce, bounce. Shuffle back, shuffle, shuffle.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
You gotta move your junk.
Pop. Pop your butt. Pop it.
I gotta get out of here.
Gotta see this girl, Tanya.
Yeah, go see Tanya.
OK, man, hey.
I'll be there. I want you to win.
Excelsior, Pat.
(PAT) Excelsior.
That's my man. Let's go.
<i>(PAT SR.) Patty.</i>
Patty.
Hey. Patty.
Pat.
Huh? Patty.
Where have you been? Huh?
We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.
We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into division, any chance of playing in the playoffs.
Do you realise that?
Ahem. I didn't realise that.
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.
I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good-luck thing that you're in.
OK.
Yeah?
Right.
Hm?
I just wanted to, uh...
Maybe I didn't spend enough time with you growing up.
I spent too much time with your brother.
It might've made you feel worse about your behaviour, but I didn't know anything.
I didn't know how to handle it.
That's what all this Eagles stuff is about.
It's about us spending time now.
I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet.
That's the whole point.
Yeah.
I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things.
So, look, will you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now, huh?
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.
He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything.
The money he needs for the restaurant,
he's betting on the Giant game.
(PAT SR.) Tell him why.
Because he believes in you.
Is that true?
(PAT SR.) I believe in you, Patty.
I believe in you.
I want you to know that.
So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.
You understand?
(PAT) Yeah.
Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother.
Want me to go to the game with Jake?
I do.
Does he want me to go?
Of course.
He told you that?
He told me, yes.
With his friends?
With his friends. He trusts you.
He's not embarrassed?
No.
I'd love to go to the game too, but I'm banned from the stadium.
I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
Listen, personally,
I think it's a stupid bet.
Randy.
I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
(PAT SR.) Randy. I just hope you heard what I said.
It's like a family business, it's our family endeavour.
We all stick together on this.
That's how it works.
That's a positive, positive vibe.
I made a commitment about a project, and we have an important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, so...
I... I'm...
It's... And it's good for me, Dad.
It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's...
Never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.
What is this thing you're doing?
Yeah, what is it?
What is this project, hon?
(PAT) It's a dance thing, OK?
There's nothing more to it, Dad.
I swear.
Listen, I need to ask you something.
Tomorrow, can I spend half the day with you?
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't ask.
Why?
These are the two days that you have promised me and we have prepared to nail the big move.
It's not ready yet, we don't have the move.
My dad opened up, and it was beautiful and I wanna be of service to him.
He's worried the juju is being fucked up because I'm spending time with you.
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
You're not messing it up, the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
Guess what.
What?
Nikki replied to your letter.
But you can't read it until after you nail the big move.
Go.
(SIGHS)
I can't do anything else till I can read Nikki's letter.
It's in the back of my head.
We don't almost have it, all right?
(TIFFANY) I just hope you can handle it.
Thank you.
What was her energy when she gave it to you?
She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
She was scared? About what?
Did she tell you?
Try to stay positive.
I'm just gonna read it out loud, OK?
Because if she says anything that's...
Is that too much to ask?
No.
I thought you were gonna read it.
OK. I'm sorry.
"Dear Pat." Ahem.
"It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as you can imagine,
"but I'm glad you took the risk of getting it to me through Tiffany.
"This gives us a chance to communicate
"while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.
"I admit you sound terrific and I'm happy you're feeling positive
"and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were.
"I was moved to read about excelsior and your belief in happy endings.
"I'm moved by your act of love to read books I taught.
"I'm sorry you find them negative.
"They're great works that reflect how hard life can be.
"They can help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life.
"In spite of these developments,
"if it's me reading the signs,
I need to see something
"to prove you are ready to resume our marriage.
Otherwise, I find myself thinking that
"we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately.
"Don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it.
"I'm glad you're doing so well.
Love, Nikki."
I think I'm done today, OK?
She said to show her something, Pat.
This dance can be that something.
You would've never done something like this in a million years.
It shows all kinds of skills on so many levels, focus, collaboration, discipline.
It's romantic, like I said it would be.
It's for her.
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?
(CROWD) E-A-G-L-E-S!
Eagles!
<i>(PAT) Can I use your phone?</i>
Is it an emergency?
Yeah, kind of.
What kind of emergency?
I'm doing this project with Tiffany. I wanna tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl.
I'm... She's...
I'll just borrow Jake's phone.
Too bad you can't come, but I know you were kicked out, beating everybody up.
Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
That a bad thing?
No, I think it's a good thing.
Don't drink, don't hit anybody.
You'll be fine.
Yeah. I'm solid.
(THE WHITE STRIPES'
"HELLO OPERATOR" PLAYING)
This is my brother Pat.
How you doing? Pat.
Pat, what's this I hear about you just getting out?
Yeah! From the loony bin!
Guys, what the fuck?
I talked to you about that.
I told you.
It's all right.
He's a good dude. He's a good dude.
(ALL) Yeah!
Oh, shit. The Asian invasion.
Every week.
(MAN 1) That's right, fool. We got this.
No.
(JEFFREY) You better get your brother.
(MAN 2) Cuckoo bird's taking off.
(MAN 3) Cuckoo bird!
Dr Patel.
Hey, Pat! Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
We must beat the Giants.
Not supposed to see you.
Outside the office.
Is that illegal?
I'm your brother in green, not your therapist.
I'm happy to see you.
Wonderful that you are here.
This is Cliff. My doctor.
Two things. Watch that bubble screen for Manning in the backfield and make sure we knock the receivers on their ass.
You can say that again.
Those cocksuckers!
(RARE EARTH'S "HEY BIG BROTHER"
PLAYING)
I don't have her phone number.
If you really want, you can call
Veronica because she does,
but I don't wanna.
(PAT) Why?
Because she brings me down!
She brings me down.
You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some love there.
You guys have a thing that got broken.
You gotta fix it like a chiropractor.
Gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
Enough with awkwardness!
I don't wanna not be able to say what I wanna say.
You're right, you're right.
Whoo! Eagles, baby!
Yeah! Let's go! Whoo!
What the fuck? What's that smell?
What the hell?
(MAN 1) Nasty Indian curry.
This is America, baby.
Go back to your country.
Get out of here!
What's wrong?
(MAN 2) Hey. Hey-
What's going on?
(JAKE) Stay back, Pat. Stay back.
Leave the fucking Indians alone.
Tough guy.
(MAN 1)A traitor.
Stay here. Stay here.
I'm not gonna go in.
They're cool!
(MAN 1) Let's go!
I'm not gonna fight,
I'm not gonna fight.
(MAN 1) We're the real Eagle fans.
Not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!
(MAN 1) Come on, get him!
(PAT) Get off my brother!
(GUARD) Break it up or you'll be arrested!
(MAN 3) Pat. Pat. Pat.
What'd you do? What happened?
(PAT) Dad. Dad.
What happened?
The Birds lose, I lose a fucking fortune.
A fortune to Randy.
What did you do? You fucking lost it.
You said you had it together, you were solid.
I am solid. I was solid at the game.
I'm solid. I'm solid.
You fell apart!
What are you talking about?
It's all fucking ruined now.
It's all ruined.
It's all ruined!
(PAT) No, Dad.
It's ruined! It's ruined!
(PAT) No, Dad.
You little fucking shit!
(PAT) Come on, Dad!
You fucking loser! You loser!
(PAT) I'm not a loser.
You fucking loser! Spiked the ball...
(PATEL) He defended his brother and us.
Spiked the ball at the one-yard line.
(PAT) No, Dad.
(PAT SR.) Who is this?
We need to talk now.
When you make a commitment, it is not cool to not show up!
Wait. I tried to call.
My God.
Who is this?
(PAT) I tried to call you, Tiffany.
(TIFFANY) Oh, really?
(PAT) I was gonna split my time with my dad and you.
Dad was pulling me in one direction.
Sounds great.
That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help.
I'm Tiffany, by the way.
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
(PAT) No craziness.
I told you I was doing this thing.
(PAT SR.) When you started spending time with her, it fell apart.
This is the reason right here.
Think I fucked up the Eagles' juju?
Ever since.
Ever since he was with you. Since...
Think I'm why today's happened?
(PAT SR.) You are why today happened.
I'm why today happened?
(PAT SR.) I think so.
Let's talk about that.
Be my guest.
The first night that Pat and I met, the Eagles beat the 49ers handily,
40 to 26.
The second time we got together, the Phillies beat the Dodgers
7 to 5 in the NLCS.
(JAKE) She's right.
Next time we went for a run, the Eagles beat the Falcons, <i>27</i> to 14.
The third time we got together, we had Raisin Bran in the diner.
Phillies dominated Tampa Bay, fourth game of the World Series, 10 to 2.
(PAT) Oh, wow.
Let me think about that. Wait a minute.
Why not think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, 14 to 7?
He was with you?
(TIFFANY) He was. We went for a run.
There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day.
And if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.
Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of New York is on the official seal of the state of New York?
Anybody? Do you know?
No.
Excelsior. Look it up.
(ALL) Oh!
(PAT) What?
(TIFFANY) Yeah.
Excelsior.
(DOLORES) Oh, Pat.
Not that I give a fuck about football or your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs,
I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "excelsior" to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
(RONNIE) Unbelievable.
Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
I did my research.
(BOTTLE CAP POPS)
Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
(TIFFANY) Thank you.
Yeah. I gotta rethink this whole thing.
I didn't trust her before, but I gotta say, now I do.
Oh, now you like her, Dad?
I have to say I do. Yup.
(RANDY) Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?
You made the bet,
I won a lot of money, and now your whole family is in turmoil.
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.
You live for this.
You've bet against my father for years.
You're twisting the knife now.
You get off on it!
That's not true. Don't say that.
Fine, then prove it!
Yeah, prove it.
(RANDY) How do you want me to prove it?
How do you prove it'?
How do I prove it?
A chance to win back everything.
Double or nothing.
No, no, no.
Double or nothing on the Bengals next week, is that what you're saying?
(TIFFANY) Mm-mm.
Against the Cowboys.
(ALL) Oh!
(RANDY) Oh, come on, are you kidding?
(RONNIE) That's his team.
(TIFFANY) That's your team, isn't it, Randy?
I know who his team is.
(RANDY) When is the game?
December 28th, last of the season.
(PAT) Oh, my God.
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs
Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
(DOLORES) Oh, God.
Randy.
Don't you believe in America's team?
Yeah, don't you believe in America's team?
I believe in America's team.
But if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
I like it.
(DOLORES) No. No, Patrizio.
I believe in the Eagles, my son.
I'll take the action. I'll take it.
(PAT) Dad.
Patrizio, don't. It's toxic.
I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house.
Dad.
Not in New York. In this house.
Dad, I didn't know excelsior was the motto of New York.
But now I know.
This is toxic.
Dad, this is toxic.
You shouldn't be doing this.
Quiet, you already did enough.
What do you say?
My Birds, Benjamin Franklin's team, favoured one and a half points.
Give you 3 more.
Patrizio, stop it.
Randy, don't you take the bet!
In fact, I'll give you 10 points.
No, Dad!
Dad! This is insanity!
Dad!
Take that bet on the Cowboys.
(RANDY) Dolores, will you stop him?
Jesus!
(PAT SR.) Yeah.
How could you not take that bet?
Even with 10 points.
That's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards.
I bet you're such a coward, you won't take the 10.
Plus, whatever their score is at the dance thing. What's that?
What's that?
No, no, no.
You're crazy to give away that many points. I won't take that.
However, wait a second.
I do like the idea of a parlay.
What? No parlay! No.
No, don't do it. Don't do it.
(DOLORES) Mother of God.
How do they run this dance competition? How do they score it?
I don't know how they score.
We're participating, not a part of it.
There's people...
This is a high-end dance contest.
Do not put it as part of the parlay.
They go by Philadelphia rules.
Each dancer is scored 1 to 10,
10 the highest, average the four judges' scores.
OK, scores from 1 to 10, right?
And you guys are how good?
We suck.
We don't suck.
Pat's a beginner, I'm OK.
We're happy just to be going.
The people you're competing against?
They're good.
Some of them are professionals.
(RANDY) Better than you?
A lot better.
(RANDY) A lot better.
If I was to say you only have to score 5,
I'd be really very generous, right?
No, no.
That'd be amazing if we got 5.
Let's not get...
We can get a 5. Give me a break.
We can't get 5.
Give me a break.
You'll get a 5. You'll get a 5.
(TIFFANY) We can do a 5.
What?
(RANDY) That's the parlay.
Will somebody explain me the parlay?
Win two bets or lose the whole thing.
For Pat Sr. to win,
Birds gotta beat the Cowboys, plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a 5 at the dance.
(PATEL) That's very, very manic indeed.
(RONNIE) That's the parlay.
(RANDY) We'll shake on it.
(TIFFANY) Shake on it.
(DOLORES) No! Oh, God.
(RANDY) It's a bet.
I'm not gonna be a part of this.
Randy, you're a fucking sickness,
Randy. I'm out.
Pat, you can't quit.
I'm not doing the dance.
Calm down. Think about...
(PAT) See you later.
Pat, no. Pat.
What are you doing?
I'm out.
(RONNIE) What?
Here we are again at the one-yard line.
DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
There you go.
What does that mean?
That connection with DeSean Jackson, it doesn't matter anymore.
Just because I have the jersey on.
I'm not gonna do it.
You are not a stand-up guy right now.
If it's me reading the signs...
You reading the signs? Oh, OK.
(DOLORES) Pat! Pat!
You are not a stand-up guy!
Uh-oh.
(DOLORES) I told you not to push it.
(PAT SR.) He's gotta do this.
He can't be a quitter.
He cannot be a quitter.
You took that stupid parlay thing.
Now he won't do the dance. It was very constructive for him. You ruined it.
Only one way to get him to show.
What's that?
What's that?
We have to tell him
Nikki's gonna be there.
(DOLORES) She won't come.
We have to tell him she's coming.
We have to tell him.
That's a lie.
White lie.
White lie.
That's no big deal. So it's a little lie.
No other way.
(DOLORES) No.
We gotta leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
No. I don't approve.
You can't do it.
Well, you know, I didn't approve when you told her where he was running so she could ambush him.
I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this.
That's it.
We're gonna tell him
Nikki will be there.
You gotta be part of it.
We have to do it.
(DOLORES) Aren't you nervous to be lying?
No.
A little bit.
But it's for the best.
(PAT) "But if it was me reading the signs..."
<i>l---</i>
That's it.
OK.
Hey.
(PAT) Hey, what's up?
Sorry I'm late.
It's fine.
(FRANK SINATRA'S "HAVE YOURSELF A
MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS" PLAYING)
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
This isn't working.
Stupid!
(PAT) Come on, it's gonna be great.
Nikki's gonna be there, you know?
Everything's gonna come together.
It's what's meant to be.
You OK?
Well, don't get wobbly on me.
I'm not.
We have a dance to do, a parlay.
Stay focused.
I'm focused.
Good, let's go.
Look at the dancers. You see them?
Shit.
(PIERO PICCIONl'S "AMORE A FORZA"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?
Dallas just tied it with a field goal, 3-3.
(JAKE) I'm worried about the bet.
Don't worry about the bet.
Holy shit.
<i>Is this Dancing with the Stars?</i>
Well, you knew that.
Maybe you should've scouted them.
(RAN DY) Look at those fucking dancers.
You can give me the money now, you know.
Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a 5.
Watch the game with me.
The Birds are better
when Pat is with me, we settled that.
Stay for...
(PAT) Relax, we're gonna be fine.
I'll see you up there, OK?
Hey, Pat, Tiffany.
(PAT) Hey.
Glorious, beautiful occasion.
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'll see you.
All right, wish me luck.
(PATEL) Excelsior.
What's this?
I thought you were doing it.
I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance anyway, for God sakes.
You OK?
I want you to remember everything, all of the good stuff that we have here.
(PAT) Of course I do.
Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.
Good evening.
(MAN) Evening.
(PAT) Check in.
(MAN) Please.
(PAT) How many dancers are there?
(TIFFANY) What? Nikki?
Nikki.
Oh, Jesus.
(VERONICA) Let's get over here.
Come on.
What the fuck?
Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
(WHISPERS) You're killing me.
She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
(RONNIE) Pat told me.
He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window.
He did not say that.
(RONNIE) Yes.
Said it several times. It's his chance.
You gotta give him a chance.

Bartender.
Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?
So you want another one?
Sure.
So, what do you do?
(MAN) I'm a lawyer.
Litigator, actually.
Oh.
The scores for Santos-Aguilar...
The arguing guy.

For an average score of 7.3.

Seen her?
Find her.
I know. Mom, I know.
Sorry. Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
(MAN) She's fine, buddy.
She's fine?
Why don't you shut up, OK?
How many drinks have you had?
Two vodkas.
I don't know what choices you've made, but deal with it. We're in this.
We're in what?
(EMCEE) Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.
I used to think you were the best thing that happened, but now I think you might maybe be the worst thing.
I'm sorry that I ever met you.
(PAT) Good for you.
Come on, let's dance.
(EMCEE) And the scores for Nakarov and Tretiak are 6.7, 8.1,
7.5, and 6.5.
For an average score of 7.2.

Got it.

Come on, Pat!
Damn.
Let's go, Patty!
Come on, Pat.

(EMCEE) All right, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.
We have a 4.9...
...4.8, a 4.9.
That's too bad, guys.
That's a lot of 4's.
And a 5.4.
For an average score of 5.0.
(WOMAN) Sorry.
(MAN) Sorry about that, guys.
What? Come on!
(PAT) Dad, did the Eagles win?
The Eagles won, 44-6.
They won, 44-6.

Why are they so excited about a 5?
Great. Good job.
(TIFFANY) Thank you.
You were amazing.
(JOHNNY MATHIS' "MISTY"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
(PAT) Thank you for coming.
(NIKKI) Of course.
(PAT) How are you? You OK?
I'm good. How are you?
I'm good. Thanks.
You looked happy out there.
Did I? Who'd have thought, dancing?
Yeah.
You look incredible.
Thank you, yeah.
You lost a lot of weight.
Been reading your books,
I have a positive attitude.
I'm on medication and I'm in therapy.
Where's Tiffany?
She left.
What do you mean?
She left.
What do you expect?
Where is she?
I know you don't wanna listen to your father.
You gotta pay attention to the signs.
Life reaches out a moment like this, it's a sin if you don't reach back.
I'm telling you, it's a sin. It'll haunt you the rest of your days like a curse.
You're facing a big challenge in your life now, this very moment.
That girl loves you.
I don't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure doesn't love you right now.
I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.
I love you, Dad.
(PAT) Hey!
Would you just leave me alone?
Wait a second!
I have one more letter for you.
Give it to her yourself!
You don't ever have to see me again if you just read it, all right?
This is so fucked up.
Yeah, just read it.
"Dear Tiffany...
"I know you wrote the letter.
Only way you could meet my crazy.
Was doing something crazy yourself.
Thank you.
I love you.
I knew it the minute I met you.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up.
I just got stuck.
Pat.
I wrote that a week ago.
You wrote that a week ago?
Yes, I did.
You let me lie to you for a week?
I was trying to be romantic.
You love me?
Yeah, I do.
OK.
<i>(PAT) The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.</i>
<i>And I can't begin to explain that.</i>
<i>Or the craziness inside myself and everybody else, but guess what.</i>
<i>Sunday is my favourite day again.</i>
<i>I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like a very lucky guy.</i>
(PAT SR.) We have to beat the Vikings by 3. I'm giving you a 6, which is very generous after the beating you just took.
What are we talking about here?
Do another parlay if you make it to the next round.
We are gonna make it to the next round.
(JAKE) Did you-? <i>I</i> laid that down.
(RONNIE) No.
No, that was me.
No, that was me.
(JAKE) No, I played the jack.
Put the breadcrumbs, the garlic in the steak,
and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
Yeah. For maybe three hours, plus.
(PAT SR.) Everything's good, everything's good.
I got you, you're all down.
Randy, he's complaining. He lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning.
The restaurant's happening because of Randy so everything's good.
