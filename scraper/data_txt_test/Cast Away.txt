Time...</i>

<i>Not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk,</i>
<i>Russian, American, beings from Mars.</i>
It's like a fire. It could either destroy us or keep us warm.
That's why every FedEx office has a clock.
Because we live or we die by the clock.
We never turn our back on it.
And we never, ever allow ourselves... the sin of losing track of time!
Locally, it's 1:56.
That means we've got three hours and four minutes... before the end-of-the-day's package sort.
<i>- That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...
[Translating]</i>
Before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster... tries to put us out of business.
Hey, Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai, good to see you.
How are you, kid?
Look what you did.
You just delivered your very first FedEx package.
That deserves something special, like a Snickers bar... and a C.D. Player.
And something to listen to... a C.D. There.
Elvis Presley.
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.
You all recognize this, don't you?
I took the liberty of sending this to myself.
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.
You're probably wondering what could be in here.
What could it possibly be?
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?
Is this the new wallpaper for the... for the bathroom?
<i>[Translator Continues]</i>
It is... a clock, which I started at absolute zero... and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.
From Memphis, America to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.
Eighty-seven hours is a shameful outrage.
This is just an egg timer!
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheck?
<i>- Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?
[Translating]</i>
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.
The cosmos was created in less time!
Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours!
Fortunes made and squandered.
[Translating]
<i>What?</i>
What are you saying about me?
I tell them, what do they expect?
This man, when his truck broke down, he stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery.
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.
And I got my packages delivered, and that is what you people are gonna have to start doing.
You have to start doing whatever it takes, because in three hours and two minutes... every one of these packages has to be on the big truck... and on its way to the airport.
<i>- [Bell Rings]
Fifteen minutes!</i>
Crunch time! Crunch time!
Crunch time!
Let's go! Every package on the airport truck.
Go!
Crunch, crunch, crunch!
We have a big problem.
What?
The truck in Red Square is stuck.
What do you mean?
It's stuck.
Stuck how? In snow? In ice?
It's stuck! The most important truck... the Kremlin truck! Many packages.
All right, all right, all right.
Let's put the table right here.
We'll just do the sort.
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.
Right here.
Two lines, two lines.
One to the airport truck, one to the Moscow truck.
Got it?
C.D.G., F.E., M. E,
Memphis on the airport truck.
Everything else right there.

Otherwise leave a message after the tone. Thanks.

[Chuck]
Hello, Kelly. Are you there?
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. You're not there.
<i>You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin' the sorts in the middle of Red Square...</i>
<i>in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.</i>
<i> I miss you  </i>
I miss you
I really wanna kiss you
I'm outta here in two minutes and
I'm pickin' up the sweep through Paris, so I should be back in Memphis about 18 hours or so.
That's the good news.
The bad news is...
I gotta go to the dentist this week.
I got something in there that's hurtin'.
I love you and I'm gonna see you soon, and you know what that means.
Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!
[Speaking French]
[Knocking]
I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight.
Can't help you.
Try U.P.S.
With this extra head wind, are we gonna be able to push it and make the sort?
We'll do our best.
"Our best," huh?
Gwen, is there something wrong with our doctors thatJack keeps getting certified to fly?
Aren't you concerned?
I'm terrified.
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless!
What do you expect from the guy who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...
when his truck broke down?
I borrowed it.
But I love that the kid's now crippled.
So you missed the last truck by two minutes?
Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel, picked up the speed and made up the time.
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and then six minutes and eight minutes late.
Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail.
Yeah, well...
All I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten all those trucks on the plane, those Russkies would be walking on water right now.
Hey, don't...
Don't gimme that look.
It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
Yeah.
It's like a 1992 full-bodied grape juice.
I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
We'd offer you some but, you know, somebody's got to fly the plane.
Yeah, well,
I "just say no," right?
Listen, Stan,
I've been meaning to ask you.
How's Mary?
Oh. Uh, well,
we really don't know anything yet.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday, and, uh, it hasn't meta... metastasized... as far as they can tell right now.
It's just kind of wait and see.
I'm so sorry.
Tell her I'm gonna come by and see her on my next layover.
I want you to know, Stan, we are all thinking about her and you.
<i>- And just blessings.
Thank you, Gwen.</i>
<i>[Answering Machine] Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>
Otherwise, leave a message after the tone. Thanks.
Stan.
Listen.
Uh, I heard about this...
I heard about this doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta.
Uh, he's supposed to be the absolute best.
He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.
Frank Toretta is a systems analyst.
He played center field for us.
You know him.
In the softball tournament last Labor Day.
Anyway, beside the point.
Uh, what I was thinking is, is that I could get his number... the doctor... and, uh, you know, put you all together and...
You know, you could get this thing fixed.
You could beat it.
Thanks, Chuck.
[Sighs]
So, I'll get his number.

Just days before Santa departs on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>
<i>he's been declared physically fit to fly.</i>
<i>Santa got checked out by doctors at the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

How many did you do last night?
Last night? 2.9 million.
Now you've got to be in the market for more of these candied yams.
Here you go.
2.9 has got to be the record.
Look at those marshmallows.
When I was there, we did two million.
We thought that was a big deal.
The glory days.
What'd they do the first night?
The very first night?
<i>- [Man #1] Twelve.
[Man #2] Twelve thousand?</i>
<i>- Hell, no. Twelve.
[Chuck] That's right.</i>
And they did the sort right there on a card table.
And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed.
I've been hearing that for five years.
<i>- It's in his office today.
They go from that to the new hub up in Anchorage.</i>
It's state of the art... a perfect marriage... between technology and systems management.
Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly?
<i>[Excited Chattering]</i>
How long?
Fourteen minutes into the meal.
You won. I owe you $5.
So I win.
Way before the pie.
I told him on the way up.
Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage...
Kelly is still recovering from her failed relationship with that parolee.
He was a lawyer.
I knew it had something to do with raising your right hand... and swearing to tell the truth.
<i>Remember when he fell on the sidewalk and broke his shoulder at the wedding reception?</i>
He tripped on a curb holding a door open for me.
<i>- Aunt Kelly was married before?
[Kelly]
It's not even worth remembering.</i>
So since her failed marriage to the parolee...
Oh, my God.
Kelly can't see being with a man who wears a pager to bed.
What're you gonna attach it to, Hoss?
<i>When you wear it to bed, I hope you got one of those things...</i> that go vibratin'.
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.
<i>Oh, did you hit an olive pit?</i>
<i>- I thought I took all of them out.
No, no, it's not that.</i>
<i>[Guests Chattering]</i>
Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
No, don't.
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well,
then I am.
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here
New Year's Eve.
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.
When are you defending your dissertation?
January 12.
[Sighs] I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing.
If I do that on the third or fourth,
I'm gonna have to head back out on the 13th.
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.
What?
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.
We have to do it in the car.

<i>- test fishing line or something?
Here's your fancy thing.</i>
Thanks.
<i>I love the wrapping.</i>
And I love the box.
Good.
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh, that is terrific.
My grandaddy used it on the Southern Pacific.
Hey, I took this. This is my favorite picture of you.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm always gonna keep this... on Memphis time.
Kelly time.
Hmm.
You haven't said anything about your presents. Is there a problem?
I'm sorry, no!
I love 'em.
Look at my journal.
Ah!
What about the pager?
Real leather.
The pages have gold on 'em.
<i>- Did you like the pager or not?
Yes.</i>
I love it. Look at him in his little blue Russian house.
<i>- It's from Russia.
My God.</i>
<i>- It's not one of those loud ones?
No. You can program it so it vibrates...</i> and lights up and see it in the dark.
It seems like a real nice pager.
<i>- Sorry about the hand towels.
You're hard to shop for.
No, no. I love 'em.</i>
<i>- Every time I wash my hands,
I will think of you.
All right, I gotta go.</i>
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
I love you.
I love you too.
<i>Chuck! Keys!</i>
Thank you.
That reminds me. I almost forgot.
I have one more present for you.
Only this isn't an "open in the car" kind of present... like, say, hand towels.
Which were a joke, by the way.
I'm terrified.
Just take it and hold onto it, and you can open it...

Four hundred miles squared.
That's 160,000... times pi... 3.14.

This could work.
Twenty-two...
Forty-four lashings.
Forty-four lashings.
So...
We have to make rope again.
Wilson, we're gonna have to make a hell of a lot of rope.
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.
That'll be 100... 160.
<i>Here we are today.</i>
That gives us another month and a half until we're into March and April, which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes.
We need...
We need 424 feet... of good rope, plus another 50 feet, say, for miscellaneous.
Round that off to
475 feet of good rope.
Now, if we average
15 feet a day...
Plus, we have to build it, we have to stock it, we have to launch it.
That's gonna be tight.
That is not much time.
But we...
We live and we die by time, don't we?
Now, let's not commit the sin of turning our back on time.
[Laughs]
I know.
I know.
This is it.
That's all that's left.
I checked over the whole island, and that is all that's left.
So we're gonna be short.
Short.
We'll just have to make some more out of the videotape.
Yes.
No, we have time.
We do. We have time.
Look!
The wind's still blowing in from the west.
I know!
Yeah, I know... I know where there's 30 feet of extra rope!
But... But I'm not going back up there.
There, there.
There, you see? Huh?
There.
Are you happy?
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?
Huh? You were right.
You were right.
It was a good thing that we did a test,
'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap.
I would have landed on the rocks.
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
Bled to death.
But it was the only option I had at the time though, okay?
It was what, a year ago?
So let's just forget it.
And what is your point?
Well... we might just make it.
Did that thought ever cross your brain?
Well, regardless, I would rather take my chance out there on the ocean... than to stay here and die on this shithole island, spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball!

<i>She thought you were dead.</i>
<i>And we buried you.</i>
We had a funeral and a coffin and a gravestone.
<i>The whole thing.</i>
You had a coffin?
What was in it?
Well, everybody put something in.
You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures.
<i>I put in some Elvis CDs.</i>
<i>So you had my funeral...</i> and then you had

I have to brief this man on his meetings tomorrow...
I know.
With the accountants and the attorneys, all right?
I will see you bright and early in the morning.
Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
Becca, I need to speak to you.
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fishin', now.
Take care.
Good night.
Good night.
You got everything you need? Okay.
Well, if you need anything, just sign for it, and I'll see you in the morning.
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.
It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man.
<i>- Bring you back to life, man.
[Becca] Bye, Chuck.</i>
Take care, now.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life.
How long are you gonna be, man?
Well...
how long will that buy me?
About ten minutes.
I'm awake.
I saw your taxi drive up.
Get in here out of the rain.
I saw you down at the hub today, so I know you were down there.
Let me get you a towel.
They're sleeping.
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.
It's a nice house.
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too.
What's your daughter's name?
<i>Katie.</i>
Katie.
<i>- She's a beautiful little girl.
She's a handful.</i>
Just let me get one thing straight here.
We have a pro football team now, but they're in Nashville?
[Sighs, Chuckles]
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.
<i>First they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans.</i>
The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans?
Yeah.
But that's not all.
They went to the Super Bowl last year.
<i>- And I missed that.
You would've died. It was so exciting.</i>
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.
<i>I don't have any half-and-half, and that's what you like.</i>
That'll do fine.
What happened to you becoming a professor?
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?
When you, um...
When your plane went down, everything just sort of got put on hold.
I think about taking it up again, though.
I came out here to give you this.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry it doesn't work.
And I, uh,
I kept the picture.
It was all faded anyway.
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.
That's a family heirloom, and it should stay in your family.
<i>That's everything I have from when you went down to now.</i>
They said they never figured out what caused the crash.
Probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire.
So here's where that ship found you.
You drifted about 500 miles.
This is where your island was, about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands.
And these are the search grids.
Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you.
I never should've gotten on that plane.
I never should've gotten out of the car.
I wanna show you something.
Come here.
This is...
This is our car.
You kept our car.
All right, now, this is weird.
It's a good car.
Had a lot of memories in this car.
Two very nice memories.
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.
So, can I drive it?
It's your car.
That's good, 'cause my... my taxi's gone.
Um...
Let me get some stuff out of the back.
You think you're gonna have more kids?
I don't know.
It's kind of confusing right now.
Well, you should.
I mean, really, you should.
I would.
So, what now?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
[Starts Engine]
You said you'd be right back.
I'm so sorry.
Me too.
Chuck!
Chuck!
Chuck!
I always knew you were alive.
I knew it.
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that... that I had to let you go.
I love you.
You're the love of my life.
I love you too, Kelly.
More than you'll ever know.
Chuck?
You have to go home.
We both had done the math, and...
Kelly added it all up.
She knew she had to let me go.
I added it up, knew that I'd...
I'd lost her.
'Cause I was never gonna get off that island.
I was gonna die there, totally alone.
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.
The only choice I had, the only thing
I could control... was when and how... and where that was gonna happen.
So... I made a rope.
And I went up to the summit to hang myself.
But I had to test it, you know?
Of course.
You know me.
And the weight of the log... snapped the limb of the tree.
So l-l...
I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to.
I had power over nothing.
And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket.
I knew... somehow... that I had to stay alive.
Somehow.
I had to keep breathing, even though there was no reason to hope.
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.
So that's what I did.
I stayed alive.
I kept breathing.
And then one day that logic was proven all wrong, because the tide... came in, gave me a sail.
And now, here I am.
I'm back... in Memphis, talking to you.
I have ice in my glass.
And I've lost her all over again.
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.
But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island.
And I know what I have to do now.
I gotta keep breathing.
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.
Who knows what the tide could bring?

[Door Alarm Beeping]
You look lost.
I do?
Where are you headed?
Well, I was just about to figure that out.
Well, that's 83 South.
<i>And this road here will hook you up with l-40 East.</i>
If you turn right, that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff,
California.
And if you head back that direction,
<i>you'll find a whole lotta nothin' all the way to Canada.</i>
I got it.
All right, then.
Good luck, cowboy.
