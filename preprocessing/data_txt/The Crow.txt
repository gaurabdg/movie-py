People once believed that when someone dies... a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead.
But sometimes, something so bad happens... that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest.
Then sometimes, just sometimes... the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.
Over here.
There's a piece of glass.
Hey, Sarge!
Yeah?
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.
Who the fuck gets married on Halloween anyhow?
Nobody.
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.
All right, guys, let's do it.
Devil's fucking Night.
What's the count so far?
143 fires.
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!
You guys can't come in here and take her away like this.
There are procedures. You should have cleared this with me first.
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.
- We found her, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht.
I can see why they took away your gold shield.
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.
All right, clear out.
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.
Tell him to take care of Sarah.
Look, I will.
You just, uh, lie back. Come on.
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, look. Your sister, she's gonna be okay.
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.
She's my friend.
Her and Eric.
You lied to her about Eric.
I had to.
And you're lying to me about Shelly.
She's gonna die, isn't she?
Hey, uh...
Now, come on.
Come on. It's okay.
She's gonna be fine.
A building gets torch ed.
All that is left is ashes.
I used to think that was true about everything... families, friends, feelings.
But now I know that sometimes, if love proves real... two people who are meant to be together, nothing can keep them apart.
Later.
What are you, like the night watchman?
You know, what this place needs is a... good natural catastrophe.
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.
Mickey, come on, man. You got to put the mustard underneath first.
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.
Hey, hey, let me do it.
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?
Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me.
- Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.
Hey, all right.
Now we're talking.
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.
- How do you steer that on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.
Now, Sarah, she's a genuine hot dogger.
You hungry?
- You buying?
- I'm buying.
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?
They make you fart big time.
You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once... from all the crap floating around in it.
I wish I could have seen that.
Fire it up! Yeah!
- All right, we busted their machines!
- Shit!
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T- bird, cop car, cop car.
Bad people out on the street tonight.
- Damn it!
- What was that?
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.
Mickey, call it in for me!
Gabriel!
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!
Code violations?
Safety hazards?
Place looks fine to me.
Let's redecorate.
"Abash, the devil stood... and felt how awful goodness is.
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely. "
It's pornography.
Virtue?
Shelly?
- No! Eric!
- See ya!
No, no, no, me first.
Please.
- Shelly.
- Eric!
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?
Look at that.
Look at that.
Here's to Devil's Night, my new favorite holiday.
You go over there and talk to your pals...
You sick fuck.
Are you out of your motherfucking mind, man?
Look at that!
Pussies drink last, man.
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.
Shit ain't even loaded, man.
This one is.
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers... wants to bet me this one isn't?
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!
- Fire it up! - Fire it up! - Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Here's your shooters.
- Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doing?
Pussycat.
Boo.
- I love you.
- Say that again.
I love you.
Oh, boy.
Restaurant.
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!
Yeah!
- Come here!
- No, no, no!
Couple more rings.
That's 24k.
24k, huh? It's 18k.
It's crap. It's probably fake.
Leather purse. Leather.
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?
A blood stain that's on here?
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.
Now, you, take it or leave it.
Right there for ya.
Decisions, decisions.
You cheap ass, chrome dome...
... child molesting, saprophyte motherfucker.
Close the gate when you go out!
Oh, I close this up for you real good, massa.
Fuck you.
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.
Lucky I didn't stab your fat ass.
What the fuck you all painted up for, crackhead, huh?
Halloween ain't till manana.
Come on.
Fuck, you murderer!
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.
A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.
- You're out of your fucking mind...
- Listen!
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them... on Halloween.
Yeah, yeah, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.
Her name was Shelly.
You cut her.
You raped her.
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked her pink ass and she loved it!
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you about murder. It's fun!
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.
We never miss.
Try harder.
- Try again!
- Aaah!
Victims.
Aren't we all?
- Look at this mess! What's the world coming to?
- It's a mess.
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.
Get out of my way, you worms!
Give me some of that over there!
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.
Hey, guess what?
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.
You're thinking about the past.
Dad gave me this.
Fifth birthday.
He said childhood's over the moment you know you're gonna die.
Is she asleep?
I think we broke her.
I love her eyes.
Pretty.
Hey, kid, get the hell outta the road!
I told you to stay out of here.
So I guess you're not gonna be home till a lot later, huh, Darla?
She's busy. Go play with your dolls or something, okay?
I don't have any dolls.
Get some food, huh?
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.
- "Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police. "
Thirty, forty dollars.
Who the fuck is this now?
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!
Cerrado!
Sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead, unless you want to get mutilated.
Goddamn creatures of the night, they never learn.
Hey! Hey!
"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as if someone... gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "
What are you talking about?
You heard me rapping, right?
You're trespassing, and you owe me a fucking new door!
I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.
Gold.
You're looking for a coroner, shit-for-brains.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!
Shit on me.
Shit on me!
- Aaah!
- Mr. Gideon.
You're not paying attention.
No!
I repeat, a gold engagement ring, yes?
It was pawned here a year ago by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.
He confided in me before he ran out of breath.
Who's this sack of shit?
That's Tin Tin, one of
T- bird's little helpers.
I think you can rule out accidental death.
Don't any of your street demons have real grown-up names?
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't look like your usual gang crap.
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.
I'm suppose to thank you for that, right?
Word to the wise:
Watch your fucking mouth.
What the hell do you call that?
I call it blood, detective.
I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.
You can leave my crime scene now, okay?
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?
- Don't you know this game?
- What game?
Okay, the rings!
I'll tell you about the rings!
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!
Take the fucking rings!
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!
- Look, it goes to the attic.
- Okay.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.
Shelly.
I love you.
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.
- Thank you.
- Take anything!
Now you're going to tell me where to find... the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.
The Pit. They all hang out at The Pit.
T- birds's little potato-heads hang out there. Funboy lives there upstairs.
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.
- A whole jolly club...
- Please!
- with jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Please!
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!
Each one of these is a life... a life you helped destroy.
I'm begging you.
Don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Your job will be to tell the rest of them that death is coming for them... tonight.
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.
You walk outta here, they're gonna erase your sorry ass.
You're nothing but street grease, you motherfucker!
Is that gasoline I smell?
No, man, no!
No!
No!
No!
It's on the house, kiddo, you know that.
One root beer.
I can't do anything.
Your mom... technically, she's off right now.
Yeah, way off.
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"
I thought the police always said, "Freeze!"
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.
And I say I'm dead and I move.
Not one more step.
I'm serious.
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?
You high?
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.
I want you to move over to the curb, nice and easy. Move it!
Okay, we're gonna wait here for backup.
- It's getting too weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.
Do you know someone named T-bird?
He had a friend who shouldn't have played with knives. Like the coat?
You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.
- Check it out.
- He was already dead.
- He died a year ago.
The moment he touched her.
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.
Get away from there!
Cops!
Get outta here!
Leave it, run!
Oh, great, great.
Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell... and you lose him right out in the open.
Well, at least he didn't do that walking against the wind shit. I hate that.
Little early for Devil's Night.
You are very restless.
Just wish I was a little hungry again, that's all.
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, I may get it, I know.
There are energies aligning against you.
Seeing is believing, isn't it?
Mmm, yummy.
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down to the foundation.
Nobody cleared this little event with me.
I didn't have nothing to do with that.
You must be awfully disappointed.
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.
- Yeah, who might that be?
- Tin Tin.
Somebody stuck his blades in all his major organs in alphabetical order.
Gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have... an introspective moment of silence for poor, old Tin Tin.
You're working for me tomorrow night, right?
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good.
That's very reassuring.
I still ain't heard why Gideon's burned down.
Is that a natural catastrophe or act of God or something?
Call it my need to know.
Let go, you creep!
Nah.
You didn't even slow down, you dickhead!
He couldn't have stopped.
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.
What are you supposed to be, a clown or something?
Sometimes.
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.
Annie... look at that.
"We, the undersigned tenants of
1929 Caulderon Court Apartments... "
What is this, a petition?
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice girl who found herself a cause.
- The cause got her killed.
- She was fighting tenant eviction in that neighborhood?
Shelly Webster and her nice rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.
The last time you snooped around a case is when you got put back on the beat.
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.
You're going to wind up working a school crosswalk.
I'm cool.
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.
Ah, I owe you one!
Yeah, right.
Damn.
Tomorrow night we can get high... and watch this whole fucking city burn from that window.
- There's a big fucking bird over there.
- * No more **
Huh?
It's a squab.
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird.
Hey, bird.
Bird. B-B-Birdie.
Here, birdie, birdie.
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie.
Birdie? Hey, birdie?
Here, Funboy.
What the fuck?
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!
Look at him.
Don't sweat it.
It's time for you to take your bird and leave, freako.
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?
You need professional help.
Bingo!
He shoots! He scores!
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.
Ow.
He hands the innkeeper three nails and he asks...
Don't you ever fucking die?
"Can you put me up for the night?"
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Does it... Fuck, does it hurt?
Oh, God.
Look what you've done to my sheets.
I've got a gun in my pocket.
You're happy to see me, aren't you?
Stay away!
Stay away from me!
Look.
Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children.
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.
Your daughter is out there on the streets waiting for you.
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!
Now fill it up!
Fill it up yourself, macho man.
I really need this.
All right.
You burn yourself playing with matches?
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?
Get my friend here a glass of blood.
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!
Hey, good night, Darla.
You stay put right there.
Get away, steamhead.
Shh.
As you can see, I'm on the corner of 27th and Washington...
- the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.
It was exactly one year ago that the building you see... across the street from me was totally demolished by fire.
The fire that was fought by seven fire companies... but lost the lives of two fire fighters.
In fact, if it weren't for the constant surveillance by the local police...
Freeze!
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.
Fuck.
Good likeness.
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.
You still have your hat on.
I gotta sit down.
Shi...
Holy Shit.
Say... are you some kind of... ghost?
Boo!
I don't know what I am. I need you to tell me what happened to us.
You took a six-story swan dive out of a window.
She, ah, was beaten and raped.
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.
Come on. Read the file.
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours in intensive care.
Her body finally just gave it up.
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!
Hey.
You okay?
I saw her.
I saw her through your eyes.
You stayed with her the whole time.
Yeah, well, you got to understand something, all right?
I was hoping she'd come out of it, you know.
Give me something
I could work with.
Yeah.
Look, I...
Why didn't you do something about it?
You think any people in that building, even the ones who signed the petition... would talk after what happened to you?
I kept asking questions and... finally got busted for sticking my nose where it wasn't wanted.
This your wife?
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not anymore, we're getting a divorce.
It's funny.
Little things used to mean so much to Shelly.
I used to think they were kind of trivial.
Believe me, nothing is trivial.
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.
You going to vanish into thin air again?
I thought I'd use your front door.
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what happened to you and your girlfriend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!
I watched the bullet hole close by itself.
And then my business gets blown up real good.
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.
He winked at me before he jumped out a fourth-floor window like he had wings.
He winked at ya?
Musicians.
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard... shit about what you're going to do about all this crap!
What do I get? My livelihood got flushed and went swirling.
You ain't lost everything.
Yeah, and maybe you're not such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!
Fair enough. Catch.
Aah! Jesus.
Say hello to the last fellow who wouldn't cooperate with me.
What're you telling me, this thing is real?
All the power in the world resides in the eyes, fella.
Sometimes they're more useful than the people who bear them.
You're directly out of your fucking mind! You know that!
Yeah.
Eyes see. It's one of the most important things I learned from my sister.
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?
My father's daughter.
That's right.
What's the matter, you don't see the resemblance?
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.
With a lot of detail.
What do you say?
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.
He told me to tell T-bird that death was on its way.
Whatever the fuck that means.
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.
Want to relax that thing now?
This bird man, he just happened to let you live, huh?
You sure you ain't making all this up just to save your own ass?
I ain't making all this up.
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.
All right.
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.
Yeah.
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.
Thanks.
Funboy said he saw a black bird too.
A big one.
Then he choked to death on his own blood.
I'll have the janitor come on up.
You again.
You lost or hungry?
Hi.
I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. We're in this together!
One part falls, it all falls!
- You know how long it took us to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.
That piece of ratshit made Tin Tin into a fucking voodoo doll!
Tin Tin was a dick.
Tin Tin.
Sheesh.
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up!
No Funboy.
Probably still... banging away on Darla.
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.
I'm on it.
What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?
I'm your passenger.
Drive.
What's all this happy horseshit?
Hey, T-bird! T-bird!
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.
- This is business, right?
- Faster.
You got that cream stuff?
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.
What in the crap...
Oh, look. Making us popular.
When they flash us like that, they ain't friends.
This is Vehicle 48. We got us a big, old, red hot rod.
Turn.
You got something personal, amigo, we can work it out.
Right? Huh?
Damn! Dead end!
Look out!
Oh, my God!
Get outta the way!
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!
Shit! Shit!
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.
T- bird!
I got you, man!
Shit!
Remember?
Yeah, I remember everything.
But I don't know what...
What? Huh? What?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.
We needed to put some fear into that little lady.
She wasn't going along with our tenant relocation program.
And her idiot boyfriend shows up and turns a simple sweep-and-clear... into a total cluster fuck!
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history!
Why? What do you want?
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!
Did you send us these complaints?
Come here!
"Abashed the devil stood. "
Does it get you sweaty?
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.
You can't be you. We put you through the window. There ain't no coming back.
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.
T- bird...
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!
T- bird.
"Abashed the devil stood... and felt how awful goodness is. "
"And felt how awful goodness is. "
T- bird. T-bird.
This is the 7:00 a. m. edition of Action News.
For over a decade, the night before Halloween... has had a darker and deadlier nickname in the inner city, "Devil's Night"... the name given to what has become an annual plague of arson.
Last year over 200 blazes were reported, and 11 people lost their lives.
Tonight may become the biggest and deadliest Devil's Night ever.
The mayor has fire fighters from all surrounding counties...
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.
- Wait, you loved eggs.
- Yeah, when I was five.
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?
So what did you take to become mother of the year?
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.
You're acting weird. Did you win the lottery or something, Darla?
Oh, forget it. I never was too good at this mommy shit.
Over easy.
I like 'em over easy... Mom.
Hey, Albrecht.
This is the third hit in your hood in 24 hours.
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.
- We're gonna have to I. D. his teeth.
- His name is T-bird.
Arson was his specialty.
Looks like he zigged when he should have zagged.
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'- shit.
Come here.
You're holding out on me.
I got a goddamn vigilante killer knocking off scumbags left and right... and you're covering up for somebody.
Who's the cartoon character in the painted face?
- You're the detective. You tell me.
- Okay.
Gideon's blows all to hell and you're having a chitchat with some weirdo... who winds up in T-bird's car when it zigs instead of zags.
Then you steal one of my case files from homicide... and you're saying this is just a fucking automobile accident?
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.
You gotta write that shit down.
All right, smart-ass.
The captain's got a little love note waiting for you.
- Welcome to the first day of the rest of your suspension.
- Suspension?
- For what?
- Misconduct.
Yeah, give me the lab.
One for sorrow, two for joy...
- Come here.
- ... three for a girl, four for a boy.
Dancing...
Eric?
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.
Gabriel.
I thought you were dead.
You're not dead, are you?
I knew it was you.
Even with the makeup.
I remembered your song.
You said,
"Can't rain all the time. "
That is from your song, right?
Come on, Eric. I know you're here.
I miss you... and Shelly.
Get so lonely all by myself.
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.
Sarah, I do care.
That's him.
That's him!
But he looked different. He was painted up white like some kind of dead whore.
I seen him. T-bird sent me in for some road beers, right?
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.
And he flash fried T-bird to his fucking car!
Aw, T-bird!
Here's to you, buddy.
Maybe we oughta just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?
- Empty.
- Fire it...
Grave?
What grave?
What about my fucking grave?
Three out of four.
He's working his way back to this speed freak right here.
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control.
T- bird, he came in, he says...
... "Waste them both. " And now this ghost gonna kill my ass next!
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.
- This ghost gonna kill...
- Hey.
That ain't no ghost.
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.
We might need him.
Ghost gonna kill my...
He like his plain or with onions?
Fine.
Don't talk to me.
When someone's dead, they can't come back, can they?
That's what I thought.
Are you referring to anyone in particular?
You'll just think
I'm nuts.
Yeah, well, then maybe they'll have to lock us both up.
- You see him too?
- I saw somebody.
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.
Eric didn't come back for me.
He can't be my friend anymore because I'm alive.
You want a friend to walk you home?
Boys.
It seems our friend T-bird won't be joining us this evening... on account of a slight case of death.
You wanna sit down?
Well, well, well.
Devil's Night is upon us again.
I thought we'd throw a little party... start a bunch of fires, make a little profit.
I like the pretty lights.
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong. Best reason to quit.
Only reason to quit.
A man has an idea.
The idea attracts others... like-minded.
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.
What was the idea?
See, that's what's been bothering me, boys.
But I'll tell ya, when I used to think about the idea itself... it'd put a big old smile on my face.
You see, gentlemen... greed is for amateurs.
Disorder, chaos, anarchy... now that's fun!
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?
I started the first fires in this goddamn city.
Before I knew it, every charlatan and shitheel was imitating me.
Do you know what they got now?
Devil's Night greeting cards.
Isn't that precious?
Yeah.
The idea has become the institution, boys.
Time to move along.
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?
No.
No, I want you to set a fire so goddamn big... the gods will notice us again.
That's what I'm saying.
I want all of you boys to be able to look me straight in the eye... one more time and say,
"Are we having fun or what?"
- Hey, you! What's your name?
- Huh?
Skank!
You don't feel that?
- I feel like a little worm on a big fucking hook.
"I feel like a little worm on a big fucking hook. "
Well, boy, your mama must be damn proud of you!
How the hell did that thing get in here?
Gentlemen.
Let me go!
Let me go! I gotta go!
You're him, huh?
The avenger.
The killer of killers.
Nice outfit.
I'm not sure about the face though.
I just want him.
Well, you can't have him.
Well...
I see you have made your decision.
Now let's see you enforce it.
Aw, this is already boring the shit out of me. Kill him!
Ooh, that had to hurt.
Well, that's that.
That guy was crazy.
He's gone.
Get him!
Right here! Here, help me!
He's gonna kill me!
Jesus Christ!
Hey!
You're all going to die.
Get the fuck outta here!
Guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there.
- Skank's dead.
- That's right.
No!
What in the crap...
- Don't move!
- Hold it!
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.
- Stop running immediately.
- Holy shit!
... arms and legs...
Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs...
Come on! Move it!
My advice:
Next time duck.
So many cops, you'd think they were giving away donuts.
Shit!
Oh. I knew you were gonna do that.
Look at that out there.
The whole city oughta be in flames by now.
Sky oughta be red.
So that, I take it, is the late, great Eric Draven.
He has power, but it is power you can take from him.
- I like him already.
- The crow... is his link between the land of the living... and the realm of the dead.
So, kill the crow and destroy the man.
Hmm.
I'm coming home, Shelly.
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery... in the middle of the night, right?
Safest place in the world to be.
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.
It's really late, Sarah.
You didn't say good-bye.
You're just gonna have to forgive me for that.
And you're never coming back.
I gave this to Shelly once.
I think she'd like you to have it.
This way you'll always remember her.
I'll never take it off.
I better go sneak back in the house.
Bye.
Shh! Shh!
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on.
What is that? Some sort of souvenir there from your pal?
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say, hmm?
Her eyes are so innocent.
Eric!
Eric, help! Eric!
Quick impression for ya.
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!
Give me the girl and I'll let you walk out of here.
Well, well.
Why don't you just give me a minute to think about that, huh?
Nah. Fuck it.
Aw, fuck.
Well, well, well. It does seem to me that our little life has undergone... a rather significant change in the past few minutes now. Wouldn't you agree?
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!
Bye-bye, birdie.
Ah, shit.
Well, just came by to pay my respects... and here you are getting all shot up again.
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?
Two more.
I can handle it.
Don't worry.
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.
You stay in front, and when they run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.
I thought, you know, you were invincible.
I was.
I'm not anymore.
Well, I guess you really will need my help, won't you?
Come on.
You take that.
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.
This is all the power you ever had.
Now it is mine.
Pity there's not more time...
... for us.
Help, Eric!
I'm scared!
Let me go!
Let her go!
You can have me.
I won't fight you.
You can have me.
I won't fight you.
All right.
No!
Eric!
- Sarah?
- Look out!
Eric!
You know, my daddy used to say...
"Every man's got a devil... and you can't rest till you find him. "
What happened back there with you and your girlfriend...
I cleared that building.
Hell, nothing in this town happens without my say-so.
So I'm sorry if I spoiled your wedding plans, friend.
But if it's any consolation to you... you have put a smile on my face.
You got a lot of spirit, son.
I am going to miss you.
I have something to give you.
I don't want it anymore.
Thirty hours of pain!
All at once!
All for you.
Yeah.
Go help him.
Are you alive?
God, I need a cigarette.
Everybody else dead?
You helped me.
What you kept in here saved me.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
I've been meaning to come to church anyway.
Oh, yuck.
I'm quitting as of now... if I live.
Stay with him until help comes.
He'll be okay, right?
Eric?
He does that a lot.
Shelly.
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicides.
At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.
- No, I don't believe it.
- This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home.
- I'm okay.
- Okay.
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.
You missed it.
Get him outta here!
Thanks.
If the people we love are stolen from us... the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them.
Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever.
