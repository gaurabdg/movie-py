Before we dock,

<i>Fﬂght. Brett and I, we think we oughta-</i>
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- You see, Mr. Parker and I... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level.
Well, you'll get what you're contracted for like everybody else.
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.

<i>[Loud Rumb/ing ]</i> [ Parker] Do you ever notice how they never come down here?
I mean, this is where the work is, right?
Well, it's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.
No, but- Listen, man.

I think I know why they don't come down here.
It's because of you.

[ Kane] We are obligated under section eight-
I hate to bring this up, but, uh, this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
Right. And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.
And what about the money? If you wanna give me some money, I'll be happy to oblige.
The man's right. Let's go over the bonus situation.
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. <i>Can</i> I <i>say something?</i>
- <i>Let's talk about the bonus more.</i>
There is a clause in the contract which specifically states... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin... must be investigated.
I don't wanna hear it.
We don't know if it's intelligent.
I wanna go home and party.
Parker, will you just listen to the man?
On penalty of total forfeiture of shares. No money.

If they find what they're lookin' for out there, does that mean we get full shares?
Don't worry, Parker. You'll get whatever's coming to you.
Look, I'm not gonna do any more work... till we get this straightened out.

<i>I need a clear definition.</i> An <i>organism.
Open the</i> hatch.
Wait a minute. If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure-
24 hours for decontamination.
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.
Listen to me. If we break quarantine, we could all die.
Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.
No. I can't do that.
<i>And if you were in my position, you'd do the same.</i>

Yes.

It's not coming off without tearing his face off with it.
We'll have to take a look at him inside. Right.
How come they don't freeze him?
<i>[ Parker Shouting] How come you guys don 'z' freeze him ?</i>
All right, you can take your mask off.
- <i>What's</i> it <i>got</i> down <i>his throat?
- I would suggest ifs feeding him oxygen.</i>
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma, then keeps him alive.
<i>Now what the hell is that?</i>
We gotta get it off of him.

I mean, let's not be too hasty.

<i>Now, we 're assuming ifs feeding him oxygen.

Give it to me, quick.

<i>[ Brett]

It stopped.
Don't see anything like that except, uh, molecular acid.
It must be using it for blood.
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
<i>You don't dare kill it.</i>
What about Kane?
- Here's your <i>pen</i> back.
- <i>[Brett] What do we do now?</i>
Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.

<i>[ Ripley]

Ah, yes, it is.
Um-

Did you want something?
Yes. I, uh-
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh- How's Kane?
He's holding.
No changes.
And, uh, our guest?
Well-
Hmm?
Well, as I said,
I'm still... collating, actually, but, uh,
I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells... and replacing them with... polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance... to adverse environmental conditions.
Is that enough for you?
That's plenty.
What does it mean? Please don't do that.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's an interesting combination of elements, making him a tough little son of a bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying a direct order, remember?
Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.
<i>Oh, yes. I forgot.</i>
You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law.
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see.
You just broke it.
Huh?
Look, what would you have done with Kane? Hmm?
You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here.
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine, you risk everybody's life.
Maybe I should've left him outside.
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take.
That's a pretty big risk... for a science officer.
It's, uh, not exactly out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you, you know.

Parker, I don't want any heroics out of you, all right?
<i>Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.</i>
<i>Now, channels are open on all decks.</i>
I want you to communicate, keepintouch at all times, all right?
Let's go.
I thought you fixed 12 module.
[Brett]
We did.
I don't understand it.
[ Parker] The circuits must have burned out.
What do we got here? Damn it! Hold your light over here, would you?
Yeah, that's it.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
If I could just put this- put this in there.
Right.
Oh, damn it.
<i>Check the insulation.</i>
Oh, Shit!
<i>[ Tracking Device Whirring]</i>
Steady. According to this, it's within five meters.
<i>[ Indistinct Whispering]
I Ripley] Open the door.</i>
<i>[ Ripley] Micro changes in air density, my ass.</i>
[Tracking Device Beeping ]
It's within five meters.
<i>[ Parker]
Be careful.</i>
[ Beeping Continues]
<i>[ Ripley] Christ. [ Parker] Don't do that.
Don't creep up on me with that thing.</i>
<i>[ Ripley]
You guys, stick together.</i>
<i>[ Tracker Twittering]</i>
Don't fail me now.
[ Parker] What?
What is it? Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
Where?
[ Brett]
Here, take this.
Get over there and get the net.
Get it? I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right, Parker.
When I say.
All right. Now.
Easy.
[Hissing]
- [All Chattering ]
- Wait! Don't let him go!
What the hell are you doing, man?
It's the cat.
[Laughing]
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.
I'll I'll I'll
Go and get it, man.
All right. You get him.
We'll go on.

<i>Come on.</i>
[ Snarling ]
[Screaming ]
Whatever it was, it was- it was big and-
You're sure it took him into the air shaft?
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.
No question, it's- it's using the air ducts to move around.
Could he want
Brett alive?
What?
Could Brett be alive?
No. I mean,
I don't think so.
Well, this air shaft may work to our advantage.
Here it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock.
All right. There's only one big opening along the way.
We can cover that up, and then we... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space.
This son of a bitch is huge!
- I <i>mean, it' is like a man- ll' is b/jg!</i>
- <i>Kane's son.</i>
<i>Come on, Ash. Science department should be able to help us.</i>
What can we do to drive it?
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional requirements.
- The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
- Okay. What about temperature?
- What happens if we change it?
- Let's try it.
I mean, most animals retreat from fire. Yes?
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig...
<i>three or four incinerator units?</i>
Give me about 2O minutes.
<i>I'll</i> do it.
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.
No.
You and Ash... take the main air lock.
Parker, Lambert, you cover up that maintenance opening, please.
<i>[ Lambert ]
Right.</i>
<i>[ Beepirly]</i>
- [ Dallas] I'm at the first junction.
- Dallas, I'm right here.
- <i>Parker?</i>
- Yeah?
- <i>Lambert'?</i>
We're in position. I'm just trying to get a reading here.
- The air lock is open.
- <i>Okay,</i> R/jo/ey
Ready.
All right. I've got a reading on you now.
[Tracker Beeping ]
<i>Uh, open the hatch to the third junction.</i>
<i>[ Beepirly]</i>
<i>[</i> Beep/ng Continues] [
Dallas ] Okay, I'm through.
Ripley?
Yes.
Close all the hatches behind me.
I'm moving on.
<i>[ Lambert ] Dallas, hold it a minute.
I think I got it.</i>
<i>Yes, I've got it.
[Dal/as ] Where?</i>
[ Lambert] it's somewhere around the third junction.
Okay, moving on.
<i>It is right around there. Now, Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful.</i>
All right.
I've reached... the third junction, and I'm going down.
<i>[ Sensors Beeping]</i>
[ Beeping ]
The hell's the matter with that box?
Dallas, you're gonna have to hold your position for a minute. I-
<i>I've lost the signal.</i>
<i>What? You sure?</i>
<i>Look around. Are you sure ifs no! there .7 I13 go! to be around there somewhere.</i>
[ Dallas] Checked it out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.
[ Lambert] Dallas, are you sure there's no sign of it?
<i>Imean, it is there.
It's gotta be around there.</i>
- Dallas?
- God, what is happening?
All right.
Uh, am I- am I clear, Lambert? I want to get the hell out of here.
[ Beeping ]
[ Lambert] Oh, God. it's moving right towards you.
Um-
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!
<i>Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!</i>
<i>Get out! [ Sobbing ] Move!</i>
<i>The other way!</i>
[ Screeching ]
[Shrill Feedback]
Dallas?
Oh, no.
Take it easy.
[ Parker]
Dallas?
We found this laying there.
No blood.
No Dallas.
Nothing.
<i>How come I don 'z' hear nobody saying nothing ? I'm thinking.</i>
Unless somebody has got a better idea, we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.
What? And end up like the others?
Ohh. No, you're out of your mind.
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here.
We take our chances and just hope that...
<i>somebody picks us up.
Lambert.</i>
<i>The</i> shuttle <i>won't</i> take <i>four. Then wh y don'! we draw straws and-</i>
I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for killing that goddamn thing right now.
<i>[ Ripley ]
Okay.</i>
Well, let's talk about killing it.
[ Parker Grumbling ]
We know it's using the air shafts-
Will you listen to me, Parker?
Shut up!
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
It's using the air shafts.
We don't know that.
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step...
<i>and cutoff e very bulkhead and every vent...</i> until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.
Obviously it means killing it.
But we have to stick together.
<i>How are our weapons ?
The weapons</i> are fine.
This one needs refueling.
I/I//// you gel' it, please?
Ash, go with him. No, no.
I can manage, Ash.
Don't follow me.
Ash?
Any suggestions from you or Mother?
No, we're still coﬂafing.
[Laughs]
You're what?
You're still collating?
I find that hard to believe.
What would you like me to do?
Just what you've been doing, Ash.
Nothing. I've got access to Mother now, and I'll get my own answers, thank you.
All right.

<i>[ Parker] How come the company senz' us a goddamn robot'?</i>
[Ripley ] All I can think of is they must've wanted the alien for their weapons division.
He's been protecting it right along.
Parker, will you plug it in?
<i>[Parker]! don</i> 7 <i>know Why-</i> Because he <i>may know how to</i> kill <i>it.</i>
<i>[ Ripley J
Ash, can you hear me?</i>
Ash?
[ Distorted Voice]
Yes, I can hear you.
- What was your special order?
- You read it. I thought it was clear.
- What was it?
- Bring back life-form.
Priority one. All other priorities rescinded.
The damn company! What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
I repeat: All other priorities are rescinded.
<i>[ Ripley ]
How do we kill it, Ash?</i>
<i>There is go! to be a way of killing it'.
How- How do we do it'?</i>
You can't.
- That's bullshit!
- You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?
A perfect organism.
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity.
A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.
<i>[ Parker] Look, I- I've heard enough of this,</i> and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
<i>[Ash ] Last Word.</i> What?
I can't lie to you aboutyourchances,buL" you have my sympathies.
We're gonna blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.
Blow up the ship.
Good.
Come on.
When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows? Ten minutes.
No bullshit. If we ain't outta here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space.
We're gonna need coolant for the air support system.
You two go down, get all the coolant you can carry.
<i>I'll</i> get the shuttle ready.
<i>I'll</i> give you about- about seven minutes.
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off, and we'll blow this fucker off into space.
Okay. All right.
Come on.
Ready? Take care of yourself.
Seven minutes.
