RATCHED: AIl right.
Thank you.
-All right, I'm ready.
-Okay. One pair of socks.
T-shirt.
Hi.
Goddamn, boy, you're about as big as a mountain.
Look like you might have played some footbaIl.
What's your name?
He-- He can't hear you.
He's de-- Deaf and dumb Indian.
Is that so?
Come on, Bibbit.
McMURPHY:
Can't even make a sound, huh?
How.
[INMATES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
[WHOOPING]
HARDlNG:
Come on, Billy.
Club lead. Jack of clubs.
Ha, ha. Uh-oh.
McMURPHY: What's your name, son?
-Bill-- Billy Bibbit.
Glad to know you, Bill.
McMurphy's mine.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's old CharIie Cheswick's cards.
-Ha-ha.
-That's his ace of spades.
Your turn, BiIl.
Big 1 0.
-Put one of them on it, will you?
-Wait a minute.
Oh, I can win that one.
-I win.
-Oh, you overtrumped?
-Sure.
-Pinochle, huh, Bill?
-You're avoiding spades?
-Mm-hm.
-Oh, okay. You sure you're avoiding spades?
-What's the bid?
-I know how to play the game.
-Five-- Five-fifty.
Oh, uh, you like to Iook at other people's cards, do you?
-Yes.
-Ever seen this one?
-Come on, Martini.
-Martini.
Martini, wiIl you--?
WiIl you play a club?
Whose turn is it now?
Well, let's see, he trumped.
Where you going?
-Aren't you gonna play?
-What's the matter with him?
-Aren't you gonna play, Martini?
HARDlNG: What's--?
-Martini? I wanna play.
-You took a trump. You got-- It's your Iead.
BiIly? Billy, I wanna win some.... l....
Get a grip on yourself, wiIl you?
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Yes?
-Mr. McMurphy's here, doc.
-Good, have him come in.
Thank you.
McMurphy, l'm Dr. Spivey.
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is to meet you.
-Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down, let's taIk.
-Sure.
[CLEARS THROAT]
R.P. McMurphy.
That's a hell of a fish there, doc.
-Isn't that a dandy?
-Yeah. It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?
-No, 32.
-Thirty-two.
I'll tell you, it took every bit of strength I had...
...to hoId it while the guy took the picture.
Every damn bit.
Probably that chain didn't help it any either.
You didn't weigh the chain, did you, doc?
No, I didn't weigh the chain, but damn,
I'm awfuI proud of that picture.
That's the first Chinooker
I ever caught.
-It's a nice one.
-Hmm.
Randall Patrick McMurphy.
Thirty-eight years old.
Mm.
What can you tell me about, uh...
...why you've been sent over here?
Well, ahem, I don't know.
What's it say there?
-Mind if I smoke?
-No, go right ahead.
Well, it, um...
...says several things here.
Said you've been belligerent...
...talked when unauthorized...
...you've been resentful in attitude toward work in general, that you're lazy.
Chewing gum in cIass.
[McMURPHY LAUGHS]
The real reason you've been sent over here...
...is because they wanted you to be evaluated.
-Yeah.
-To determine whether or not...
...you're mentally ill.
-Uh-huh.
-This is the reaI reason.
Why do you think they might think that?
[SIGHS]
Well, as near as I can figure out, it's because I, uh....
Uh, fight and fuck too much.
In the penitentiary?
No, no, no, you mean why--
Wait--
Why did you get sent over here from the work farm?
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Uh....
Well, I really don't know, doc.
It says here that you went around--
-Let me just take a Iook.
-It ain't up to me, you know.
One, two, three, four....
-You've got at least five arrests for assault.
-Yeah.
-What can you tell me about that?
-Five fights, huh?
Rocky Marciano's got 40, and he's a millionaire.
-That's true.
-That is true.
Of course, it's true that you went in for statutory rape.
That's true, is it not, this time?
Absolutely true. But, doc...
...she was 1 5 years old going on 35, doc...
...and, uh, she told me she was 1 8, and she was...
...uh, very wilIing.
You know what l mean?
-Mm. Mm.
-I practicalIy had to take...
...to sewing my pants shut.
But, uh, between you and me, uh...
...she might have been 1 5.
When you get that Iittle red beaver...
...right up there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at aIl.
-And I don't think you do either.
-I hear what you're saying.
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.
Now they're teIling me
I'm crazy over here...
...because I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable.
It don't make a bit of sense to me.
If that's what being crazy is...
...then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, wacko.
But no more, no less. That's it.
Well, to be honest with you,
McMurphy, what it says here...
...is that...
...they think....
They think...
...you've been faking it in order to get out of your work detail.
-What do you think about that?
-Do I look like that kind of guy to you, doc?
Well....
Let's just be frank for a minute,
Randall, if you would.
Tell me...
...do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really?
Not a thing, doc.
I'm a goddamn marveI of modern science.
Well, you're gonna be here for a period for us to evaluate you.
-We're gonna study you.
-Mm-hm.
We'll make our determinations as to what, uh, we're going to do...
...and give you the necessary treatment, uh...
-...as indicated--
-Doc, Iet me just tell you this.
I'm here to cooperate with you
1 00 percent.
A hundred percent.
I'll be just right down the line with you. You watch.
Because I think we ought to get to the bottom of, uh, R.P. McMurphy.

[INMATE COUGHS]
WASHlNGTON:
Mr. Ellsworth...
...you'lI wear yourself out.
Come here.
Okay.
RATCHED:
AIl right, gentIemen, let's begin.
At the close of Friday's meeting...
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.
Mr. Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy...
...because she drew stares from men on the street.
-Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
-Yes. Uh, yes. That's correct.
He also thinks he may have given her reason...
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't abIe to say how.
Mr. Harding has been heard to say to his wife:
"I hate you.
I don't ever want to see you again.
You've betrayed me."
So does anyone care to touch on this further?
[PAPER RUSTLlNG]
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?
Are you sure?
BiIly, how about you?
No-- No-- No, ma'am.
RATCHED: I'd like to write in my book that you began the meeting.
[INMATE COUGHS]
RATCHED:
Just once.
Mr. Martini?
Are you with us?
Yes.
RATCHED:
Would you Iike to begin?
Mr. Cheswick?
-Me?
RATCHED: Yes.
You mean there's not a man here who has an opinion on this matter?
[INMATE CLEARS THROAT]
RATCHED:
AlI right.
Mr. Harding...
...you've stated on more than one occasion...
...that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Oh, yes. Yes, very much--
I suspect her.
I suspect her.
Well, maybe you can tell us why you suspect her.
Well, I can only...
...speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated,
Mr. Harding...
...that perhaps you are...
...impatient with your wife...
...because she doesn't meet your mental requirements?
HARDlNG: Perhaps, but you see, the only thing I can really...
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...
...is the very existence of my life, with or without my wife...
...in terms of the human relationships, the juxtaposition...
...of one person to another, the form, the content.
Harding, why don't you knock off the bulIshit and get to the point?
This is the point.
This is the point, Taber.
It's not bulIshit.
I'm not just taIking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life.
I can't seem to get that through to you.
I'm not just taIking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody.
I'm talking about form.
I'm talking about content.
I'm talking about interreIationships.
I'm talking about God, the devil, helI, heaven.
-Do you understand? Finally?
-Ha!
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.
Oh. Oh.
It makes me feel very pecuIiar, very peculiar...
-...when you throw in that.
-Peculiar?
-Why?
-What does that mean, peculiar, Harding?
-Peculiar? PecuIiar?
-Peculiar?
SEFELT: Ha-ha-ha.
-I'm going to tell you guys something.
You just don't wanna learn anything.
You just don't want to listen to anybody.
He's got intelligence.
You've never heard the word peculiar?
Say, what are you trying to say?
You trying to say I'm queer?
Is that it?
Little Mary Ann?
Little Marjorie Jane? Huh?
That it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Is that your idea of communicating something?
-Well, is it?
CHESWICK: Oh.
They're aIl crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.
-They're all ganging up on you.
-Is that news?
No, they-- They sometimes wanna gang up on me too, but I--
-Cheswick, do me a favor.
CHESWICK: What? Huh?
-Take it easy.
CHESWICK: Take it--?
-And stay off my side.
CHESWICK: But I only wanna--
I only wanna help you.
HARDlNG: l understand.
CHESWICK: Don't you want me to--?
HARDlNG: Please.
CHESWICK: But I only wanna--
-Please.
-But l only wanna help you.
Please!
HARDlNG:
You see...
...the other day you made some allusions, both of you.
-Illusions?
HARDlNG: A sexual-- Yes, aIlusions.
AlIusions. Not illusions. AlIusions...
...to sexuaI probIems
I might be having with my wife.
AlI right, say it's true.
Say I know it to be true, but you don't.
If that's your idea of trying to tell me something--
Harding, I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something.
SEFELT: Peculiar.
-Asshole again.
FREDRlCKSON:
It makes you feel peculiar.
You been talking about your wife ever since I can remember. She's on your mind.
-Blah, blah, blah.
-I'm not talking about my wife.
When are you gonna get that through your head?
When are you gonna wise up and turn her loose?
FREDRlCKSON: Please.
SEFELT: No, just peculiar.
-I'm tired.
-I don't wanna hear it.
-I don't wanna hear it.
BANCINl: I'm tired.
CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.
-I'm tired.
-It's a Iot of baloney.
CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.
BANCINl:
It's a lot of baloney and l'm tired.
CHESWICK: l don't wanna hear it.
WARREN: We know you're tired. We're tired.
BANCINl: I'm tired and it's a Iot of baloney.
WARREN: You're not tired, Bancini.

Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you. Excuse me, miss.
Do you think it might be possible to turn that music down...
...so maybe a couple of the boys could talk?
That music is for everyone,
Mr. McMurphy.
I know, but do you think we might ease it down a little bit...
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout? Huh?
What you probabIy don't realize...
...is that we have a lot of old men on this ward...
...who couIdn't hear the music if we turned it lower.
That music is aIl they have.
Your hand is staining my window.
-Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. RealIy sorry.

-Mr. McMurphy, your medication.
-Huh?
-What's in the horse pill?
-It's just medicine. It's good for you.
Yeah, but l don't like the idea of taking something if I don't know what it is.
-Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.
-I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.
It's just that l don't want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter.
You know what l mean?
[TAPPING ON COUNTER]
RATCHED:
It's alI right, Nurse Pilbow.
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally...
...l'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way.
But l don't think you'd like it,

You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?

-Oh.
-Yeah.
-Ooh.

God Almighty, she's got you guys coming or going.
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?
HARDlNG:
No, I thought you were the champ.
Wanna bet?
Bet on what?
One week.
I bet in one week I can put a bug so far up her ass...
...she don't know whether to shit or wind her watch.
What do you say to that? Wanna bet?
No, you wanna bet?
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?
You wanna bet? Bet a buck.
One buck. Huh?
I'll bet.
McMURPHY:
Tabes in, 1 buck. Solid.
Last time we were discussing...
...Mr. Harding and the problem with his wife...
...and I think we were making a lot of progress.
So who would like to begin today?
Mr. McMurphy?
Yeah, l've been thinking about what you said about, uh...
[McMURPHY CLEARS THROAT]
...you know, getting things off your chest.
And, uh.... Uh, ahem.
Well, there's a couple of things that I'd like to get off my chest.
Well, that's very good,
Mr. McMurphy. Go ahead.
McMURPHY:
Okay.
Today, as you may or may not know--
It doesn't matter.
--is the opening of the World Series.
What l'd like to suggest is that we change the work detaiI tonight...
...so that we can watch the ball game.
RATCHED:
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...
...is that we change a very carefuIly worked-out schedule.
A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.
Some men on the ward take a long, long time to get used to the schedule.
Change it now, and they might find it very disturbing.
Ah, fuck the schedule. They can go back to the schedule after the Series.
I'm talking about the WorId Series,
Nurse Ratched. Huh?
Well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this.
How would it be if we had a vote...
...and let majority ruIe?
Great. Let's vote on her.
So aIl those in favor, raise your hands.
Okay, guys, come on.
Put your hands up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you wanna watch the World Series?
Come on, get your hands up.
It'll do you good...
...to get some exercise putting your arms up in the air.
That's it. Come on, let's....
What is this crap?
I mean, l watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler, they run it there or they have a riot.
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans.
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes...
...and that's not enough to change ward policy.
I'm sorry.
HARDlNG:
My turn. Okay, hot dice.
I wanna get to go.
Because I need cash.
I wanna get to Mediterranean Avenue.
Big 1 0. Perfect.
Two fives. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine....
-What are you doing?
-Hotel.
-You do not have a hoteI there.
-Hotel.
For the third time...

-...to put a hotel on BoardwaIk.

Because I'm going downtown and watch the World Series anyway.
Anybody wanna come with me?
-I do, Mac. l wanna go with you.
McMURPHY: Ches, all right. Anybody else?
-Where?
-Any bar downtown.
Mac-- Mac, you can't--
Can't get-- Can't get out of here.
Anybody wanna bet?
Hmm, chickenshits?
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched his big thing...
...and she'll open the door for him.
[LAUGHlNG]
Yeah, maybe I wiIl...
...and then maybe I'Il just use your thick skuIl and knock a hoIe in the wall.
SefeIt, see?
[LAUGHlNG]
Why, my head wouId squash like an eggplant.
[LAUGHlNG]
Fuck Sefelt's head,

...and watch the baIl game.
And that's the bet. Now, does anybody want any of it? Huh?
You're gonna Iift that thing?
Yeah. That's right.
I'll bet a buck.
Taber, $1 .
I bet a dime.
Mac, you can't--
Can't li-- Lift that thing.
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?
Hmm?
I'll bet $25.
Twenty-five dolIars, Hard-on.
Mac! Mac, no--
Nobody could ever lift that thing.
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.
You know what l mean?
AlI right.
[GRUNTS]
Giving up?
No. Just warming up.
Warming up. Warming up.
This will be the one.
AlI right, baby. Come on.
[McMURPHY MUTTERING]

But l tried, didn't l? Goddamn it.

MAN [ON RADIO]: And on the mound, the left-hander AI Downing.
The two pitchers stiIl warming up right down below us.
The second game of the 1 963 World Series...

[MAN SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY ON RADlO]
RATChED: Did you teIl the girl how you feIt about her?
Well-- Well, I went--
I went over to her house...
...one Sunday afternoon...
...and I brought--
Brought her some fIowers.
And I said-- I said:
"Celia, will you ma--?"
[STUTTERING]
"Ma--? Marry me?"
[LAUGHlNG]
BiIly?
Why did you want to marry her?
Well, I was in lo--
In love with her.
Your mother told me that you never told her about it.
BiIly, why didn't you tell her about it?
BiIly, wasn't that the first time you tried to commit suicide?
Oh, my God.
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
Miss Ratched...
...l'd like to ask you a question, please.
Go ahead.
Okay, uh....
You know, if, uh...
...Billy doesn't feeI like, uh, talking...
...l mean, uh, why are you pressing him?
Why can't we go on to some new business?
Huh?
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...
...is therapy.
Oh.
Well, you know,
I don't understand this, Miss Ratched...
...because, uh, I don't, uh....
Mr. McMurphy...
...he said something yesterday about a WorId Series.
A basebaIl game?
You know, and l've never been to a baseball game...
...and, well,
I think I'd like to see one...
...and that would be good therapy, too, wouIdn't it, Miss Ratched?
I thought we'd decided that issue.
Well, I don't think so, because, I mean...
...we discussed that yesterday...
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?
That's right, Ches, and we want a new vote on it, don't we?
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?
Yeah.
It'll satisfy me.
There's a vote before the group.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule, pIease raise your hand.
Okay, l wanna see the hands.
Come on.
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?
-All right. That's it.
-I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.
Ha-ha-ha. She only counts nine.
Only nine. It's a Iandslide.
[LAUGHlNG]
There are 1 8 patients on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...
...and you have to have a majority to change ward policy.
So you gentIemen can put your hands down now.
Are you trying to tell me that you're gonna count these?
These poor son of a bitches?
They don't know what we're talking about.
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.
These men are members of the ward, just as you are.
AlI right. All l need is one vote, right?
Right?
AlI right.
Okay.
Wanna watch the World Series?
Come on in, pal.
This could be a big moment for you.
Wanna watch a baseball game?

The Chief has got his hand up, right there.
The Chief voted. Now, will you please turn the teIevision set on?
RATCHED:
Mr. McMurphy...
...the meeting was adjourned, and the vote was cIosed.
But the vote was 1 0-to-8.
The Chief, he's got his hand up. Look.
No, Mr. McMurphy.
When the meeting was adjourned, the vote was 9-to-9.
Ah, come on, you're not gonna say that now. You're not gonna say that now.
You're gonna pull that shit now, when--
The Chiefjust voted. lt was 1 0-to-9.
I want that teIevision set turned on!

[ORDERLY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
MILLER:
Mr. Cheswick.
Come on. Come on.
CHESWICK: l wanna watch television.
MILLER: No, you have a work assignment.
[CHATTERlNG]
-Koufax.
INMATE: Where's my sponge?
McMURPHY: Koufax kicks. He delivers.
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.
Richardson's rounding first, going for second. The balI's in to deep right center.
Davidson over in the corner.
Here comes the throw.
Richardson around the dirt.
Slides, he's in there! A double!
He's in there, Martini!
Richardson, he's on second base.
Koufax is in big fucking trouble.
Big trouble, baby.
AlI right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter.
Tresh looks in. Koufax....
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro.
He kicks once, he pumps.
It's a strike. Koufax's curve baIl is snapping off like a fucking firecracker.
Here he comes with the next pitch.
Tresh swings.
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!
[YELLING]
-It's going! It's gone!
RATCHED: Mr. Washington...
...and Mr. Warren, please see that the men are doing their work.
[CHATTERlNG]
Somebody get me a fucking wiener before I die.
Koufax looks down. Looking at the great
Mickey Mantle now. Here comes the pitch.
MantIe swings.
It's a fucking home run!
Gentlemen, stop this.
Stop this immediately.
[YELLING]
Do you Iike it here?
Well, that fucking nurse, man.
What do you mean, sir?
She, uh....
She ain't honest.
Oh, now, look.
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses we've got in this institution.
[McMURPHY LAUGHS]
Well, I don't wanna break up the meeting or nothing...
...but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, doc?
How do you mean that?
She Iikes a rigged game.
You know what l mean?
Well, you know, I've, uh, been observing you here now...
...for the Iast four weeks...
...and I don't see any evidence of mentaI ilIness at aIl.
I think that you've been trying to put us on alI this time.
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.
[TAPPING]
You know what l mean? Is that it?
Is that crazy enough for you?
Want me to take a shit on the fIoor?
Hmm. Christ.
Have you ever heard the oId saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?
Yeah.
Does that mean something to you?
Uh....
It's the same as "Don't wash your dirty underwear in public."
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?
[McMURPHY LAUGHS]
Well, that sort of has always meant is, uh...
...it's hard for something to grow on something that's moving.
How did you feel about what happened yesterday?
Well, you wanna kill.
You know what l mean?
[LAUGHlNG]
[McMURPHY CLEARS THROAT]
Do you gentlemen have any more questions?
MAN:
No, not at the moment.
I don't have any more, but, uh, perhaps you do.
Do you have a question, McMurphy?
Where do you suppose she Iives?
[INMATES PLAYING MUSIC]
Chief, come on with me.
Come on.
We'll show these guys who's nuts.
Huh?
AlI right, wait. Stand right here.

[McMURPHY LAUGHING]
Hello.

Get onboard. Give them these, Candy.
MAN: Hey, wait a minute.
What the heck is going on here?
-What are you doing on this boat?
-We're going fishing.
No, you're not going fishing.
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.
Oh, yeah, on this boat.
Uh, ask Captain Block.
-Captain Block?
-Captain Block. Yes, that's right.
Who are you?
Uh, we're from the, uh, state mental institution.
Uh....
This is Dr. Cheswick, Dr. Taber,
Dr. Fredrickson...

The famous Dr. Scanlon.
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...
...Dr. Martini, and, uh, Dr. Sefelt.
-How about you? Who are you?
-Oh. I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.
Wait, wait, wait one second.
You don't understand.
We chartered the boat, we're going to go fishing...
...and, uh, that's aIl there is to it.
You better quit on this. They'll throw you in the can again, you know.
No, they won't. We're nuts.
[LAUGHS]
They'll just take us back to the feeb farm, see?
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.
-Tabes, you're at the bow.
SEFELT: This one?
That one. The one at your feet.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Get back on. Jesus.
[McMURPHY LAUGHS]
Tabes.
Cheswick.
Come here, quick.
Aye, aye, sir. l mean, yes, Mac.
Take it easy, Charlie.
You ever driven one of these things?
-Driven one of--?
-Yeah.
-No, Mac. I-- I--
-Well, it's a lot of fun.
-Lot of fun.
-Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.
-Put your hands on.
CHESWICK: l never did this.
Put your hands on the wheel so you don't falI down. All right.
Just hold it steady right there, like that.
-Steady?
-Steady, yeah.
Now just go straight.
-Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
-Straight, Mac?
-Just straight. That's right.
-But, Mac....
Mac, this thing ain't too steady, Mac. Mac!
-Mac. Where are we going, Mac?
McMURPHY: Straight. Just go on.
Oh.
This is the bait.
-Little fishes.
MARTlNI: Dead fishes.
That's right.
Now, what are we gonna do with these little fishes?
-Catch big fishes.
-That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.
And hooks.
Hooks.
Now, hold on to your hooks because here are the fishes.
Tabes.
Get a fish here.
There, for you, Martini.
AlI right, now we each one of us has got a fish.
What are you laughing at, Martini?
You're not an idiot, huh?
You're not a goddamn loony now, boy, you're a fisherman. Ha-ha-ha.
-Yes. Yes.
-Huh? Now, take your bottom hook.
-You got it?
MARTlNI: Yes.
You take it...
...and you push it all the way through. Like that.
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes. Here.
-Right through here.
MARTlNI: In his eye?
McMURPHY: Don't worry about it.
He's dead, Martini.
Jesus Christ, just put it through his eyebalI here.
That's it.
Crunch it right through.
AlI right. Now you got it, see?
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a littIe Ioop.
-That's very good.
MARTlNI: Aah!
McMURPHY:
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson.
Very good eye work. Good eye work.
That littIe devil's gonna not even feel the sting, is he, boy? Huh?
That son of a gun is gonna bite on you, is he? Let me see that face.
You-- You, um--
Got-- Got-- Got beautiful hair.
Thank you.
McMURPHY:
You gotta pull it tight like this.
And you-- You, um, got--
[STUTTERING]
Beautiful eyes.
Thank you. Heh-heh.
BiIly, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?
[STUTTERING]
Yeah-- Yeah--
They-- They-- They do.
McMURPHY:
Now, come on with me, over here.
I'm gonna give each and every one of youse a rod.
[LAUGHlNG]
AlI right. Here are your poles.
[HUMMING]
[SINGING "I'M POPEYE THE SAILOR MAN"]
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.
Understand?
Come on, Candy.
Just keep fishing, guys.
Don't call me unless you get something really big...
...you can't handIe yourseIves.
Keep on fishing.
That's right.
McMURPHY LAUGHING]
Mac?
Hey! Where is everybody?
Hey. Hey!
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to steer that boat straight.
I tried to.
TABER:
Fish!
Fish! Help, help!
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it.
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there and drive!
-Fish!
-I got it, Tabes.
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you.
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up, Tabes!
I got it.
I got it. Give it to me.
-Hey, Harding, l'm the skipper of this boat.
HARDlNG: Ah, shut up.
Well, he said to go straight out as an arrow.
You're not going straight, you're kind of....
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it.
-It's my duty.
-Chessy, stop it.
-No!
-Don't you--
CHESWICK:
No, you son of a bitch.
AlI right, Martini.
AlI right, take him over.
Take him over.
That's it. Now play them, boys.
[LAUGHlNG]
You son of a bitches.
CHESWICK:
Keep it straight.
Come back this way.
McMURPHY:
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut.
Beach bowling, you know what I mean?
[LAUGHlNG]
SEFELT:
We caught it, look.
McMURPHY:
They're gonna be trolling this pIace...
...for six months looking for dead bodies.
Whoo!
We caught it. Look.
I think he's dangerous.
He's not crazy, but he's dangerous.
-You don't think he's crazy?
-No, he's not crazy.
Dr. Songee?
I don't think he's overly psychotic...
...but l still think he's quite sick.
-Do you think he's dangerous?
-Absolutely so.
Well, John, what do you wanna do with him?
Well, I think we've had our turn.
I'd like to send him back to the, uh, work farm, frankly.
MAN: ls there anybody that you have on your staff...
...that could relate to him?
Maybe understand him?
Help him out with some of these problems?
Well, the funny thing is that the person that he's the closest to...
...is the one he dislikes the most. Heh.
MAN: Well, sure.
-That's you, Mildred.
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion, if we send him back to PendIeton...
...or we send him up to Disturbed...
...it's just one more way of passing on our probIem to somebody else.
You know we don't like to do that.
So l'd like to keep him on the ward.
I think we can help him.
AlI right, huh? Chief. Chief, come on.
Come with me, huh? AIl right.
Now, Chief, this is the spot.
Right there is the spot. Remember?
Raise the hands, in the basket.
That's it. Raise the hands up.
AlI right. Let's have a little ball from you nuts in here. Here we go.
AlI right. Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves.
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.
You got six men on the court.
AlI right. Harding, out of the baIl game.
Hey, why me?
-Because I'm the coach. l'll put you in later.
-Oh, no, no. I don't trust you.
[LAUGHlNG]
Ma-- Mac, I'll go.
McMURPHY: Okay, good boy, BilIy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?
AlI right, Iet's play ball.
Harding, break over.
AlI right, Martini, get it back.
I'm in the open. What are you doing?
You threw the damn ball into the fence!
Christ Almighty, you threw the balI into the fence!
There's nobody there.
We're playing ball.
AlI right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here.
-For chrissake.
HARDlNG: Hey, Mac, l'm open. l'm open.
AlI right, Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding. Here.
I'm open.
Harding, will you give me the baIl?
-Stop dribbling the goddamn ball.
HARDlNG: l got it.
McMURPHY:
Harding, over here.
Oh, for chrissake, I'm standing--
HARDlNG: You were covered.
-I was open.
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the--
I was open. Give me the balI.
-You were covered, Mac.
-I wasn't covered. Somebody get back.
-Give it to me. Give it to me.
MAN 1 : All right?
MAN 2: Ow!
MAN 3: Yeah, we're going.
McMURPHY:
Chief. Attababy, put it in.
[CHEERlNG]
McMURPHY:
Get down there.
MAN 4: Defense.
MAN 5: Hey!
[MAN WHISTLES]
Get down there, Chief.
AlI right, aIl right.
HARDlNG: Pick up somebody over there!
McMURPHY: Get this side.
Get around, Chief.
[YELLING]
McMURPHY:
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief.
The balI's in play. Ball's in play.
WASHlNGTON: That's bullshit.
-Ball's in play.
Oh, fuck that shit.
You got to be crazy.
MILLER:
Man, that doesn't go. The ball ain't in play.
MAN 6: Chief.
MAN 7: Go on, Chief.
MAN 8:
Put it in.
Chief, all right! That was great!
[CHEERlNG]
What a ball club.
[CHATTERlNG]
WASHlNGTON:
McMurphy, get off the side.
-Come on, move it, man.
-Hey, damn it.
Go ahead. Come on. Come on.
There's no one looking.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what l mean?
By the time you get out of here...
...you'lI be too old to even get it up.
Sixty-eight days, buddy.
Sixty-eight days.
What the fuck you talking about,
68 days?
That's in jail, sucker.
You still don't know where you're at, do you?
-Yeah, where am I at, Washington?
-With us, baby, you're with us.
And you're gonna stay with us until we let you go.
Do you want to say something to the group, Mr. McMurphy?
Well, ahem, yeah.
I'd like to know why none of the guys never told me that you...
...Miss Ratched...
...and the doctors could keep me here till you're good and ready to turn me loose.
-That's what I'd like to know.
-Well, fine, RandaIl. That's a good start.
Would anyone care to answer Mr. McMurphy?
Answer what?
You heard me, Harding.
You Iet me go on hassIing
Nurse Ratched here...
...knowing how much I had to lose and you never told me nothing.
Now, Mac, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything about how much--
-Shit. Fuck.
HARDlNG: Wait a minute. No, listen.
Now, look. I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, l can go home any time I want.
You can go home any time you want?
-That's it.
-You're bulIshitting me.
He's bullshitting me, right?
No, RandalI, he's telling you the truth.
As a matter of fact, there are very few men here who are committed.
There's Mr. Bromden, Mr. Taber...
...some of the chronics, and you.
-Cheswick?
-Hmm?
You're voluntary?
Mm-hm.
McMURPHY:
Scanlon?
BiIly, for chrissakes, you must be committed, right?
No-- No-- No.
Oh. Oh, man.
You're just a young kid.
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.
What are you doing here, for chrissake?
[INMATES LAUGHlNG]
-What's so funny about that?
BILLY: WeIl....
Jesus, l mean, you guys do nothing but complain about how you can't...
...stand it in this place here, and then you haven't got the guts to walk out?
I mean, what do you think you are, for chrissake? Crazy or something?
Well, you're not. You're not.
You're no crazier than the average asshole walking around on the streets.
And that's it.
Jesus Christ, I can't even believe it.
Those are very challenging observations you made, Randall.
I'm sure some of the men wouId Iike to comment.
Mr. Scanlon?
I wanna know why the dorm is Iocked in the daytime and on weekends.
[SIGHS]
Yeah. l wouId Iike to know about our cigarettes.
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick, and wait your turn.
Go ahead, sit down.
To answer your question about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...
...you know very well...
...that if we left the door open, you'd just go right back to bed after breakfast.
-Am I right?
-So what?
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?
For chrissake.
Cigarettes.
Remember, Mr. Scanlon, we've discussed many times...
...that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic...
...whiIe time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation.
You remember that, don't you?
Do you mean to say...
...it's sick to wanna be off by yourself?
CHESWICK:
Miss Ratched?
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down.
-But l wanna know about--
RATCHED: Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.
I wanna--
-Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
-It's my last one.
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?
HARDlNG:
Look, l'm not running a charity ward, see?
Come on.
Look, l don't want his cigarettes, and l don't want his or his or his...
...or his or his or his or his or his, or even yours.
Do you understand that?.
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched.
I want my cigarettes.
I want mine, Miss Ratched.
What gives you the damn right...
...to keep our cigarettes piled up on your desk...
...and to squeeze out a pack only when you feel like it, huh?
-Miss Ratched.
-Mr.-- Mr. Harding.
[FREDRICKSON LAUGHING]
Oh, I'm sorry.
RATCHED: You surprise me.
-No, welI, I lost my head. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.
I didn't mean--
I'm really very sorry. Just forgot.
-It's all right.
HARDlNG: Thank you.
CHESWICK:
Miss Ratched!
-Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
-I asked you a question.
I heard your question,
Mr. Cheswick...
...and I wilI answer your question as soon as you've calmed down.
Okay.
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?
-I'm caIm.
-Good.
Now, as you all know...
...Mr. McMurphy has been running a small gambling casino in our tub room.
Now, most of you lost all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...
...not to mention a tidy sum of money to Mr. McMurphy.
