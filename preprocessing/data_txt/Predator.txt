- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.
Come on inside.
Eighteen hours ago, we lost a chopper... carrying a cabinet minister and his aide from this charming little country.
We've got a transponder fixed on their position...
<i>...about here.</i>
<i>This cabinet minister does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?</i>
Apparently they strayed off course.
And we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?
<i>Because some damn fool accused you of being the best.</i>
[Chuckles]
Dillon!
You son of a bitch!
What's the matter? The C.I.A. got you pushing too many pencils?
Huh?
Had enough?
Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.
- [Laughs] Okay, okay, okay!
- You never did know when to quit, huh?
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.
- What is this fucking tie business?
Forget about my tie. I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin.
- Very nice, Dutch.
- Good old days.
Like the good old days.
Then how come you passed on Libya, huh?
- That wasn't my style.
- You got no style. You know that.
Come on.
Why did you pass?
We're a rescue team, not assassins.
Now, what do we got to do?
That cabinet minister is very important to our operations in this part of the world.
The general's saying a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed.
<i>We can't let that happen.
We need the best.</i>
- That's why you're here.
- Go on.
A simple setup.
One-day operation.
We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down... grab those hostages and bounce back across the border before anybody knows we were there.
- What do you mean, âweâ?
- I'm going in with you, Dutch.
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.
<i>Once you reach your objective...</i>
<i>Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.</i>
<i>âª [Man Singing on Radio]</i>

Rendezvous points and radio freqs are indicated and fixed.
AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?
- No such thing, old buddy.
<i>This is a one-way ticket. Once we cross that border, we 're on our own.</i>
[Chuckles]
This is getting better by the minute.

Hey, Billy.
Billy!
<i>The other day, I went up to my girlfriend. I said...</i> âYou know, I'd like a little pussy.â
She said, âMe too.
Mine's as big as a house!â
You see, she wanted a littler one, 'cause hers was-
As big as a house.
Get that stinking shit out of my face.
A bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here!
This stuff will make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,just like me.
Yeah. Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.
<i>[Blain Laughing]</i>
<i>That was in '72. North of Hue.
Me and Dutch both got one.</i>
That's a real nasty habit you got there.
- [Beeping]

<i>[Beeping Continues]</i> âª [Stops]
<i>[Man on Radio, Indistinct]</i>

Hawkins, you're up.
<i>[Man On Radio]

<i>[Animals Chittering]</i>
<i>[Chittering Continues]</i>
The pilots have each got one round in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.
- Took him out with a heat-seeker.
- There's something else, Major.
- Hmm?
- This is no ordinary army taxi.
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.
Pick up the trail yet?
Billy's on it.
Heat-seeker, Dillon.
That's pretty sophisticated for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.
Major!
I guess they're getting better equipped every day.
There were 12 guerrillas.
They took the two men from the helicopter, but there's something else.
What do you mean?
Six men wearing
U.S.-issued army boots.
They came in from the north, and then they followed the guerrillas.
Mean anything to you?
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.
- Get ahead and see what you can find.
- Yes, sir.
<i>[Birds Squawking]</i>
What's he got?
Same business. Guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment.
Do you remember Afghanistan?
I'm trying to forget it.
Come on. Let's go.

Jim Hopper.
Mac, cut 'em down.
I knew these men.
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?
I don't know, Dutch.
This is inhuman.
Nobody told me there was an operation in this area.
- They shouldn't have been here.
- But somebody sent them.
<i>The guerrillas skinned them?</i>
<i>Why did they skin them?</i>
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.
<i>- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.</i>
There was a firefight.
They were shooting in all directions.
I can't believe that Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I don't believe he did.
I can't find a single track.
Just doesn't make sense.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
There's no sign, sir.
They never left here.
Hell, it's like they just disappeared.
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.
We move, five-meter spread.
No sound.
It's time to let
Old Painless out the bag.
Payback time.
<i>[Heart Beating]</i>
<i>[Heartbeat Continues]</i>
<i>[Birds Screeching]</i>

He killed one of the hostages.
We move.
Mac, Blain- the nest.
Billy, Poncho- the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon- backup.
As soon as they're set,
I hit the fuel dump.
[Exhales]

Hawkins, call in position and situation.
<i>Get Connor for the hook!</i>
You got it, Major.
[Cocks]
Oh, shit.
<i>- Mac, any sign of the other hostage?
- [Mac] Yo!</i>
Found the other guy.
He's dead too.
And the kid from the chopper.
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was C.l.A.
<i>Another thing, Major.
We were lucky.</i>
<i>Other guys we waxed-
Russian military advisers.</i>
Something pretty big was gonna happen here.
Good work, Mac.
Clear the area. No traces.
- Get the men ready to move.
- All right.
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.
You're hit.
You're bleeding, man.
I ain't got time to bleed.
Oh, okay.
You got time to duck?
This is goddamn beautiful.
Goddamn jackpot.
<i>This is more than we ever thought we'd get.</i>
- [Papers Rustling]
- Man, we got those bastards.
We got 'em.
I think this is what you're looking for.
You set us up!
It's all bullshit, all of it- the cabinet minister, the whole business.
- You got us in here to do your dirty work.
- We stopped a major invasion.
In three days, they'd have been across the border with this stuff!
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.
You're pissed about the cover story.
I knew I couldn't get you in here without it.
So what story did you hand Hopper?
Look, we've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit!
Hopper's orders were to go in and get my men, and he disappeared!
He didn't disappear.
He was skinned alive!
My orders were to get somebody in who could crack these bastards!
So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.
[Scoffs]
What happened to you, Dillon?
You used to be somebody
I could trust.
I woke up.
Why don't you?
You're an asset, an expendable asset... and I used you to get the job done.
Got it?
My men are not expendable.
And I don't do this kind of work.
<i>[Hawkins] Major! Major,
We stepped into some bullshit here!</i>
<i>- [Groans]
- [Dillon Speaking Spanish]</i>
Air surveillance says we got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.
This place is going down.
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- Yes, sir.
She goes with us. She's too valuable.
She's got another whole network.
She'll give away our position any chance she gets. No deal.
You're still under orders.
You want to make that call, or should I?
She's your baggage.
You fall behind, and you're on your own.
<i>[Heart Beating]</i>
[Man Speaking, Warped]
This place is too hot for a pickup.
They won't touch us till we get over the border.
Hey, Billy, give me a way out of this hole.
The aerial says we are cut off.
The only way out of here is that valley that leads to the east.
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.
Not much choice.
Poncho, take lead.
Double-time it.

The other day,
I was going down on my girlfriend... and I said to her, âGeez, you got a big pussy.
Geez, you got a big pussy.â
She said, âWhy did you say that twice?â
I said, "I didn't."
See, it was 'cause-

What's got Billy so spooked?

I- I can't tell.
<i>- What in God's name?

I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
Ask her what happened.

Bullshit.
You're just like the rest of us.
Shitload of good a chopper's gonna do us in here anyhow.
Sergeant? Sergeant! Sergeant!
Who hit us today?
I don't know. I only saw one of them camouï¬aged.
He was there.
- Those eyes disappeared.
- What was that?
Those eyes, they- they disappeared.
<i>I know one thing, Major.
I drew down and fired straight at it.</i>
Capped off 200 rounds in the mini-gun, full pack.
Nothin'. Nothin' on this Earth could've lived... not at that range.
Mac, you take first watch, then you get some rest.
Ask her-
Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.
Go ahead. Ask her.

[Responds In Spanish]
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle came alive and took him.
Billy, you know somethin'.
- What is it?
- I'm scared, Poncho.
<i>Bullshit.
You ain't afraid of no man.</i>
There's something out there waiting for us... and it ain't no man.
We're all gonna die.
The man's losin' it.
He's losin' his cool.
<i>There is nothin' but a couple of guys runnin ' around out there, and we've gotta take 'em down.</i>
You still don't understand,
Dillon, do you?
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper... and now it wants us.
<i>[Animals Hooting]</i>
<i>Here we are again, bro. just you and me.</i>
Same kind of moon.
Same kind of jungle.
Real number 10 night.

Whole platoon, 32 men, chopped into meat, and we walk out, just you and me.
Nobody else. Right on top of 'em.
Not a scratch.
Not a fuckin' scratch.

<i>[Billy] Blain's body.
It's gone.</i>
It came in through the trip wires.
Took it right out from under our noses.
<i>[Birds Screeching]</i>
That boar had to set off a trip flare, Major... because there ain't no other tracks.
How could anyone get through this, carry out Blain without us knowing it?
Why didn't he try and kill one of us?
He came in to get the body.
He's killing us one at a time.
<i>[Billy]
Like a hunter.</i>
He's using the trees.
- Yesterday. What did you see?
- You're wasting your time.
No more games.
I don't know what it was. it-
- Go on.
- It changed colors, like the chameleon.
It uses the jungle.
You saying that Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fuckin' lizard?
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two or three men out there at the most.
Fuckin' lizard!
- What's your name?
- Anna.
Anna, this thing is hunting us, all of us.
You know that.
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
We're gonna need everyone.
I'm takin' her back. We're out of here in five minutes.
You're not going yet.
Look. The rendezvous is 10 to 12 miles away.
- You think the chopper's gonna wait?
- Dillon, we make a stand now... or there will be nobody left to go to the chopper.
There is something else.
When the big man was killed, you must've wounded it.
Its blood was on the leaves.
If it bleeds, we can kill it.
<i>[Grunting]</i>
Look out.
You really think this Boy Scout bullshit's gonna work?
It can see our trip wires.
Maybe it can't see this.
Instead of complaining, maybe you should help.
[Chuckles]
What makes you think he's gonna come in through here?
There are trip wires on every tree for 50 yards. This is the only way in.
When I was little, we found a man.
He looked like- like, butchered.
The old women in the village crossed themselves... and whispered crazy things, said strange things.
[Speaking Spanish]
Only in the hottest years this happens.
And this year, it grows hot.
