I understand, yes.
Thank you so much, Mr. Jeffries.
Thank you. You'll have the money by the end of the day.
Let's go.
Phineas, hurry up.
We're gonna miss the train.
Stand up straight.
Wipe that muck off.
WOMAN: Pinkie up.
Arm extended, elbow out.
Sip, never slurp.
Pinkie in the air, arm extended... elbow out.
Keep your cup level.
Gently lower your cup.
Shall we do it again?
Pinkie in the air... arm extended, elbow out.
Gracefully.
Charity, come here.
Your dress.
Is this how we've taught you to behave?
It's my fault, sir.
I made her laugh.
Well, thank you for your honesty.

How'd you get out?

- CHALMERS: Mr. Smith?
- SMITH: Yes.
- CHALMERS: Have a look at this.
- SMITH: Of course.
SMITH: Yes, yes, I see it.
Thank you, Chalmers, that'll do.
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.
Uh, if I may, sir,
I believe I have skills and ideas that go well beyond punching numbers into an adding machine.
Well, I've read about this German fellow,
Lilienthal, I believe, who's developed a glider that can take a man in the air, sir.
Isn't that amazing?
I mean, if you were to apply that to this business,
- it would be revolutionary.
- Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?
You're all dismissed.
Bankrupt?
I thought the company had a dozen trading ships.
Yes, at the bottom of the South China Sea.
Typhoon sank 'em all.
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!
- Hey.
- Oh, God!
You're home early.
And until further notice.
Well, I didn't think you were long for that job.
Or any job, apparently.
That's what makes our life together so exciting.
Charity.
This isn't the life I promised you.
But I have everything I want.
What about the magic?
What do you call those two girls?
Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral.
Daddy!
- PHINEAS: Come here!
- Did you bring a present?
- A present for what?
- (LAUGHING)
- For my birthday!
- Your what?
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.
Okay, I do have a present... but not just any present. Oh, no.
The most amazing birthday present ever.
This extraordinary machine was originally created by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago.
But the blueprints had been lost for centuries until just last week, on a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket.
They found skeletons and treasures and the blueprints were recovered by none other than J.W. Mercantile.
The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly but I managed to commit them to memory.
And if I have remembered correctly...
Happy birthday, Caroline.
This is a wishing machine.
You tell it your wishes... and it keeps them safe until they come true.
Even if you forget them, they're always there.
Can I tell a wish?
Step right up. Go ahead.
I wish to marry Santa Claus.
(CHUCKLES) That is a good wish.
I wish... for ballet slippers.
Hey, that's... that's a good wish, too.
What's your wish, Mommy?
I wish... for happiness like this forever for you and you... and for your father.
Boring!
- (PHINEAS LAUGHS)

- (MAN LAUGHING)
The goat prices go up, so the pork bellies go down.
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?
This bank only wants to lend money to people with money.
What are you looking at, flop-doodle?
Mr. Barnum.
This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre.
It's a good bet is what it is, sir.
People don't want to admit it... but they're fascinated with the exotic and the macabre.
It's why we stare at it.
The bank is going to need substantial collateral.
Of course. I, uh...
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.
The deed and title to my entire flotilla of trading vessels.
CHARITY:
Why would a bank loan us $10,000?
Because we put up collateral.
But, dear, we don't have any collateral.
Sure we do. In the South China Seas.
CHARITY:
In the South China Seas?
Deep in the South China Seas. (LAUGHS)
CHARITY:
And what did we buy with this loan?
"Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities."
What kind of museum is it?
A place to be transported.
A place where people can see things they've never seen before.
Huh?
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.
They're all the rage in Europe. Look.
Marie Antoinette with the sore throat. Napoleon.
Come here. See?
You've already met some of the most famous folks in history.
But they're not all wax.
This is the great... O'Malley.
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.
You don't look like a magician.
I'm a thief.
A very good thief.
I caught him nicking my watch.
- (SPITS)
- (COIN CLATTERS)
- See?
- An elephant!
PHINEAS: Not just any elephant.
I can get you somethin' real nice.
Just say the word.
CHARITY: Oh. Thank you.
Oh, yeah. This is a ten-ton bull straight from the plains of Africa.
- And look at that.
- (LAUGHING)
The tallest giraffe in the world.
CAROLINE:
Can I climb up its leg?
- Absolutely not. Okay.
- (GIGGLING)
Now... I know how it looks.
If you didn't, I'd be worried.
I mean, it just needs a little work, but...
The loan has to be paid back every month.
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
It is one hour of your time, sir, but it will change your life.
- We have shows on the hour every hour.
- I love your dress.
Surely not for the faint of heart, but I can tell you're gonna love it.
Half price for anyone who's wearing a hat.
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.
- Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
- (SIGHS)
MAN: Load of garbage.
WOMAN:
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.
Welcome to the Barnum Museum, where everyone's special...
How many tickets?
- Three.
- Three.
CAROLINE: Daddy.
Daddy.
Did you sell any more tickets today?
A few. Yeah.
Most everyone was rushing home, it's Friday, but... we sold a few.
I think you have too many dead things in your museum, Daddy.
Do you?
She's right. You need something alive.
Go to sleep, both of you.
Something sensational.
That's a big word.
It's your word.
Something that isn't stuffed.
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.
CAROLINE: Unicorns aren't real.
HELEN:
Well, mermaids aren't real either.
You must be Gertrude Stratton.
I'm looking for your son.
I don't have a son.
The hospital record says you do.
Charles, right? Age 22?
GERTRUDE: Charles!
Charles!
P.T. Barnum, at your service.
I am putting together a show and I need a star.
You want people to laugh at me.
Well, they're laughing anyway, kid, so might as well get paid.
I see a soldier, no, a general riding across the stage with a sword and a gun, and... and...
And the most beautiful uniform ever made.
People will come from all over the world, and when they see him, they won't laugh.
They'll salute.
How's it looking, girls?
MAN:
Hey! You looking for freaks?
I know where you can find one of them.
Really?
Come on, girls.
Hello.
Sir, you shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry. Who's doing that singing?
It's you, isn't it?
WOMAN:
Sir, I'll have to ask you to leave.
You are so talented, blessed... extraordinary.
Unique.
I would even say beautiful.
Sir.
Please leave me alone.
They don't understand, but they will.
This line is so...
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.
PHINEAS: Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?
- ANNE: Yes, sir.
- PHINEAS: Terrific. And what do you do?
- Trapeze.
- PHINEAS: Trapeze.
- Okay.
- You know, people aren't gonna like it if you put us on the stage.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
- Is this over... your...
- Entire body.
Terrific. I don't need to see it.
- Now. (LAUGHING) Yes!
- (SHOUTS)
Can I just ask how heavy you are?
Do you have a number for that?
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.
500 pounds.
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!
What is your name?
Vasily Palvos, sir.
Yeah, we're gonna change that name.
Uh, I think you're Irish.
We have a show!
That's good, but I need it five times bigger!
And I want it everywhere!
Carriages, sides of trains, trolleys, crates, milk bottles, everywhere they look!

MAN:
One for me, one for the lady.
(CLEARS THROAT) O'Malley.
Ah, Mr. Bennett from the Herald.
Come to take in another show, huh?
Tell me, Mr. Barnum, does it bother you that everything you're selling is fake?
Do these smiles seem fake?
It doesn't matter where they come from.
The joy is real.
So, you are a philanthropist?
Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.
Men suffer more from imagining too little than too much.
The creed of a true fraud.
Mr. Bennett, when was the last time you smiled or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?
A theater critic who can't find joy in the theater.
Now who's a fraud?
Oh, Mr. Bennett.
That word you used to describe my show?
Has a nice ring to it.
- (GIGGLING)
- And right this way.
Don't you think there's enough blind trust in my life?
Well, isn't that what makes it fun?
Keep coming. Okay. Are you ready?
- CHARITY: Is it?
- PHINEAS: It is.
Come on. Let's go.
Push.
- Oh.
- Wow.
Helen, that's for you.
And, Caroline, this is for you.
There's a ballet school right down the street.
Just past your parents' house, actually.
Don't tell me you bought this house just to rub my parents' noses in your success?
Well, that wasn't the only reason.
This is the life I promised you.
Shall we?
Phin... it's beautiful, but you know, we don't need all of this to be...
- (LAUGHS)
- PHINEAS: It only took me 25 years, but... welcome home, Charity Barnum.
- Hello, there.
- MAN: There goes Barnum.
PHINEAS: Hey, sweetheart, who's that young man over there?
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.
A bit of a scandal, they say.
His last play was a hit in London.
- Play?
- Mmm.
You pay good money to watch people stand around and talk for two hours, and they call me a con man.
Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that?
Ew. Something does smell.
Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts.
I can see it right now.
"Youngest prima ballerina in the history of the City Ballet."
I'm quitting.
What? Why would you quit?
I started too late. I'll never catch up.
Caroline, you were the best dancer on that stage.
What? You think I can't spot talent?
Ballet takes years of hard work.
It's not like the circus.
You can't just fake it.
She can't quit. No.
No, I mean, she just...
She just feels out of place with the other girls.
Well, I should certainly hope so.
I've never seen so many little prima Donnas in my life.
Yeah, but those prima Donnas are the most important thing in the world to her right now.
She'll learn to ignore them just like I did.
She shouldn't have to.
New York society will never accept us.
If they did, they'd have to stop judging and actually do something with their lives.
This isn't about me.
Oh.
So it's different than everything else then?
I just want her to be proud of who she is, of her family.
She is proud.
We don't have to be the Carlyles.
Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play?
Yes, I did indeed.
Refunds are available at the front box office.
(CHUCKLES) P.T. Barnum.
From the circus?
Yes. You... you've been?
(CHUCKLES) God, no.
But I have seen the crowds.
People leave your shows a great deal happier than when they came in, which is much more than I can say for my play.
And yet, you have no trouble selling tickets.
That's because I'm selling virtue.
Can I buy you a drink?
I wanna go after the carriage trade.
Present legitimate acts, expand our appeal, go after the snobs.
If you only knew how suffocating they are.
So come join the circus.
You clearly have a flair for show business.
Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows.
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off and join the circus.
Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?
Let's just say that I find it much more comfortable admiring your show from afar.
Comfort, the enemy of progress.
Do you understand that just associating with you could cost me my inheritance?
Oh, it could cost you more than that.
You'd be risking everything.
But, on the other hand, well, you just might find yourself a free man.

W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce my newest hire, Mr. Phillip Carlyle.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.
And what is your act, Mr. Carlyle?
I don't have an act.
Everyone's got an act.
O'MALLEY: Mr. Barnum!
Yeah.
You better come see this.
PHINEAS: Phillip, keep up!
- (INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
- A bit of a nasty element.
There always is, isn't there?
Nothing draws a crowd quite like a crowd.
We don't want you in our city!
Go home, you freaks!
Freaks!
PHINEAS: "Shame of the city."
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation as a purveyor of the offensive and indecent"
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.
HELEN:
No, I'm blushing. (GIGGLING)
WOMAN: What do you care what Bennett thinks?
- LETTIE: He's a prig.
- And a snob.
Yeah, and all the snobs in New York read him.
He does their thinking for them.
Whatever happened to thriving off controversy?
Yeah, well... hey.
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- HELEN: Phillip!
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.
- Helen, come on.
- (HELEN GIGGLES)
"The Master of the Household
"has it in command of the Queen
"to invite Mr. Phineas T. Barnum
"and his theatrical troupe to a reception at Buckingham Palace."
The Queen Victoria? Is this real?
I had to pull a few strings.
If you want society to accept you, you may as well start...
- at the very, very top.
- (GIGGLES)
Are we all invited?
I guess I'll just have to tell the Queen that either all of us go... or none of us will.
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.
PHILLIP: Why aren't we in tails?
PHINEAS:
We're the entertainment.
LETTIE:
Don't see you in a costume.
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum and his...
Oddities from America!
WOMAN: Is that... is that real?
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING,
MURMURING)
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.
And I've heard all about your little colonel from my friends in America.
General, ma'am.
You're even smaller than I imagined.
Well, you're not exactly reaching the top shelf yourself, sweetheart.
That went well.
STEWARD: Your Majesty.
PHINEAS: Phillip.
Miss Jenny Lind.
WOMAN: She is luminous.
Who's that?
PHILLIP: The opera singer?
Singer, huh?
She's the most famous performer in all of Europe.
She's sold out La Scala a dozen times.
Not to mention the French Opera.
Ah.
- What are you doing?
- Following you,
- so you can introduce me to Miss Lind.
- PHILLIP: Introduce you?
- PHINEAS: Yeah.
- PHILLIP: I don't know her.
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.
Yeah, exactly. You don't just march up to someone like this.
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.
Miss Lind.
My name is Phillip Carlyle.
And this extraordinary gentleman next to me...
Phineas Taylor Barnum.
The pleasure's mine.
Of course, you are the American.
I believe I might have heard of you.
Oh, well, if you've heard of me all the way over here,
I must be doing something right.
That, or something very wrong.
Well, in the world of publicity, there's hardly a difference.
I believe those are the words of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.
A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman.
The best on my side of the Atlantic.
Well, if you do say so yourself.
I do, but I don't have to.
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?
No, he is one of the best.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind... let me get to the point.
I'd like to bring you to New York.
And if you agree, I'll make you the most famous singer not in Europe, but in the entire world.
Mmm.
And have you heard me sing?
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.
But like mine, your reputation precedes you, and, well, I trust your reputation more than my own taste, so...
I've never been to America.
You will sing in the grandest theater with the finest orchestra in the greatest city on Earth.
"Jenny Lind.
"One night only."
- (LAUGHS)
- Or maybe two.
And at 20 percent of the gate, it'll be a queen's ransom for your efforts.
I give most of my earnings to charity, Mr. Barnum.
To orphans and widows.
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."
That's brilliant. I mean, the press will go crazy for that story.
That's not a story.
May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum?
Anything-
Why me?
People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked.
Just once, I'd love to give them something real.
MAN: Miss Lind.
Everyone is here. Look at this.
Even the Winthrops.
Are you happy?
I will be if this works.
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.
PHINEAS:
What's taking her so long?
They're still taking their seats.
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?
Torn and Lettie, the others, they've just arrived.
- What?
- (AUDIENCE MURMURING)
Where should I put 'em? Your box?
That box? No, no, no, that's a bit visible.
- Visible?
- The acoustics are actually better in the standing room.
That's where they should be.
Miss Lind's ready now.
Okay. Thank you, thank God!
This is so awesome.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
MAN: He's out of his element.
MAN 2: What is this about?
MAN 3: Is that Barnum?
WOMAN: This isn't the circus.
I recently had the privilege of hearing the most divine voice
I've ever heard.
Suddenly, he's a connoisseur.
PHINEAS: Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug... but I have 100 bottles of good champagne on ice that says this isn't just another sideshow novelty.
May I present... the Swedish Nightingale...

Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.
Of course, and I've heard so much about you!
And your father tells me you're a fan of the ballet.
Yes, I'm studying ballet.
Are you?
- Of course, lam.
- And, of course, she is.
And what about you, Helen?
You look like a princess, ma'am.
I have to admit, Barnum... she is remarkable.
Enough to bring joy to the most joyless critic, isn't she?
Mmm. And in the hands of a real purveyor of the arts,
- she could be something in this country.
- (LAUGHS)
Shame, she's fallen in with you.
You really are better on the page, Mr. Bennett, hard as that is to believe.
WOMAN:
Mr. Barnum, I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- PHINEAS: And you will meet Miss Lind.
- WOMAN: Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...
- Phineas.
Yes.
You've... done well.
Thank you.
Allow me to introduce you.
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.
I'd like you to meet Charity's parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.
Ah, pleasure.
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- MRS. HALLETT: Are these...
Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters.
- Phineas, not here.
- Not here?
You afraid I'm gonna embarrass your parents in front of their fancy friends?
I... I really don't think
I have that power.
An insignificant man like me who was clearly destined to lead an insignificant life.
All that fortune, and still just the tailor's boy.
Get out.
Well, Phineas...
I believe I told you that free champagne is a recipe for disaster.
- Charity.
- Now would everyone please
- raise their glasses?
- PHINEAS: Charity.
To Mr. Barnum, who has shown once and for all that a man's station is limited only by his imagination.
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.
To Mr. Barnum.
Thank you.
It's hard to understand wealth and privilege when you're born into it.
I sometimes don't feel like I belong here.
You?
I was born out of wedlock... and that brought shame upon my family.
And life always manages to remind me that I don't deserve a place in this world.
And that... leaves a hole that no ovation can ever fill.
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...
Lord, that lady can sing!
I know.
Think she likes a man in uniform?
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?
You got a show in an hour, okay?
That's enough time for us to have at least three drinks, right?
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?
- It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling... guys!
Who's gonna pay admission if you're out there for all the world to see?
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.
- (GLASS CHIMES)
- PHINEAS: Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!
Jenny, America may not know it yet... but they are going to love you.

PHILLIP: Why can't you just put more shows in New York?
Why do you need to tour the country?
Why did Napoleon march on Russia?
Napoleon was defeated.
Napoleon didn't have a 60-piece orchestra.
A 60-piece orchestra?
Just get the cheapest musicians you can and watch that.
We'll still have to board them.
We'll get married ones, they can share a bunk.
O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank.
- PHILLIP: Custom sets?
- PHINEAS: Yeah.
- PHILLIP: Fireworks?
- PHINEAS: Uh-huh.
Inside theaters?
That's genius.
No. Hey, P.T.
These are the most famous theaters in the country.
They make you buy the seats in advance just to book them.
Yeah. I took out a loan.
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?
You're not gonna see a penny of profit until your 40th show...
41st, actually.
You're risking everything you've built here.
How do you think I built it?
We'll have plenty of profits to go around after this.
- P.T.?
- What?
Your attention has been divided long enough.
Our gate is down, we have more protesters every day.
You just need to get people to come back.
"If you haven't been to the Barnum Museum lately, you haven't been at the Barnum Museum."
They come to see you.
Your crazy ideas... your new acts, the unusual.
Well, then how about you show them a smile? That'd be unusual.
Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear
I expect them to afford you all the deference you deserve and that they should be nice to you anyway.
LETTIE:
Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?
Couldn't even say "hello."
Or "goodbye." He's going on tour.
- Sorry, guys.
- Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle.
Don't you have somewhere to be?
- (TOM CHUCKLES)
- (QUICK FOOTSTEPS)
Anne Wheeler.
Mr. Barnum said he left a ticket for me.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I... I believe there's only supposed to be one.
No, there's meant to be two.
I wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.
MAN: Five minutes to curtain.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- (BELL DINGING)
I've always wanted to go to the theater.
MR. CARLYLE:
Phillip, is that you?
Mother. Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.
Phillip... have you no shame?
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing... but parading around with the help?
Anne.
Anne! Anne!
How dare you speak to her like that.
You forget your place, Phillip.
My Place?
Mother, if this is my place... then I don't want any part of it.
Anne.
They're small-minded people.
Why do you care what they think?
It's not just them.
You've never had somebody look at you the way your parents looked at me.
The way everyone would look at us.

Then, meeting the Queen.
Then bringing Jenny Lind, then my father the other night.
When will it ever be enough for you?
I'm doing this for Caroline and Helen.
Look around you. They have everything.
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.
No, you don't understand.
How could you?
My father was treated like dirt.
I was treated like dirt... and my children will not be.
You don't need everyone to love you, Phin.

Thomas, help me break this up.
If you've come to gloat, I wouldn't.
Tm 21:22; 'P; 'are?
I thought you'd like to know.
I never liked your show.
But I always thought the people did.
They did. They do.
Mind you, I wouldn't call it art.
Of course not.
But... putting folks of all kinds on stage with you... all colors... shapes, sizes... presenting them as equals...
Why, another critic might have even called it...
"a celebration of humanity."
I would've liked that.
Mmm.
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.
I mean, thank God for Jenny's tour.
We can borrow off the profits, we'll be fine.
You don't know?
Hmm?
I'm sorry.
Charity?
On, God, Charity.
- I am...
- I don't wanna talk to you.
N... nothing happened. This is ridiculous.
Oh, sure. Nothing happened.
It's on the cover of every paper in New York.
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!
Of course you're not.
Not with her, not with me, not with anyone.
Just you and your show.
(SCOFFS) What are you doing?
I'm going home.
This is your home.
The bank... they're evicting us.
Why didn't you ask me before...
I would've said yes.
I never minded the risk, but we always did it together.
Figured you'd end up here.
- Feeling sorry for yourself.
- (DOOR OPENS)
Folks, if you've come to get paid, the money is gone. All of it.
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.
You just don't get it.
Our own mothers were ashamed of us.
Hid us our whole lives.
Then you pull us out of the shadows.
And now you're giving up on us, too.
Maybe you are a fraud.
Maybe it was just about making a buck.
But you gave us a real family.
And the circus... that was our home.
We want our home back.

Caroline! He's here.
I would like to see my wife.
She's not here.
She's at the beach!
I brought hardship on you and our family.
You warned me... and I wouldn't listen.
I just...
I wanted to be more than I was.
I never wanted anything but the man I fell in love with.

Bank said no?
Emphatically.
Repeatedly.
I don't think there's a banker left in the country
I can fool into loaning me more money, so...
I'm really sorry to disappoint you all.
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.
- (LAUGHTER)
- PHILLIP: You know, Barnum... when I first met you...
I had an inheritance, acclaim, an invitation to every party in town.
And now, thanks to you, all that's gone.
All that's left is friendship, love, and work that I adore.
You brought joy into my life.
- LETTIE: Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.
If only the bank would take joy as collateral.
They may not... but I will.
I own 10% of the show.
Knowing who I was working for...
I had the good sense to take my cut weekly.
Phillip, I can't let you gamble it on me.
Sure you can.
LETTIE:
Don't turn sensible on us now.
PHILLIP: Partners.
Partners.
MAN: Yeah!
The only thing is...
I don't know how we're gonna afford a building.
Right. (SIGHS)
Building. We don't need a building.
Real estate in Manhattan is a terrible investment.
Why, I can get land down by the docks for almost nothing!
All we need is a tent.
