We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions.
We're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects.
While the world he inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.
No scripts, no cue cards.
Lt isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine.
Lt's a life.
L'm not going to make it.
You're going to have to go on without me.
No way, mister.
You're going to the top of this mountain, broken legs and all.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.
You're crazy, you know that?
For me, there is no difference between a private life and a public life.
My life, is my life, is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.
Lt's a noble life. lt is a truly blessed life.
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.
All right. Promise me one thing, though.
Lf I die before I reach the summit, you'll use me as an alternative source of food.
Gross.
Lt's all true. lt's all real.
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.
Lt's merely controlled.
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.
Maybe just your love handles.
L have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.
Truman. You're going to be late.
Okay!
Good morning.
Morning.
Good morning.
Ln case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
Yeah.
Morning, Truman.
Morning, Spencer.
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.
He won't hurt you.
Get down.
L know.
lt's just me.
Come on, Pluto.
What is it?
Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft in trouble began shedding parts as it flew over Seahaven just a few moments ago.
Luckily, no one was hurt.
But, hey, how do you feel today?
That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?
Nope.
No? Good.
This is Classical Clive with Classical Drive so why don't you forget about the perils of flying, settle back, and let this music calm you down?
Dog Fancy, please.
Dog Fancy.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Give me a paper there, will you, Earl?
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.
Will that be all for you, Truman?
That's the whole kit and caboodle.
Catch you later.
Okay. Yeah.
Good morning.
Hank.
Morning, Truman.
Good morning, Truman.
How are you guys?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Always.
And how's your lovely wife?
Good. How about yours?
Couldn't be better.
Fine.
Nice talking to you, Truman.
You, too.
We must go now.
Think about that policy. Okay, that's two for one. That's a good deal.
DoppelgÃ¤nger special.
Right.
Hi.
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, you first, please.
L'm not that anxious to get there.
Yes, hello.
Could I have directory assistance for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.
Truman, did you see this?
L'm sorry, ma'am.
Lf he's in a coma, he's probably uninsurable.
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?
Nothing listed?
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
"S" for Sylvia.
Nothing?
Okay. Thank you.
Lawrence.
Hey, Burbank.
Got a prospect in Wells Park l need you to close.
Wells Park?
On Harbor lsland?
You know another one?
L can't do it.
L have an appointment. Dentist.
You're going to lose a lot more than your teeth if you don't meet your quota.
Look, Truman, they're making cutbacks at the end of this month.
Cutbacks?
Yeah. Now, you need this.
Besides, a half-hour across the bay, a little sea air would do you good.
Thanks.
Hello.
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.
One-way or return?
Return.
There you go, sir.
Do you need any help, sir?
You go ahead. I'll be fine.
Yeah.
Hi, honey.
Look what I got free at the checkout.
Lt's a Chef's Pal.
Lt's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.
Never needs sharpening, dishwasher-safe.
Wow!
That's amazing.
Truman, you missed a spot.
That is a beer.
You know, l'm thinking about getting out, Marlon.
Yeah? Out of what?
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.
Off this island. Out.
Out of your job?
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.
You have a desk job.
L'd kill for a desk job.
Here you go.
You should try stocking vending machines for a living.
No, thanks.
Now there's excitement.
Don't you ever get antsy? ltchy feet?
Where's there to go?
Fiji.
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?
See here?
Yeah.
This is us, and all the way around here,
Fiji.
You can't get any further away before you start coming back.
You know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot.
So when are you going to go?
Lt's not that simple.
Lt takes money, planning.
L can't just up and go.
Right.
L'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.
Bonus time is just around the corner.
You coming for a drink?
No, I can't tonight.
L don't like the look of that weather, son.
L think we should head back.
No, Dad. Not yet.
No, come on. We should go back.
A bit farther, please?
Son, listen.
Okay.
Yes.
Daddy!
You're soaked. Where have you been?
L figure we can scrape together $8,000...
Every time you and Marlon get together...
We can bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.
You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
We have mortgage payments, Truman.
We have car payments.
What, we're just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
Lt would be an adventure.
L thought we were going to try for a baby. lsn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait. I want to get away.
See some of the world, explore.
Honey, you want to be an explorer?
This'll pass.
We all think like this now and then.
Let's get you out of these wet clothes, come to bed.
You never see anything anyway.
They always turn the camera and play music and, you know, the wind blows in, and the curtains move and you don't see anything.
Dog Fancy, please.
Dog Fancy.
Thank you.
Paper, Earl, please.
Paper.
L might as well pick one of these up while l'm at it.
For the wife?
She's got to have them.
Anything else, Truman?
That's the whole ball of wax.
Catch you later.
Okay.
Dad?
What are you doing?
What the... Get out of the way!
Stop them!
Stop those people!
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!
Somebody, stop the bus!
And wasn't it funny... lt doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.
L see him 10 times a week in 100 different faces.
L almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
Lt was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.
And you know what else was strange?
A businessman and a woman with a little dog came out of nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Lt's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown before we become just like the rest of the country.
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...
God!
L'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.
Did Dad have a brother?
Truman, you know perfectly well that your father was an only child, just like you.
Now, sweetie, you're just feeling bad because of what happened.
You, sailing off into that storm.
But l've never blamed you, Truman, and I don't blame you now.
Truman?
What are you doing down here?
Fixing the mower.
Saw my father today.
L know.
Your mother called.
You really shouldn't upset her like that.
Did you want... What did you want?
L made macaroni.
L'm not hungry.
You know, you really ought to throw out that mower.
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.
What's he doing?
See, they got rid of her, but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
You okay? You all right?
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
L'm so sorry I fell on you like that.
lt's okay.
L've just been such a klutz all day.
Lt's all right.
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
L'm so sorry.
l'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
l'm Meryl.
Hi, l'm Truman.
Hey, nice to meet you.
Truman, you've studied enough.
No. I got to commit this to memory.
Come on, Truman, one ice-cold brewski.
Come on.
You're going to have to copy off me, so be careful.
You're a better person than I am.
See you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
See you later, loser.
Hi.
Konnichi-wa.
What?
You take Japanese.
Yes.
Lauren, right?
Lt's on the...
Lauren. Right.
L'm Truman Burbank.
Yeah, I know.
You know, Truman, l'm not allowed to talk to you.
Really?
Yeah. I can understand that.
L'm a pretty dangerous character.
L'm sorry. lt's not up to me.
A girl's got to be careful.
You have a boyfriend, right?
No, it's not that.
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...
We're just friends.
lt's nothing like that.
Lt's how I look?
Not your type?
No.
L like your pin.
L was wondering that myself.
Would you want to maybe, possibly, sometime go out for some pizza or something?
Like, Friday?
Saturday?
L can't.
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?
We have finals tomorrow.
Yeah, I know.
Lf we don't go now, it won't happen.
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?
Please keep your hands inside the car!
This is my favorite pizza place.
Tony!
One large, extra plankton.
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.
Who are?
They don't want me talking to you.
Then don't talk.
They're here.
Truman.
What do they want?
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.
Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?
Everybody's pretending.
L don't know.
No, my name's not Lauren. lt's Sylvia.
My name's Sylvia.
Sylvia?
Yeah.
Lauren, sweetheart, not again.
Wait a minute. Who are you?
L'm her father.
l've never even seen him before.
We weren't doing anything.
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.
Everything l've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. lt's all for you.
l don't understand.
The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.
Lt's a show.
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.
l want to know what's going on.
Schizophrenia. She has episodes.
We've tried everything.
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.
Truman!
You're not the first.
You're not the first. She brings all her boyfriends down here.
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.
Get out of here. Come and find me.
Don't worry.
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.
Fiji?
Sylvia!
Hey!
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.
Maybe he's too kind.
L can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Excuse me.
Come on, Sal.
We've already got this on the greatest hits tape.
Can I borrow that?
Close, but no cigar.
And it's another beautiful day in paradise, folks, but don't forget to buckle up out there in radioland.
Remember, a good driver... wait for the cue.
Stand by, one.
Countdown to action.
Stand by, one.
He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.
He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.
Okay, he's making his turn onto Lancaster Square.
Oh, my God! He nearly hit her.
Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.
Sorry about that, folks.
L guess we picked up a police frequency or something.
Lt sometimes happens, and it can drive you crazy.
Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here and we've still got some great music up ahead, but don't forget to buckle up.
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.
A safe driver is what? Yes...
Morning, ma'am.
l love that idea.
Lt's pretty cool, isn't it?
Can I help?
Yeah. I have an appointment at Gable Enterprises.
They went bust.
What's happening?
Nothing.
Just tell me what's happening.
Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?
Lt's none of your business!
Lf you don't tell me what's happening, l'll report you!
You're trespassing.
Marlon.
Truman. What are you doing here?
L got to talk to you.
Lt's a bad time, okay? l'm way behind.
L'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.
You okay? You look like shit.
L think l'm mixed up in something.
Mixed up in what?
There's no point trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening.
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.
L looked out. There was people there.
And on the radio on the way to work, it starts following me along, talking about everything that l'm doing.
Know what I mean?
Truman, this is one of your fantasies... l think this is about my dad.
Your dad?
L think he's alive.
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
L'm definitely being followed.
Who?
Lt's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.
How about those two?
L don't know. Could be.
Lt's when l'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.
Did anything happen?
No.
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?
No. I just came here.
Come on.
L told you I can't.
You're going to get both our asses fired, you know that?
Okay, man, let's do it.
What?
Whatever you say, l'm game.
What are you talking about?
Yes, sirree.
Your birthday comes but once a year.
Maybe l'm being set up for something.
You ever think about that, Marlon?
Like your whole life has been building toward something?
No.
When you were hauling chickens in the summer for Kaiser, what was the furthest you ever got off the island?
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.
Look at that sunset, Truman.
Lt's perfect.
Yeah.
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Yep.
Just between you and me, Marlon, l'm going away for a while.
Really?
Yeah.
Little angel.
My little clown.
Old carrot top.
The best of both of us.
We should be getting you home, Mother.
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.
Do you remember, Truman, when Dad was still with us?
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.
Lt looks so small.
Things always do when you look back, darling.
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives. Look.
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?
She still does.
And there's lots of pages left over for baby photos.
L would like to hold a grandchild in my arms before I go.
Angela, we really should be getting you home.
l'll take her.
No. You stay, relax.
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.
You sure?
Besides, we have something to discuss.
A certain person's birthday.
L see.
And there'll be another episode of l Love Lucy same time tomorrow.
But right now, it's time for Golden Oldies.
Tonight, we present the enduring, much-loved classic,
Show Me the Way to Go Home.
A hymn of praise to small-town life, where we learn that you don't have to leave home to discover what the world's all about, and that no one is poor who has friends.
Full of laughter and love, pain and sadness, but ultimately redemption, we share the trials and tribulations of the Abbott family.
Note the touching performance of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.
That scene with the bowl of cherries is going to have you splitting your sides with laughter all over again.
And there'll be tears, too, when David and Jennifer are reunited.
But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.
Thank you, sweetie.
L need to talk to you, but let's go outside.
Sweetie, l'd love to, but l'm really late.
What's your rush?
Surgery.
There was that elevator disaster downtown. lt was on the news last night.
This cable just snapped.
This elevator, it just plummeted down 10 flights.
The non-union workers. Just monsters.
That building, it's right next door to where you work.
Can you imagine if you had been in there?
Lt's not even worth thinking about.
Anyway, I have an amputation on one of the young women who was in that elevator.
She's very young. lt's very sad.
Anyway, wish me luck.
L'll cross my fingers for you.
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?
Yes. l'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. lt's very important.
L'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.
Sure. Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?
L'll try.
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji, and that I'll call her when I get there?
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Fine. I'll tell her.
Thank you so much.
Sorry.
Lt's okay.
Here, let me help you with that.
He's here.
L know.
Scalpel.
L'm now making my primary incision just above the right knee.
Hold her.
Nicely done.
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family... lt's just beautiful. Beautiful job.
L'll just let someone else tidy up here.
l'm sorry to keep you.
That's okay.
How can I help?
L would like to book a flight to Fiji.
When would you like to leave?
Today.
L'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
A month?
Lt's the busy season.
You want to book the flight?
Lt doesn't matter.
L'll make other arrangements, okay?
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!
Thank you.
Windy city, here we come.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello. Hi.
Sisters.
Mom, isn't that...
Face the front.
Everybody off. We've got a problem.
L'm sorry, son.
His father was from Chicago, wasn't he?
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.
But how come he wants to go to Chicago?
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.
He has to have it out with Meryl.
Truman?
Honey, are you okay?
Get in.
Truman.
Look.
What?
L predict that in just a moment, we will see a lady on a red bike, followed by a man with flowers and a Volkswagen Beetle with a dented fender.
Truman, please.
Look.
Lady, flowers, and...
Truman, this is silly.
There it is!
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!
Don't you want to know how I did that?
L'll tell you.
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.
Round and round.
L invited Rita and Marlon for a barbecue on Sunday.
l'm gonna make my potato salad.
L won't be here Sunday.
L need you to remind me we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word l'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. ls that it?
Okay, go.
L think you should save for a few months, and then go.
There. Are you happy now?
L'm going to go take a shower.
Let's go now.
L'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?
Truman, what are you doing?
Truman!
Where shall we go?
Truman, where are we going?
L don't really know.
L guess l'm being spontaneous.
Somebody, help me!
L'm being spontaneous!
Forget Fiji.
Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
No.
What about Atlantic City?
No, you hate to gamble.
That's right, I do, don't l?
So why would you want to go there?
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?
Truman, I think l'm going to throw up.
Me, too.
Blocked at every turn.
Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You're blaming me for the traffic?
Should l?
Truman, let's go home.
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.
Lt could be like this all the way to Atlantic City.
Let's go back.
L'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
Can you please slow down?
Yes, I can.
Truman, that's our turnoff.
L changed my mind again.
What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras!
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.
Lt's magic.
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.
You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own.
L think l'd like a little company.
Truman, you knew this would happen.
You know you can't drive over water.
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.
Give me your hand.
Sweetie.
Drive.
Truman!
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!
Oh, my!
You can do it.
Please, don't!
You can make it.
Truman.
We're over.
We're over the bridge.
We're over?
We're over the bridge.
We're over.
Truman, what about that sign?
L'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?
Truman, let's go back!
Can't go back!
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!
lt's okay.
We're on fire!
Lt's okay. lt's just smoke.
You okay?
Yes.
Want to do it again?
No!
Truman, stop! Oh, God!
So what are we going to do for money when we get to New Orleans?
L have my Seahaven bank card.
So what? We're just gonna eat into our savings, is that it?
L'm going to have to call your mother when we get there.
She's going to be worried sick. I don't know how she's going to take this.
What now?
This is a red alert.
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.
Back up. Leak at the plant.
We had to shut her down.
Ls there any way around?
Whole area's being evacuated.
Ls there anything I can do?
No, ma'am.
Thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
Truman.
Truman!
Truman, come back!
Stop him!
Truman!
Catch him on the left!
Stay away!
No.
Now in custody.
Thank you both so much for your help.
L really appreciate it.
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.
L understand.
Thanks again.
Good night.
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're not well.
Why do you want to have a baby with me?
You can't stand me.
That's not true.
Why don't you let me fix you some of this new Mococoa drink?
All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.
No artificial sweeteners.
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you talking to?
L've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.
What the hell does this have to do with anything?
Tell me what's happening!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You're part of this, aren't you?
Truman.
Meryl!
You are scaring me.
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?
There are so many choices!
Do something!
What?
What did you say?
Who were you talking to?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
L didn't say anything.
You said "do something."
No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.
Talk to me!
L don't know anything. Please stop.
Stay where you are.
Truman?
Truman.
Oh, thank God!
How can anyone expect me to carry on under these conditions?
Lt's unprofessional.
Lt's okay.
Everything's going to be okay.
Lt's all gonna be fine.
L don't know what to think, Marlon.
Maybe l'm losing my mind, but... lt feels like the whole world revolves around me somehow.
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.
Sure that's not wishful thinking?
You wishing you'd made something more out of yourself?
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john, had an imaginary interview on Seahaven Tonight?
Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.
L've been your best friend since we were 7 years old, Truman.
The only way you and l ever made it through school was by cheating off each other's test papers.
Jesus, they were identical.
But I always felt safe knowing that.
'Cause whatever the answer was, we were right together, and we were wrong together.
Remember that time I stayed up with you all night in your tent because you wanted to play North Pole?
And I got pneumonia?
You remember that?
You were out of school for about a month.
You're the closest thing I ever had to a brother, Truman.
L know that things haven't really worked out for either of us like we used to dream they would.
L know that feeling, when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it, so you look for answers somewhere else, but...
The point is, l'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.
The point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you, Truman.
And the last thing l'd ever do is lie to you.
And the last thing that I would ever do is lie to you.
L mean, think about it, Truman.
Lf everybody is in on it, l'd have to be in on it, too.
L'm not in on it, Truman, because there is no "it."
You were right about one thing, though.
What's that?
The thing that started all this.
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.
That's why I came by tonight.
L'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.
Go to him.
Easy on the fog.
Stand by, crane cam.
Crane cam.
Button cam 3.
L never stopped believing.
And wide, curb cam 8.
My son.
Move in for a close-up?
No.
Move back and fade up music.
And now go in close.
All those years wasted.
L'll make it up to you, son. I swear.
Dad.
Yes!
Bravo.
That will win the ratings period.
Congratulations.
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.
Great television.
That was good work.
Let's get some champagne up here.
Congratulations.
Well done, Christof.
Lt was brilliant. lt just broke my heart.
Well done, everyone!
Bravo!
Congratulations.
1.7 billion were there for his birth.
220 countries tuned in for his first step.
The world stood still for that stolen kiss.
And as he grew, so did the technology.
An entire human life recorded on an intricate network of hidden cameras and broadcast live and unedited,
24 hours a day, seven days a week, to an audience around the globe.
Coming to you now from Seahaven island, enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed, and along with the Great Wall of China, one of only two manmade structures visible from space, now in its 30th great year, it's The Truman Show.
What a week it's been.
L don't know about you, l was on pins and needles the entire time.
Hello and good evening.
L'm your host Mike Michaelson, and welcome to Trutalk.
Our forum for issues growing out of the show.
But tonight, something very special indeed.
A rare and exclusive interview with the show's conceiver and creator.
So come with us now as we go live to the lunar room on the 221 st floor of the omni-cam ecosphere.
That's where we'll find the world's greatest tele-visionary.
The designer and architect of the world within a world that is Seahaven lsland: Christof.
Before we begin, l'd like to thank you on behalf of our audience, for granting this exclusive interview.
We know how demanding your schedule is and we all know how jealously you guard your privacy.
This, sir, is indeed an honor.
Don't mention it.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events on the show has been Truman's father, Kirk, and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that, l think it's worth noting this is not the first time someone from the outside has attempted to reach Truman, is it?
We have had our close calls in the past.
Truman! lt's television! Yes!
Yes! I did it! l'm on The Truman Show!
But there's never been anything to compare with this most recent breach in security.
The first intruder to be a former cast member.
A dead one at that.
Got to say, writing Kirk back in, masterstroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, l came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Truman!
Truman, no!
That's off-limits.
Why? What's over there?
Nothing. lt's dangerous. That's all.
You've got to know your limitations, Truman.
But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.
As Truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island.
L'd like to be an explorer, like the great Magellan.
You're too late.
There's really nothing left to explore.
Finally, I came up with the concept of Kirk's drowning.
Most effective. Truman's been terrified of the water ever since.
When Kirk read the synopsis for the Death At Sea episode, he was disappointed, to say the least.
L'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set.
But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence?
Amnesia.
Brilliant.
Let's take some viewer phone calls.
Charlotte, North Carolina, you're on with Christof.
Yeah, hi, Christof.
L was just wondering how many cameras you got there in that town.
Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.
That's a lot of cameras.
Remember, we started with just one.
He was curious from birth.
Premature by two weeks. lt was almost as if he couldn't wait to get started.
And his eagerness to leave his mother's womb was the very reason he was the one who was selected.
Ln competition with five other unwanted pregnancies, the casting of a show, determined by an air date,
Truman was the one who arrived on cue.
Lncidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation.
That's correct.
The show has generated enormous revenues, now equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
People forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running.
Since the show is on 24 hours a day without commercial interruption, all those staggering revenues are generated by product placement.
That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.
From the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in.
All of it available in the Truman catalog and operators are standing by.
Christof, let me ask you.
Why do you think that Truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now?
We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.
Lt's as simple as that.
The Hague for Christof.
Hello? The Hague?
All right, we've lost that call. Let's go to Hollywood. You're on Trutalk.
Hi, l'd just like to say one thing.
You're a liar and a manipulator.
And what you've done to Truman is sick.
We remember this voice, don't we?
How could we forget?
Let's go to another call.
No. lt's fine, Mike.
L love to reminisce with former members of the cast.
Sylvia, as you announced so melodramatically to the world, you think because you batted your eyes at Truman once, flirted with him, stole a few minutes of airtime with him to thrust yourself and your politics into the limelight, that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?
You really think you're in a position to judge him?
What right do you have to take a baby and turn his life into some kind of mockery?
Don't you ever feel guilty?
L have given Truman a chance to lead a normal life.
The world, the place you live in, is the sick place.
Seahaven is the way the world should be.
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!
He could leave at any time.
Lf his was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him.
L think what distresses you, really, caller, is that ultimately
Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.
That's where you're wrong.
You're so wrong, and he'll prove you wrong.
Aside from the heated comments of a very vocal minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience.
Yes. For Truman and for the viewing public.
Christof, I can't thank you enough for giving so generously of your time tonight.
L think it's safe to say that now that this crisis is behind us and that Truman's back to his old self, we can look forward to some exciting new developments.
Mike, the big news is that Meryl will be leaving Truman in an upcoming episode.
And a new romantic interest will be introduced.
L'm determined that television's first on-air conception will still take place.
Another television milestone straight ahead. You heard it here first.
Lt has been a singular honor and a pleasure, sir.
Christof, thank you.
Thank you, Mike.
Simeon.
What?
Ls he looking at us?
Jesus, do you think he knows?
Hello?
Better call Christof.
Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.
Jesus.
He's back to his old self.
Thank God.
That's an unusual cat, my man.
L hereby proclaim this planet...
Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.
ls he gonna go?
Okay, hallway camera ready.
That one's for free.
Keep up with him,
'cause he'll move fast.
Stand by, all house cameras.
Morning!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Ln case I don't see you...
Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
Good afternoon...
Good morning.
Evening and good night.
Morning, Truman.
Morning, Spencer.
How's it going?
Let me check.
Vital signs are good.
Pluto!
Good morning, Truman.
Look who's here.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Every single day.
The policy, we've thought about it and we're gonna take it.
You're kidding?
No!
Why don't we go up to my office right now and we'll sign the papers?
Next week would be much better.
All right. See you guys.
Okay, bye now. See you next week.
Give me something to look forward to.
You got it.
See, this isn't about insurance.
This is about the great variable: when will death occur?
Could be a week, a month, a year.
Could be today.
"Sunbather, minding his own business,
"stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella."
No way to guard against that kind of thing.
Sorry, excuse me.
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.
The two of you are gonna be neighbors.
L guess what l'm saying is that life is fragile.
Vivien, your office.
Sorry.
What's that? l'm sorry.
You do?
Great. Let me take your information.
Ready, 2. Go to 2.
And back to medium.
And wide.
L was just trying to train the kid to...
Never mind.
What's he doing in the basement?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why wasn't I told?
Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.
He's just sleeping, I thought.
This the best shot we've got?
What's to see?
What's on the clock cam?
Lt's an obstruction.
What happened down there?
He was just tidying up his garbage.
L was gonna call you, but halfway through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.
L wanna check on the setups for the insurance convention tomorrow.
Yes.
Yeah.
Nice move.
There you go.
Lsolate the audio.
Give me a close-up on his torso.
He's still breathing.
Where's Chloe? Call him.
What do you want me to say?
Tell him it's a wrong number.
What took you so long?
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.
Here. What's going on?
L don't know. They're...
He came down into the room. He did nothing but stand around for a while.
Shut up and watch it.
Then we went to night vision.
He's asleep.
There!
What?
Zoom in.
On which?
Under the chair there.
Enhance it.
ls it...
My God.
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.
Get Marlon over there.
Right away.
Truman!
Surprise party!
Come on, buddy.
L got a six-pack of cold brewskis with our name on them.
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.
Shit.
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
That's good. Keep it light.
L know you're in here.
L'm gonna find you.
Check under the table.
The closet, behind you.
Huh.
Gee.
L wonder where he could possibly be.
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.
He's gone.
Cut transmission!
Cut transmission?
Cut it!
Jesus! God in heaven!
Everything's black.
Give me the phone.
L don't know where he is, but he's gone.
All right. We've got every available extra looking for him.
The principals are helping out. The crew, too. So every sector's covered.
What about prop cars?
Yes, they've been accounted for.
He has to be on foot.
He has the world's most recognizable face. He can't disappear.
Go.
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.
Good dog!
All this fuss.
Lf he could just hear my voice.
Truman!
Let me try. Truman!
Lt's me, Dad!
Let's talk.
Yeah, I know.
Just about done with the square.
Got to go back to Barrymore, check the interiors.
He's got to be in there.
Barrymore.
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?
L don't know.
Send somebody over there, okay?
All right.
Take another man and get down there now, all right?
L don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.
Get some batteries.
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.
L don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.
What time is it?
Lt's way too early for that.
Cue the sun.
What time is it?
Christof, what's going on?
Did you know there's a rumor circulating that he's dead?
You hear me?
The media is having a feeding frenzy over this.
All the phone lines are jammed, and every network has a pirated shot of Marlon making an ass of himself in front of the camera.
The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.
Why? We're getting higher ratings with this graphic than we've ever had on this show.
No sign of him.
Marlon, why don't you head back to town and join the others?
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.
Everyone's at first positions, right?
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.
We're not watching the sea.
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?
Sweep the harbor.
Bring up the harbor cameras.
Shift all harbor cameras to computer, please.
Some of those are out, aren't they?
Yeah. We have four of them down, but we have the lighthouse cameras up.
All buoy cams, please.
What's happening?
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.
Why are we looking at the water?
Good.
Pan and zoom please.
Truman, where are you going?
How can he sail? He's in insurance.
lsn't he terrified of the water?
Resume transmission.
Resuming transmission.
l got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
L want a piece of that.
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
Just leave them in the car.
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't see his face. Go to the cabin cam.
There. Perfect.
That's our hero shot.
Let's get another boat out there.
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk to the guys on the ferry.
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.
Come on.
l'm usually the bus driver.
Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.
They're actors.
How do we stop him?
Okay.
We're going to be accessing the weather program now.
So hold onto your hats. You got that?
No. I think we're gonna want to localize the storm over the boat.
You can get the coordinates for that.
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.
Thar she blows.
Come on.
Give me some lightning.
Again.
Hit him again!
For God's sake, the whole world is watching.
We can't let him die in front of a live audience.
He was born in front of a live audience.
Come on, Truman!
You can do it! Hold on!
Ls that the best you can do?
You're gonna have to kill me!
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
l demand that you cease transmission.
Keep running.
What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?
Lncrease the wind.
l'm telling you for the last time.
How close is he?
Very close.
Capsize him. Tip him over.
Damn you, Christof!
You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!
Shut up!
He's gonna drown, and he doesn't even care.
Do it.
No.
Do it!
That's enough.
L want to talk to him.
Truman.
You can speak.
L can hear you.
Who are you?
L am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Then who am l?
You're the star.
Was nothing real?
You were real.
That's what made you so good to watch.
Listen to me, Truman.
There's no more truth out there than there is in the world l created for you.
The same lies, the same deceit.
But in my world you have nothing to fear.
L know you better than you know yourself.
You never had a camera in my head.
You're afraid.
That's why you can't leave.
Lt's okay, Truman.
L understand.
L have been watching you your whole life.
L was watching when you were born.
L was watching when you took your first step.
L watched you on your first day of school.
The episode when you lost your first tooth.
You can't leave, Truman.
Please, God.
You belong here...
You can do it.
With me.
Talk to me.
Say something.
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.
You're live to the whole world.
Ln case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
Yeah.
Yeah!
He made it! Yeah!
All right, Truman!
Cease transmission.
Ceasing transmission.
You want another slice?
No. l'm okay.
