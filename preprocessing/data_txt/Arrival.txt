Everything you do in there,
I have to explain to a room full of men whose first and last question is...
"How can this be used against us?"
So you're gonna have to give me more than that.
Kangaroo.
What is that?
In 1770,
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground off the coast of Australia, and he led a party into the country, and they met the Aboriginal people.
One of the sailors pointed at the animals that hop around and put their babies in their pouch, and he asked what they were, and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."
And the point is?
<font color="#404040"><font color="#404040">LOUISE:</font></font> It wasn't till later that they learned that
"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,
I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there.

Okay, the nature of a request for information along with a response.
Then, we need to clarify the difference between a specific "you" and a collective "you," because we don't wanna know why Joe Alien is here, we want to know why they all landed.
And purpose requires an understanding of intent.
We need to find out: do they make conscious choices?
Or is their motivation so instinctive that they don't understand a "why" question at all?
And... And biggest of all, we need to have enough vocabulary with them that we understand their answer.

<font color="#404040">IAN:</font> Here are some of the many things we don't know about heptapods.
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."
Seven feet. Heptapod.
Who are they?
Trying to answer this in any meaningful way is hampered by the fact that, outside being able to see them and hear them, the heptapods leave absolutely no footprint.
The chemical composition of their spaceship is unknown.
The shell emits no waste, no gas, no radiation.
Assuming that the shells communicate with each other, they do so without detection.
The air between the shells is untroubled by sonic emission or light wave.
Are they scientists? Or tourists?
If they're scientists, they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.
Why did they park where they did?
The world's most decorated experts can't crack that one.
The most plausible theory is that they chose places on Earth with the lowest incidence of lightning strikes.
But there are exceptions.
The next most plausible theory is that
Sheena Easton had a hit song at each of these sites in 1980.
So, we just don't know.
How do they communicate?
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.
The first breakthrough was to discover that there's no correlation between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.
Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.
Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted opportunity, passing up a second communications channel.
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank for their study of how heptapods write, because unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.
Like their ship or their bodies, their written language has no forward or backward direction.
Linguists call this non-linear orthography, which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands, starting from either side.
You would have to know each word you wanted to use, as well as how much space they would occupy.
A heptapod can write a complex sentence in two seconds, effortlessly.
It's taken us a month to make the simplest reply.
Next, expanding vocabulary.
Louise thinks it could easily take another month to be ready for that.

You're gonna see him this weekend.

I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.

I know something that's going to happen.
I can't explain how I know. I just do.
And when I told your daddy, he got really mad.
And he said I made the wrong choice.
What? What's going to happen?
It has to do with a really rare disease.
And it's unstoppable.

We're done here!
We're taking this with us.
I can read it.
- I know what it is.
- What?
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.
The weapon is their language.
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.
If you learn it, when you really learn it, you begin to perceive time the way that they do, so you can see what's to come.
But time, it isn't the same for them.
It's non-linear.

General Shang, the pleasure is mine, really.
Your president said he was honored to host me at the celebration...
Yeah.
...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.
18 months ago, you did something remarkable, something not even my superior has done.
And what's that?
You changed my mind.
You're the reason for this unification, all because you reached out to me at my private number.
Your private number?
General, I... I don't know your private number.
Now you know.
I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I believe it was important for you to see that.
I called you, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
