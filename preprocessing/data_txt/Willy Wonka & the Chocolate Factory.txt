All right, all right, what's it going to be?
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!
- Wonka's got a new one today.
ALL: What is it?
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?
- Do you ask a fish how it swims?
- No.
- Or a bird how it flies?
- No.
No, you don't.
They were born to do it.
Just like Willy Wonka was born to be a Candy man... and you were born to be a Wonkerer.

Hi, Mr. Jopeck.
Ah, come along, Charlie.
You're late.
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.
You're right.
- There you are.
- Thanks.
- Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
- Okay.
[BELL RINGING]
<i>MAN: Up the airy mountain.</i>
<i>Down the rushing g/en.</i>
<i>We dare not go a-hunting.</i>
<i>For fear of little men.</i>
You see... nobody ever goes in... and nobody ever comes out.
Charlie's late.
He works too hard, for a little boy.
He should have some time to play.
Not enough hours in the day.
With you four bedridden the last 20 years... it takes a lot of work to keep this family going.
If only his father were alive.
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.
In all the years you've been saying that...
I've yet to see you set foot on the floor.
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...
Hi, everybody!
Wake up, Charlie's home!
Grandpa George.
Grandma Georgina.
Grandma Josephine.
Grandpa Joe!
Is this your supper, Grandpa?
It's yours too.
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!
GEORGINA: It's all we have!
JOE: What are you saying?
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?
What difference does it make where? He got it.
My first payday-
Good for you, Charlie.
We'll have a real banquet.
Mom?
Here's what's left. You keep it.
Except for this.
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.
When bread looks like a banquet,
I have no right buying tobacco.
Go on, Grandpa.
Please take it.
CHARLIE: After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.
There was this strange man there.
I think he was a tinker.
He was standing behind me looking at the factory.
Just before he left, he said:
"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out."
And right he was, Charlie.
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka looked it.
Why'd he lock it?
Because all the other chocolate makers were sending spies... dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.
Especially Slugworth.
Oh, that Slugworth was the worst!
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!
Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.
He looked the gates and vanished completely.
And then, suddenly, about three years later... the most amazing thing happened.
The factory started working again, full blast!
And more delicious candies were coming out than ever.
But the gates stayed looked so that no one... not even Slugworth, could steal them.
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.
Thousands must be.
But who?
Who are they?
That is the biggest mystery of them all.
- Charlie Bucket?
CHARLIE: Yes, Mr. Turkentine?
- Charlie Bucket?
CHARLIE: Yes, Mr. Turkentine?
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.
We have nitric acid, glycerine... and a special mixture of my own.
Together it's dangerous stuff, blows you up.
But mixed together right, as only I know how, what's it make?
- I don't know.
- Of course not. Only I know.
If you knew, you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you.
And for a student to teach his teacher is presumptuous. Is that clear?
- CHARLIE: Yes, sir.
- Good.
[CHILDREN GIGGLING]
Mixed together in the right way, these dangerous ingredients... make the finest wart remover in the world.
The trick is to pour equal amounts.
Charlie, you take the nitric acid and glycerine... and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?
Good lad. Pour.
[EXPLOSION]
[CHEERING]
Did we do it wrong?
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.
What's going on out there?
[CHATTERING]
Come here. What's happening?
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!
Are you sure?
He's giving lots of chocolate away!
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!
Class un-dismissed.
He hid five Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.
- Where did he hide them?
- Inside five Wonka Bars.
- You gotta buy bars to find them!
- Class re-dismissed!
- You gotta buy bars to find them!
- Class re-dismissed!
BOY 1: I'll meet you downstairs!
BOY 2:
I'm gonna buy the whole store!
MAN <i>[ON TV]:
Now, details on the announcement...</i> that has captured the world's attention.
Hidden among the billions of Wonka Bars... are five gold tickets.
To the five people who find them will come the most fabulous prize ever:
A lifetime supply of chocolate.
<i>If this were not enough, each winner, before receiving his prize...</i> will be personally escorted...
They're all crazy.
Shh. The man's a genius.
He'll sell a million bars.
Do you think I've got a Chance to find one?
One? I'm counting on you to find all five!
One's enough for me.
MAN [ON TV]: We <i>have</i> reports...
<i>that the response is phenomenal.
Wonka Bars are selling...</i>
<i>at a rate to boggle the mind.</i>
<i>It is incredible...</i> the <i>way Wonkamania has descended upon the globe.</i>
<i>While the world searches, we watch and wait, wondering...</i>
<i>where it will lead, and how long the spirit of man will hold</i> up...
<i>under the strain.</i>
I still have these dreams, doctor.
And I still can't stop believing them.
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder... to believe in dreams is a manifestation of insanity.
The sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll get well.
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.
What did he say?
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.
- You said...
- Shut up! Where's the ticket?
We begin with five Golden Tickets.
We begin with five Golden Tickets.
Like five lucky bolts of lightning ready to strike any point on the map.
No one knew where or when the first one would hit.
But last night we got our answer.
While America slept, the first Golden Ticket was found... in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.
We've been waiting for the story, and we're ready with a live report.
Proud we are, for the attention of the world... focuses today here in Duselheim.
A community thrust into prominence... by the discovery of the first Wonka Golden Ticket.
Its finder is the son of a prominent butcher.
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!
Augustus Gloop, the pride of
Duselheim, the fame of Western Germany.
An example for the whole world.
How does it feel to be the first Golden Ticket finder?
- Hungm.
- Any other feelings?
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...
Mrs. Gloop, would you say a few words to the audience?
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.
He wouldn't do it unless he needed the nourishment.
ALL: Happy birthday, Charlie!
ALL: Happy birthday, Charlie!
Here you are, Charlie.
Thank you.
It's terrific!
We each knitted a bit: Grandmas
Georgina and Josephine, and me.
I did the end pieces with the tassels.
And here's a little gift from Grandpa George and me.
I think I know what this is.
- It is! A Wonka!
JOE: Open it, Charlie.
Let's see that Golden Ticket.
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- It's not fair to raise his hopes.
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!
MRS. BUCKET: Stop it.
- I've got the same Chance as anybody.
JOE: You've got more.
You want it more.
Go on, open it!
Here goes.
- I got it!
- Where?
Let's see!
Fooled you, didn't I?
You thought I really had it.
Never mind, Charlie.
You'll find one.
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!
JOSEPHINE: No, no, no.
GEORGE: No.
GIRL: <i>I wanted to be the first to find</i> a <i>Golden Ticket, Daddy!</i>
MAN: <i>I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.</i>
I've got every girl on staff hunting for you.
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!
Give me time!
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?
For five days now, the entire factory's been on the job!
They haven't shelled a peanut since Monday!
They've been shelling chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!
Make them work nights!
Come along, you girls!
Put a jerk in it, or you'll be out on your ears!
And listen, the first girl... that finds a Golden Ticket gets a one-pound bonus in her pay packet!
What do you think of that?!
[CHEERING]
VERUCA: They're not even trying!
They don't want to find it!
They're jealous!
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.
Nineteen thousand bars an hour they're shelling.
Seven hundred and sixty thousand they've done so far!
You promised!
You promised I'd have it the first day!
You're going to be very unpopular if you don't deliver soon.
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.
I won't talk to you!
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!
I won't go to school!
Veruca, sweetheart, angel.
There are only four tickets left in the world... and the whole world's hunting for them!
- What can I do?
WOMAN: L got it!
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!
VERUCA:
About time too! I want it!
Give me that ticket! It's mine!
I found the Golden Ticket!
Thank God for that.
Aye. Happiness is what counts with children.
Happiness and harmony.
MAN: This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...
MAN: This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc... the mad craze that's sweeping the world.
Whatever corner of the globe we are in, whichever continent we're on... the great Wonka Bar search continues. We're near the end... of <i>our 43rd day in the Golden Ticket hunt.</i>
<i>Everywhere are signs of anxiety.</i>
<i>Every hour...</i>
<i>new shipments are sent around the globe...</i>
<i>but they're not moving fast enough.</i>
As <i>time passes, the men who seek them become more and more desperate.</i>
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've been during these last few days.
But now I think I can safely say... that your time and money have been well spent.
We're about to witness the greatest miracle of the machine age.
Based on a revolutionary law of probability, this machine... will tell us the precise location of the three remaining...
Golden Tickets.

Though we do envy him, whoever he is... and might be tempted to be bitter at our losing... we must remember there are more important things.
Many more important things.
Offhand, I can't think of what they are, but I'm sure there's something.
And now for tomorrow's weather...
CHARLIE: Why did you wake me up,

Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.
I told you, I've given it up.
Go on, open it!
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.
No, you do it. I can't.
We're going to be lucky this time.
I've got a funny feeling inside.
Which end shall I open first?
That end. Just a tiny bit.

I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.
Which means Friday's test on what we learned during the week... will now be on Monday, before we've learned it.
Since today's Tuesday, it doesn't matter.
Pencils ready!
Today, we are going to learn about... percentages.
For example, let's take the recent unpleasantness.
Suppose there were
1000 Wonka Bars in the world... and you each opened a certain number of them.
That number is... a percent. Understand?
[ALL MUMBLING]
Madeline, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?
About 100.
There are 10 hundreds in 1000, therefore, you opened 10 percent.
Peter Goff, how many did you open?
A hundred and fifty.
That's 10 percent half over again, which makes 15 percent. Charlie?
- How many did you open?
- Two.
That's easy. 200 is twice...
Not 200.
Just two.
What do you mean, you only opened two?
I don't care much for chocolate.
I can't figure out just two!
Let's pretend you opened 200.
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars, apart from being dreadfully sick... you'd use 20 percent of 1000... which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...
[CHARLIE CLEARS TH ROAT]
- Hi.
- I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.
Yeah, sure.
What kind?
A Slugworth Sizzler?

A new house for your family... food and comfort for the rest of their lives.
And don't forget the name...

I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar and the ticket was in it!
- Charlie.
- Look at it! See for yourself!
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket..." from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present this ticket at the factory gates... at 10:00 in the morning,

Hey, Mom, we're on TV!
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!
How do I look?
- You guys ready?
MAN: You're on.
This is the big day.
The day Willy Wonka opens his gates to shower gifts on the lucky winners.
From all over the globe people have gathered, waiting... to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.
Hi, friends! Don't forget to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?
MAN: Come on over here.
Bring the Cables over this way.
Come on, quick.
Hey, give me a break.
Let me get a shot.
I want to go in first, before anybody.
Anything you say.
Save some room for later,
Augustus, <i>liebling.</i>
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.
We're gonna see the greatest of them all, Mr. Willy Wonka!

[CROWD CHEERING]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Welcome, my friends.
Welcome to my chocolate factory.
Would you come forward?
Get back! Come on, Veruca!
That's Slugworth, the man I told you about.
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.
I'm so glad you could come.
This is going to be such an exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.
I think you will.
Please show your Golden Tickets.
I'm Veruca Salt.
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!
You look pretty in that mink Coat!
I've got three others.
And Mr. Salt. Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?
Augustus Gloop.
Augustus, my dear boy!
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.
What kind of gum you got?
- Charming! Charming!
- Sam Beauregarde here!
What a genuine pleasure.
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"
I'm Mike Teevee.
Wham, you're dead!
Wonderful to meet you!
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.
- Charlie Bucket.
- Well, well. Charlie Bucket.
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And Who's this?
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.
Delighted.
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.
Are we ready? Yes! Good!
In we go!

Now, hats, Coats, galoshes over here.
Hurry, we have so much time and so little to see.
Wait a minute! Strike that.
Reverse it. Thank you.
VIOLET: When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your Coat, Violet.
MIKE:
Boy, what Weird Coat hangers!
[SHRIEKING]
Surprises around every corner, but nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.
As soon as your outer vestments are in hand... we'll begin.
Now... will the children kindly step up here?
[MR. SALT MUMBLING]
MIKE:
Accidents? What kind of accidents?
MRS. TEEVEE:
I didn't know we had to sign anything.
MIKE: I can't read the bottom.
Violet, you first.
Sign here.
MR. BEAUREGARDE: Hold it!
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.
What's this all about?
Standard form of contract.
Don't talk contracts. I use them myself. They're for suckers.
You wouldn't begrudge me a little protection? A drop?
I don't sign anything.
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.
I'm sorry. House rules.
- I'm going! Don't you dare stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.
Nicely handled! She's a girl who knows where she's going. Violet.
What's all that small print?
Any problems? Dial information.
Thanks for Calling.
- Mike, Augustus.
- Violet! Violet!
I assume there's an accident indemnity clause?
Never between friends.
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed his wife's insurance policy.
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.
What about me, Grandpa?
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.
VERUCA: Let's go in! Come on!
Paüence, paüence!
Everything has to be in order.
Everyone signed? Yes?
Good. On we go!
Ninety-nine... forty-four... one hundred percent pure.
Just through the other door, please.
There's some mistake here.
MIKE: There is no other door.
There's no way out!
I know there's a door here someplace.
MR. BEAUREGARDE:
I don't like this, Wonka!
MR. SALT: Is this a trick?
Mr. Wonka, help!
I'm getting squashed! Save me!
Is it my soul that calls me by name?
Let me out or I'll scream!
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!
Question time will come at the end of the session. We must press on.
Come along. Come along.
- Ah, here we are.
MR. BEAUREGARDE: Don't be a fool.
That's the way we came in.
It is? Are you sure?
We've just come through there.
How do you like that?
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka? A fun house?
Why? Having fun?
I've had enough.
I'm not going in there.
We're getting out of here.
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.
Better press on.
MIKE: The room is getting smaller.
MRS. TEEVEE: No, it's not!
- He's getting bigger.
MR. SALT: He's at it again.
VIOLET: Where's the chocolate?
MR. BEAUREGARDE: L doubt if there is any.
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.
You can't squeeze me through that door.
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.
My dear friends... you are now about to enter the nerve center... to the entire Wonka factory.
Inside this room, all of my dreams become realities.
And some of my realities become dreams.
And almost everything you'll see is eatable... Edible.
I mean, you can eat almost everything.
Let me in, I'm Starving!
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.
We don't want anyone to lose that.
Yet.
Now, the combination.
This is a musical lock.

What a disgusting, dirty river!
What a disgusting, dirty river!
It's industrial waste.
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.
It's chocolate.
That's chocolate?
That's chocolate.
A chocolate river!
JOE: The most fantastic thing
I've ever seen.
WONKA: 10,000 gallons an hour.
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.
WONKA: It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.
No other factory in the world mixes chocolate by waterfall.
But it's the only way if you want it just right.
Grandpa, look there, across the river!
CHARLIE: Little men!
JOE:
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!
Now we know who makes it.
MR. SALT: I never saw anybody with an orange face before.
Funny-looking people.
MRS. TEEVEE:
What are they doing?
WONKA:
It's creaming and sugaring time.
VIOLET: They can't be real people.
WONKA: Of course they're real people.
Nonsense!
- No, Oompa Loompas.
ALL: Oompa Loompas?
From Loompaland.
Loompaland?
There's no such place!
Excuse me, dear lady...
I teach geography-
Then you know all about it.
And what a terrible country it is.
Nothing but desolate wastes and fierce beasts.
The poor little Oompa Loompas were so small and helpless... they would get gobbled up.
A Wangdoodle would eat 10 of them for breakfast and think nothing of it.
And so I said:
"Come and live with me in peace and safety..." away from all the Wangdoodles and Hornswogglers...
"...and Snozzwangers and rotten Vermicious Knids."
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?
I'm sorry, questions must be submitted in writing.
So, in the greatest of secrecy...
I transported the entire population of Oompa Loompas here.
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!
All right, I'll get you one before the day's out.
I want an Oompa Loompa now!
Can it, you nit!
AUGUSTUS: Mm. This is terrific.
CHARLIE: Grandpa, look at Augustus.
JOE: Don't worry, he can't drink it all.
CHARLIE: Grandpa, look at Augustus.
JOE: Don't worry, he can't drink it all.
Augustus, sweetheart, save some room for later.
Don't do that! My chocolate must never be touched by human hands.
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!
- Please, I beg you! Augustus!
- Aah!
WONKA: My chocolate!
Help!
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!
Don't just stand there!
Do something!
Help. Police. Murder.
- Quick, Charlie, here.
- Grab this!
MRS. TEEVEE:
What's happening to him?
MR. SALT: He's drowning.
MRS. GLOOP: Dive in!
- Save him!
- Oh, it's too late.
- Too late?
- He's had it now.
WONKA: The suction's got him.
MRS. GLOOP: Augustus, come back!
Where is he?
Watch the pipe.
VERUCA:
How long is he going to stay down?
MRS. GLOOP: He can't swim!
WONKA: No better time to learn.
VIOLET: His coat's going up the pipe!
MR. BEAUREGARDE: Call a plumber!
MR. SALT:
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?
It's his stomach.
Help! Help!
VIOLET: He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.
MR. SALT: How long will it take to push him through?
The suspense is terrible.
I hope it'll last.
CHARLIE: He'll never get out.
Yes, he will.
Remember, you once asked me how a bullet comes out of a gun?
He'll be made into marshmallows in five seconds!
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?
It doesn't go to the Marshmallow
Room, it goes to the Fudge Room.
MRS. GLOOP: You terrible man!

Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room, but look sharp... or her boy will go in the boiler.

That's quite a nice little canoe.
"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by."
All aboard!
Ladies first. That means Veruca.
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.
She's très jo/ie, but is she seaworthy?
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.
- You took good care of the August kid.
- Everybody aboard!
You're going to love this.
Just love it.
I want a boat like this. A beautiful paddleboat, that's what I want.
What she wants is a kick in the pants.
I'm gonna be seasick.
WONKA: Try one of these.
- What are they?
WONKA: Rainbow drops.
You can spit in seven colors.
Spitting's a dirty habit.
I know a Worse one.
- What business you in, Salt?
- Nuts.
Where are we going?
I don't like that tunnel.
I want off!
Around the world and home again.

You can't possibly see where you're going!
You're right. I can't.

This would make a great series!
MR. SALT: Wonka.
- This is kind of strange.
Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun! Ha-ha!
MIKE: This is terrific.
- I want to get off the boat, Wonka!
Aah! I may get sick!
This has gone too far!

You can suck them forever.
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!
- Me too!
- And me!
Fantastic invention.
Revolutionize the industry.
You suck them and they'll never get smaller. Never.
I think.
WONKA: Few more tests.
- How do you make them?
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.
Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
"Vlel 'l do!"
I can only give them to you if you swear to keep them for yourselves.
And never show them to another soul as long as you live.

- Bull!
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.
If it's gum, that's for me.
Violet, don't do anything stupid.
What's it taste like?
Madness! It's tomato soup!
It's creamy. I can feel it running down my throat!
Stop. Don't.

An omelette fit for a king, sir.
VERUCA: Are they chocolate eggs?
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.
But don't get too close.
The geese are temperamental, so we have the Eggdicator.
MRS. TEEVEE: Eggdi-what?
WONKA: The Eggdicator tells the difference between a good egg... and a bad egg.
If it's good, it's shined and shipped over the world.
If it's a bad egg... down the chute.
[HORN HONKS]
An educated Eggdicator.
It's a lot of nonsense.
<i>[SINGING]
A little nonsense now and then</i>
<i>ls relished by the wisest men.</i>
VERUCA: I want a golden goose!
Here we go again.
MR. SALT: All right, sweetheart.
You'll get one as soon as we get home.
No, I want one of those!
How much do you want for the goose?
WONKA: Not for sale.
- Name your price.
WONKA: She can't have one.
Who says I can't?
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!
I want a golden goose!
Gooses!
Geeses!
I want my geese to lay gold eggs for Easter.
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.
- Anything you say.
- And by the way...
I want a feast.
You ate before you came.
[SINGING] <i>I</i> want a bean-feast.
Oh, one of those.
<i>Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts.</i>
- So <i>good</i> you <i>could go</i> nuts.
- You'll have them when you get home.
No, now! I want a ball!
<i>[SINGING] I want</i> a <i>party.</i>
<i>Pink macaroons
And</i> a <i>million balloons.</i>
<i>And performing baboons and...</i>
<i>Give it to me.</i>
NOW!
<i>I want the world.</i>
<i>I want the whole world.</i>
<i>I want to /ock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate.</i>
<i>Give it to me now.</i>
<i>I want today.</i>
<i>I want tomorrow.</i>
<i>I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair.</i>
<i>And I don't want to share them.</i>
<i>I want</i> a <i>party
With roomfuls of laughter</i>
<i>10,000 tons of ice cream.</i>
<i>And if I don't
Get the things I am after.</i>
<i>I'm going to Scream!</i>
<i>I want the works.</i>
<i>I want the whole works.</i>
<i>Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises.</i>
<i>Of all shapes and sizes And now.</i>
<i>Don't care how I want it now.</i>
<i>Don't care how I want it now</i>
[HORN HONKS]
She was a bad egg.
Where's she gone?
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.
The garbage chute.
Where does it lead to?
To the furnace.
The furnace?
[LAUGHING]
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.
- She could be stuck inside the tube.
- Inside the...
Hold on!
Veruca! Sweetheart!
Daddy's coming!
[HORN HONKS]
There'll be a lot of garbage today.
There'll be a lot of garbage today.
Ah, Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.
Mr. Wonka, they won't really be burned in the furnace, will they?
Hm. I think that furnace is lit only every other day.
So they have a good sporting Chance.

The children are disappearing like rabbits!
The children are disappearing like rabbits!
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?
Can't we sit down for a minute?
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.
[GOOSE SQUAWKS]
WONKA: Behold the Wonkamobile!
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.
Grab a seat, they're going fast!
What's that they're filling it up with?
Ginger ale, ginger pop, ginger beer, beer bubbles... bubble cola, double cola, double-bubble burp-a-cola... all that carbonated stuff that tickles your nose.
Few people realize the power in one of those things.
I'm sorry I asked.
Would Slugworth pay extra to know about this?
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
Everybody set?
Will it go fast?
It should. It's got more gas than a politician!
Hold on. I'm gonna really open her up and see what she can do.

CHARLIE: Grandpa!
'Aahl - Ohi.
MIKE: It's getting in my eyes!
MRS. TEEVEE:
It's even in my shoes!
I'm soaked!
It'll never come out!
MIKE: It's sticking to my gun!
MRS. TEEVEE: Oh!
[SINGING IN SPANISH]
My dress! My hair! My face!
I'm sending you the Cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!
I'm dry-cleaned!
CHARLIE: Hey, Grandpa!
What was that we just went through?
What was that we just went through?
Hsaw Aknow.
- Is that Japanese?
- It's "Wonka Wash" spelled backwards.
That's it. The journey's over.
JOE:
Finest bath I've had in 20 years!
Let's do it again!
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?
If the Lord meant us to walk, he wouldn't have invented roller skates.
Would you put these on?
We have to be careful.
There's dangerous stuff inside.
Wonkavision!
My very latest and greatest invention.
MIKE: It's television!
WONKA: It's Wonkavision.
You all know how ordinary television works.
- You photo...
- You photograph something... then it's split into millions of pieces... that fly through the air down to your TV set in the right order.
You should open your mouth a little wider when you speak.
If they can do it with a photograph... why can't I do it with a bar of chocolate?
I shall now send this chocolate bar from one end of the room to the other.
It has to be big, because when you transmit by television... it always ends up smaller.
Goggles on, please.
Lights, camera...
.uacüonl
[MRS. TEEVEE SCREAMS]
You can remove your goggles.
Where's the chocolate?
It's flying over our heads in a million pieces.
Now watch the screen.
[BEEPING]
Here it comes.
There it is.
Take it.
How? It's just a picture.
All right, you take it.
It's real!
Taste it! It's delicious.
It's just gotten smaller.
It's perfect!
Unbelievable!
- A miracle!
- It's a TV dinner!
- It's Wonkavision.
- It could change the world!
Can you send other things?
- Notjust chocolate, I mean.
- Anything you like.
What about people?
People?
Hm. I don't really know.
I suppose I could.
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.
But it might have messy results.
MIKE: I'm gonna be the first person to be sent by television!
MRS. TEEVEE: Get away!
Stop. Don't. Come back.
MIKE: Lights, camera, action!
Mike! Where are you?
He's up there, in a million pieces.
Mike, are you there?
No good shouting, dear.
Watch the screen.
Mike? Why is he taking so long?
A million pieces take time to put together.
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...
- Oh!
- Our group's getting smaller by the minute!
MIKE: Look at me! I'm the first person in the world to be sent by television!
Wow, what a wild trip that was!
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened!
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?
Great. He's completely unharmed.
You call that unharmed?!
Wow, that was something.
Can I do it again?
MRS. TEEVEE: No, there'll be nothing left!
- Don't worry, Mom. I feel fine.
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!
Wait till the kids back home hear!
Nobody's gonna hear!
Where are you taking me?
I don't want to go in there!
Be quiet!
Well?
Fortunately, small boys are extremely springy and elastic.
So I think we'll put him in my special taffy-pulling machine.
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.
The boy's in his mother's purse.
But be careful.
Taffy pull...?
What's he saying?
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
No, I won't hold you responsible.
Oh. And now, my dearest lady, it's time to say goodbye.
_Ah__ - No, no! Don't Speak!
For some moments in life, there are no words. Run along, now.

So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.
I must answer that note from the queen.
What will happen to the others?
Augustus? Veruca?
My dear boy... they'll be quite all right.
When they leave they'll be restored to their normal, terrible old selves.
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.
Don't worry.
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?
Oh, yes. Well, I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.
Straight up the stairs. I'm terribly busy.
A whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both. Goodbye.
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?
I don't know, Charlie.
But I'm gonna find out.
- Mr. Wonka?
- I am extraordinarily busy, sir.
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.
When does he get it?
- He doesn't.
- Why not?
Because he broke the rules.
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?
Wrong, sir! Wrong!
Under Section 37-B of the contract signed by him... it states clearly that all offers shall become null and void if... and you can read it for yourself in this copy:
"I, the undersigned..." shall forfeit all rights, privileges and licenses...
"...herein contained," et cetera...
[SPEAKING IN LATIN]
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as Crystal!
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!
You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be sterilized!
So you get nothing!
You lose!
Good day, sir!
You're a crook.
A cheat and a swindler, that's what you are!
How can you do this?!
Build up a little boy's hopes and then smash his dreams to pieces!
You're an inhuman monster!
I said, good day!
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.
I'll get even if it's the last thing I do.
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper, he'll get one.
Mr. Wonka?
WONKA: "So shines a good deed..." in a weary world."
Charlie.
My boy.
You won!
You did it! You did it!
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!
Oh, Charlie, forgive me for putting you through this. Please.
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.
- Pleasure.
- Slugworthl.
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!
- Foryou?
- I had to test you, Charlie.
And you passed the test.
You won!
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?
The chocolate, yes.
But that's just the beginning!
We have so much time and so little to do!
Strike that. Reverse it.
This way, please!
We'll take the Wonkavator.
We'll take the Wonkavator.
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.
A Won kavator.
An elevator goes up and down.
But the Wonkavator can go sideways, slantways, backways...
CHARLIE: And frontways?
And any ways you can think of.
It'll take you to any room by pressing one of these buttons. Any button.
Press a button, and zing!
You're off.
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.
Except one.
This one.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Me?
There it goes!
[WHIRRING]
Hold on tight.
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.
Faster! If we don't pick up speed, we won't get through.
- Through what?
- Aha.
- You mean, we're going...?
- Up and out.
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1000 pieces!
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.
Hold on, everybody!
Here it comes!
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.
Grandpa, our town looks so pretty.
JOE: Look over here, Charlie.
I think I see our house.
CHARLIE: Wow!
JOE: Lt really looks beautiful.
There's my school!
How did you like the chocolate factory?
It's the most wonderful place in the world.
WONKA:
I'm pleased to hear you say that... because I'm giving it to you.
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?
JOE: You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.
And I don't really want to try.
Who can I trust to run the factory, take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?
Not a grownup.
A grownup would do everything his own way, nof mine.
That's why I decided long ago that I had to find a child.
A very honest... loving child... to whom I can tell all my precious Candy-making secrets.
- That's why you sent the tickets.
WONKA: That's right.
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.
And me? WONKA: Absolutely.
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.
I want you to bring them all.
But Charlie... don't forget what happened to the man who got everything he wanted.
What happened?
He lived happily ever after.
