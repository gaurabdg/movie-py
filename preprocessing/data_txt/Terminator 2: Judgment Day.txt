This next patient is interesting.
I've been following the case for years.
A 29-year-old female, diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
The usual indicators: depression, anxiety, violent acting out, delusions of persecution.
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.
She believes that a machine called the Terminator, which looked human, of course, was sent back through time to kill her.
That's original.
And also, that the father of her child was a soldier sent back to protect her.
- No?
- He was from the future too.
The year 2029, if I remember correctly.

<b><font color="#804000">WOMAN:</font></b> Break it up before I wring both of your necks.
I need to know how Skynet gets built, who's responsible.
The man most directly responsible is 
Miles Bennett Dyson.
<b><font color="#804000">JOHN:</font></b> Who is that?
He's the director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,
Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.
All Stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned.
Afterwards, they fly with a perfect operational record.
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.
Human decisions are removed from strategic defence.
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.
It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am
Eastern time, August 29.
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?
Because Skynet knows that the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.
Jesus!
How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
Want to know everything.
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.
Miles!
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.
This thing is kicking my ass.
It's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I can't. 
I'm on a roll.
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.
I know. You told me.
It thinks and learns like we do.
It's superconducting at room temperature.
Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.
Why is that so important?
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy here.
Baby, I am this close.
Come here.
Imagine a jet airliner with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes, never shows up with a hangover.
Meet the pilot.
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.
Your heart and your mind are in here.
But it doesn't love you like we do.
I'm sorry. Really.
How about spending some time with your other babies?

- Yeah!

<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>
<i>Nothing much happened.</i>
<i>Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>
<i>There was no Judgment Day.</i>
<i>People went to work as they always do.</i>
<i>Laughed, complained,</i>
<i>watched TV, made love.</i>
<i>I wanted to run through the street yelling</i>
<i>to grab them all and say,</i>
<i>Every day from this day on is a gift.</i>
<i>Use if well.</i>
<i>Instead, I got drunk.</i>
<i>That was 30 years ago.</i>
But the dark future which never came still exists for me.
And it always will, like the traces of a dream.
John fights the war differently than it was foretold.
Here, on the battlefield of the Senate his weapons are common sense and hope.
Tie me, Grandma. 
Tie me!
How's that?
Thank you, Grandma.
<i>The luxury of hope</i>
<i>was given to me by the Terminator.</i>
<i>Because if a machine can learn the value of human life</i>
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
