Yeah.
- You see that guy?
- Yeah.
You know who that is?
It's not him.
It looks like him, but it's not him.
Can you believe it?
Okay, maybe it is.
He's here with us.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Shut up. Shut up.
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!
Sunset Odds. Loved it.
- Man, that car chase,
- I couldn't believe it.
Four buses ... and he took that thing and everything exploded.
- I heard he did his own driving.
- I don't know.
Did you do your own driving?
- I did.
- Cool.
So, what are you doing here?
Yeah.
Um ... seeing friends. 
Seeing friends.

Okay.
I love you. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.
Mr. Bob-san.
Suntory whisky.
Casablanca. Bogie.
Suntory time.
He want you to turn, look in camera.
Okay?
That's all he said?
Yes.
Turn to camera.
All right, does he want me to turn from the right, or turn from the left?
Passionate. Camera. Passion.
Right side and with intensity.
Okay?
Is that everything? I mean, it seemed like he said ... quite a bit more than that.
Whisky.
Gently.
Tension.
Like an old friend, and into the camera.
Okay.
Whisky.
It's Suntory time! Okay?
Okay.
Okay?
- Hey, come on!
- Come on, come on, come on.
For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.
Cut-o! Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!
Could you do it slower ... and with more intensity?
Suntory time.

Hello?
Lauren?
Charlotte! Hey!
Hey.
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?
It's great here.
It's really great. Um ...
I don't know ...
I went to this shrine today.
- Mmm-hmm?
- And ... there were these monks, and they were chanting.
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?
And I don't know ...
I even tried ikebana, and John is using these hair products.
I just ...
I don't know who I married.
Look, can you wait a second?
Just hold on. I'll be right back.
Okay, sure.
Sorry. What were you saying?
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?
Okay. Have the best time. Just call me when you get back. Okay? Bye.
- Bye.
- Love you.
God!
Ow.
At the fitting today, they had all these ... rock-and-roll clothes, but the band wasn't tough at all.
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll," but it's just so much better ... if they're just skinny and nerdy like they came in, you know.
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes, and it's just ridiculous.
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think? I mean ...
Yeah.
Yeah, that's exactly what I was saying.
But then you try to ...
I mean, you know ...
That's what I think.
Do you think this is done?
I don't know. I don't know.
Would you ... 
Would you please stop smoking?
I like to. I don't really smoke that much.
It's just so bad for you, though.
Well, I'll stop later.
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.
Yes, Mr. Harris.
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Harris?
- Yes?
- Mr. Kazu sent me.
- Oh?
May I enter?
Thank you.
Do you like massage?
I don't think
I like massage anymore.
Mr. Kazu sends premium fantasy.
My stockings, lip them.
Lip my stockings.
Yes, please.
Lip them.
What?
Lip them.
Hey! Lip my stocking!
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?
Lip them. Like this.
Lip them.
- Rip them?
- Lip, yes.
You want me to rip your stockings?
Yes, lip my stockings, please.
- Rip your stockings.
- Yes.
- You want me to rip your stockings.
- Please? Please? Please?
All right, I'm gonna rip your stockings, and you tell Mr. Kazu ... you know ... we had a blast.
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!
Don't touch me!
Mr. Bob Harris, don't touch me!
Just lip my stocking!

Hi! Mr. Harris, good morning.
Hi.
Hello. We just got a request from Tanabe Mori.
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.
It is a big honor to be invited to his show.
Can you stay here until Friday?
I'm surprised and honored, but I think I need to check with my agent.
- Okay.
- I believe I may have a previous commitment.
- Sure.
- Okay. I understand.
- Shall we go?
- Yes.
I think you should do it.
No, hear this, Fred.
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.
We're looking into it, Bob.
They really want you to stay and do that talk show.
Apparently, he's a really big deal ...
Johnny Carson of Japan. Yeah.
Bob, these people are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?
I already have. You know, 
I gotta get out of here.
As soon as I can.
All right, you're scheduled to leave Friday, but we'll hold it for you Saturday.
All right, now ...
You're breaking up, Fred. There's no reception in this studio.
Forget it. Call me back.
So, can you put your hand close your face, please?
I'm sorry, Naka. What?
Can you put your hand close your face? Close your face.
I don't get that close to the glass until I'm on the floor.
How's this?
Yes. You want a whisky?
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whisky ...
I need mysterious face.
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?
I need more mysterious and ...
More mysterious. Yeah.
I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whisky?"
You are a movie star, yes?
Yes, I should be doing movies, yes, but ...
And Lat Pack.
Lat Pack.
You know Lat Pack?
- Rat ... Rat Pack?
- Rat Pack. Yes, please.
Oh, Rat Pack.
I need more tension, please.

That's good. Yeah.
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great.
- Joey Bishop would you like?
- Yes. Just change film.
Are you drinking? No?
- Am I drinking?
- Yeah.
As soon as I'm done.
- Okay, close your hand, please.
- Huh?
- Close your hand. Yeah.
- Close it?
Yes. Close your face, please.
- Close my ... 
- Yes. Sorry.
And 007?
He drinks martinis, but okay, 
I got it.
007, yeah.
Loger Moore?
- Loger Moore? 
- Loger Moore.
You know Loger Moore?
- Roger Moore?
- Yeah.
Okay. I ...
I always think of Sean Connery.
Seriously.
No, no.
Didn't you get the Sean Connery one over here?
- No. Loger Moore.
- Okay.
Yes.

Evelyn Waugh?
- What?
- Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Oh, come on. She's nice.
What? You know ... you know, not everybody went to Yale.
It was just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake.
Why do you have to defend her?
Well, why do you have to point out how stupid everybody is all the time?
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.
Well ...
- Hey, John, we gotta go.
- Oh. Yeah.
Bye.
Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is?
This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny.
Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear.
The Inner Map Theory is an example ... of how each soul begins with an imprint, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul ... before you've even gotten here.
You know, I guess the reason why
I like Japan the best ... out of all Asian countries, is because I really feel close to Buddhism.
I really feel ...
I really believe in reincarnation.
That's part of what drew me to Midnight Velocity as well, because although Keanu dies, he eventually gets reincarnated.
So there's hope. There's hope in reincarnation, I think.
What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?
He was always so ... He was always, you know, giving me ideas, and, you know, really helpful.
He made me feel really comfortable, so ...
And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A., so we have all these different things in common.
So, you know, we both really like Mexican food, and yoga and ... karate!
Mexican food. Yoga.
Konnichiwa.
- Hello. 
- Hi.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
He got married a couple of times ... to some nice women.
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and 
I would be crazy for these women.
But there were always rumors.
I never liked his acting, so I never gave a damn whether he was straight or not.
Thank you. Hi. Thanks.
What can I get you?
I'm not sure.
For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.
I'll have a vodka tonic.
Thanks.
So, what are you doing here?
A couple of things.
Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday ... and getting paid $2 million ... to endorse a whisky ... when I could be doing a play somewhere.
Oh.
But the good news is, the whisky works.
What are you doing?
My husband's a photographer, so he's here working, and I wasn't doing anything, so I came along.
And we have some friends that live here.
How long have you been married?
Thank you.
Two years.
Twenty-five long ones.
You're probably just having a midlife crisis.
Did you buy a Porsche yet?
You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche.
Twenty-five years. That's a ...
Well, it's impressive.
Well, you figure you sleep one-third of your life.
That knocks off eight years of marriage right there.
So you're down to 16 and change.
You're just a teenager at marriage.
You can drive it, but there's still the occasional accident.
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm not sure yet, actually.
I just graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket.
Yeah.
Well, so far it's pro bono.
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles.
Yeah.
I hope your Porsche works out.
Cheers to that, huh?
Cheers to that.
Wish I could sleep.

She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.
Oh, you wanna come?
Yeah, sure.
Okay. Yeah.

Everybody is always like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic."
And I'm like, "No, I'm not."
I eat so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it.
Just because I have a high metabolism.
Because I thought you were anorexic too.
Everybody does.
Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, 'cause you look so ...
Thank you. I know, but it's ...
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.
- Yeah.
- But ...
My dad is an anorexic.
- Really?
- Oh, really?
Yeah.
He fought on the American side of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.
He was taken prisoner, and the whole time he was there they tortured him about food.
Every day they told him they put poison in the food.
So they would always make themselves throw up after every meal.
That's horrible. That's terrible.
That's some crazy shit.
- You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
- No.
You know that break beat, right?
Well, I been taking it to some next level shit.
Like, I'll take that and put a delay on it, so it's like ...
So it's, like, evolving the beat.
So it, like, sounds hella large on the track. You know what I'm saying?
- No.
- No?
You don't listen to hip-hop?
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.
Okay, promise me you'll try it.
Will you try this power cleanse?
- I did it last week, and it's amazing. 
- I'll be right back.
It's so good to get the toxins out of your body, you know.
With all, like, the pollution, all, like, the ...

- Hello.
You ever switch seats?
I like this one. If I fall, someone will notice.
Yeah.
So, you having a nice time?
Can you keep a secret?
I'm trying to organize a prison break.
I'm looking for, like, an accomplice.
We'd have to, first, get out of this bar.
Then the hotel, then the city and then the country.
Are you in, or are you out?
I'm in.
Good. I'll go pack my stuff.
Get your coat.
See you.
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.
Oh, look. The label got me these.
I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?
Well, I'm ... I gotta go.
I mean, I ...
You know, you don't have to stay.
I mean ...
You don't have to go, do you?
Well, I ...
I know. You're gonna be working the whole time.
I'll have a much better time here.
I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Yeah! Call those guys.
And I'm gonna be back on Sunday, and I ...
I love you, you know.
Okay? I love you.
I'll see you. Okay?
Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple of ... a couple of days.
Bye.
I love you.
Hello.
- Hello. 
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?
It's a cool pool, isn't it?
Yeah, it's nice.
Get any sleep?
Not yet. How about you?
No. Not yet.
How long you staying for?
I'll be in the bar for the rest of the week.
Well, that's good.
I'm going out with some friends later, if you wanna come ...
Sure.
Okay. I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- See you.
Which one is burgundy?
Hold on!
Hold on.
You really are having a midlife crisis, huh?
Really? Yeah, I was afraid of that.
I kept telling myself that I just wanted to be ready in case we go to war tonight.
My bathroom is messier than yours.
And it's not like you're not trying.
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?
Sure.

~ Hello? ~
Hey.
~ Hello, Bob. ~
Hey, you know, those carpet samples, you were right about the burgundy.
It wasn't even close.
Blows the others away.
~ I'm glad you like it. ~
I saw a great house tonight that you would've loved, and that burgundy would've been good in this house, really.
~ Really? ~
A guy designed his own house and built it.
~ Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it. ~ 
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.
And there were 
Japanese surfers there, and the guy was playing really, really, really great music.
I should've found out what it was and brought some ...
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.
~ That sounds great.
Can you hold on? ~
~ You have to have something for breakfast. Do you want some cereal? ~ 
Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.
~ I'm just trying to get her to eat something. ~
Yeah. Tell her I said she has to eat something.
~ Your dad says eat something.
- No. ~ 
Eat. Tell her I said so.
~ She won't eat anything.
Forget it. ~
~ Look, I'm glad you're having fun. ~
It's not fun. It's just ...
It's just very, very different.
~ Maybe that's good. ~
~ I have to get the kids off for school, okay? ~
~ So, can I call you in a while? ~
I might not be up.
It's ... it's, like, 4:00.
~ Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning. ~
No, actually, they gave me tomorrow off.
~ That must be nice. ~
~ All right. Well, thanks for checking in. I gotta go. ~
- All right. Have a great, great night.
~ All right. ~
I mean, I guess have a great morning, huh?
~ Good night, Bob. Good night. ~
Good night.
I love you.
That was a stupid idea.
- I was feeling tight, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Shoulders and neck.
- Mmm-hmm.
So I called down and had a ... shiatsu massage in my room.
That's nice.
And the tightness has completely disappeared ... and been replaced by ... unbelievable pain.
Just staggering, unbearable pain.
That's too bad.
- Yeah. 
- I'm in pain.
I got my foot banged up, and ...
Wanna see it?
How do you say "No"?
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know.
That's ...
How ... when did you do this?
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?
Didn't you feel any pain? Your ...
Yeah, it really hurt.
It was ...
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.
I think I gotta take you to a doctor.
You can't just put that back in the shoe.
No. I don't think so.
Well, you either go to a doctor, or you leave it here.
He's smiling.
You like that idea?
See, they love black toe over in this country.
You got a sharp knife?
Gotta be, you know, in this country, somebody's gotta prefer a black toe.
"Brack toe."
Or we should probably hang around until someone orders it.
Hey, what's with the straight face?
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.
- All right. Thank you.
- All right.
Careful, okay? No, don't!
- No!
- Hey, use the horn, fella.
Let's try "Mixed Internal".
Yeah. Go.
Switched to beer, huh?
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.
Stop.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. We need a doctor.
For a hurt ... Emergency room.
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?
Which number?
We're not going to another hospital, so whatever you say is okay.
Okay.
Could you put that back in the garage for us?
"In desuka"?
Japan.
Japan ...
After?
Japan ...
Ahh-ah, so. Ahh-ah.
Ahh, so. Ahh ...
How's that song go?
Is that for me?
Yeah, it can be for you.
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.
I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called Orange around 10:00, so I'll fax you a map on how to get there.
I hope you can come and meet us. Bye.

~ No, no. Not here. ~
~ It must be over there. ~
You know, the first time I saw you, you were wearing a tuxedo at the bar.
You were very dashing.
I liked the mascara.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
You don't remember?
I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?
Did I scowl at you?
No, you smiled.
I did?
Yes, it was a complete accident.
A freak. I haven't seen it since.
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.
Bigger. Yeah, big, big ...
Well, not that big.
~ My goodness. ~
~ Marcello, come here. Hurry up. ~
Why do they switch the "R's" and the "L's" here?
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.
They have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.
Whatever you say. You're the boss.
I'm stuck.
Does it get easier?
No.
Yes.
It gets easier.
Oh, yeah?
Look at you.
Thanks.
The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let ... things upset you.
Yeah.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.
You know?
I tried being a writer, but ...
I hate what I write.
And I tried taking pictures, but they're so mediocre, you know.
Every girl goes through a photography phase.
You know, like horses?
You know? 
Take dumb pictures of your feet.
You'll figure that out.
I'm not worried about you.
Keep writing.
But I'm so mean.
- Mean's okay.
- Yeah?
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?
That's hard.
We used to have a lot of fun.
Lydia would come with me when I made the movies, and we would laugh about it all.
Now she doesn't want to leave the kids, and she doesn't ... need me to be there.
The kids miss me, but they're fine.
It gets a whole lot more complicated when you have kids.
Yeah. It's scary.
It's the most terrifying day of your life ... the day the first one is born.
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.
Your life, as you know it, is gone.
Never to return.
But they learn how to walk, and they learn how to talk, and ...
And you want to be with them.
And they turn out to be the most ... delightful people ... you will ever meet in your life.
Hmm, that's nice.
Where'd you grow up?
I grew up in New York, and I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married.
But it's so different there.
Yeah, I know.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You're not hopeless.
Hello?
~ Mr. Harris? ~
- Yes.
~ A fax for you. ~
Okay. Can you send it up?
Do you think you could kick it under the door for me, slide it under the door for me, please?
~ Do you want I send it to your room? ~
Just slide it under the door, please. Thank you.
~ Thank you, Mr. Harris. ~
- Okay. All right, bye.
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki. 
It's Bob Harris.
Yes, I would love to do his talk show.
I would.
I would love to change my plans and stay.
... American movie star ...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Harris!
Come on! 
Da de da de, da de da dah.
Da de da dah! Whoo!
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!
Nice to meet you.
He said you guys are e-mailing together.
He wants to show you his dance.
Japanese dance step.
Japanese dance.
Do I ... Do I have to dance with him?
To-tung a-tung.
To-tung a-tung.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby ... Bobby.
- Welcome, Bob.
- What?
He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."
- Hello?
~ Bob? ~
Hi, Lydia.
~ Is this a bad time? ~
No, it's always a good time.
~ Look, your burgundy carpet isn't in stock. ~
~ It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did you like any of the other colors? ~
Whatever you like.
I'm completely lost.
~ It's just carpet. ~
That's not what I'm talking about.
~ What are you talking about? ~
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.
You know, I want to take better care of myself.
I would like to start eating healthier.
I don't want all that pasta.
~ What? ~
I would like to start eating, like, Japanese food.
~ Well, why don't you just stay there, and you can have it every day? ~
How are the kids doing?
~ They're fine.
They miss their father. ~
~ But they're getting used to you not being here. ~
~ Do I need to worry about you, Bob? ~
Only if you want to.
~ Bob, I got things to do.
I gotta go. ~
Okay.
~ I'll see you ... I mean,
I'll talk to you later. ~
Okay.
~ Okay, bye. ~
Bye.
We have Matthew Smellick!
Matthew Snellick.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We'll take a really short break, and we'll see you in a minute.

Hello?
~ It's Lydia, your wife. ~
Oh, I'm ... I couldn't hear you.
~ Do you want to talk to Zoe? ~
Yeah.
~ Zoe, come say hello to your father. ~
~ No. ~
~ She just ran into the other room. ~
It's okay. It's okay.
~ Okay. Her ballet recital is Sunday. Don't forget. ~
I didn't forget.
~ Well, travel safely.
I'll see you soon. ~
~ Mommy! ~
Okay.
~ Okay. Bye. ~
Bye.
Well, she is closer to your age.
You could talk about things you have in common, like ... growing up in the '50s.
Maybe she liked the movies you were making in the '70s, when you still were making movies.
Wasn't there anyone else there to lavish you with attention?
I'm switching to beer. Okay?
I can't tell the difference.
We'll have two of these, okay?

Good night.
Good night. Okay.
Good night.
Okay.
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.
Good morning, Mr. Harris.
Have a nice flight.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
I'll be one minute.
Charlotte, I'm down in the lobby, and I'm leaving now.
I was calling ... to see if you still have my jacket.
If you could bring it down, but you're not there, so this is goodbye, and ...
So,
I guess, goodbye and enjoy my jacket which you stole ... from me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
How are you?
- I'm good.
- How are you?
Mr. Harris, thank you for coming.
- Enjoy your trip?
- I had a great time.
I had a very good time.
- Excuse me. Aren't you Bob Harris?
- Yes, I am.
- I'm such a big fan. So nice to meet you.
- Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.
What are you doing here in Japan?
I have to go right now.
- Excuse me one second.
- Okay. Well ...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thought I'd missed you.
Are you going right now?
Yeah. 
And my bodyguards are right here.
All right. 
Aren't you gonna wish me ...
"Have a good fright" or something?
Yeah, right.
Okay. Well, bye.
All right.
Can I take one more picture?
Sure.
Hey, hold on here.
Let me out. Thank you.
Hey, you.
