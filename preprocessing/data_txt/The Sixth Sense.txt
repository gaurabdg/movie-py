How much...
[Grunts]
Does a fine frame like that cost, do you think?
I never told you, but you sound a little like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.
I know.
I'm serious.
Serious, I am.
I'd say it cost at least a couple hundred.
<i>- I'm gonna read it for you.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?</i>

"for countless children and their families,

Wow.

This is an important night for us.
Finally, someone is recognizing the sacrifices you've made... that you have put everything second, including me, for those families that they're talking about.
They're also saying that my husband has a gift.
You have a gift that teaches children...

You know, in the olden days in Europe, people used to hide out in churches.
They would claim sanctuary.
What were they hiding from?
Bad people, mostly.
People that wanted to put them in jail, hurt them.
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.
They're my dad's.
The lenses hurt my eyes.
What were you talking about with your soldiers when I came in? Day...
<i>De profundus clamo adite domine.</i>
It's called "Latin."
All your soldiers speak Latin?
No.
Just one.
Are you a good doctor?

I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in the morning,
I quit my jobs,
<i>and I ate a big picnic in the park with lots of chocolate mousse pie.</i>
<i>And then I swam in the fountain all afternoon.</i>
<i>What'd you do?</i>
I was picked first for kick ball teams at recess.
I hit a grand slam to win the game.
<i>Everybody lifted me up on their shoulders and carried me around, cheering.</i>
Well, in that case, I am gonna make you some triangle pancakes.
You got an hour.
<i>[Malcolm] Hi.</i>
Wanna sit?
<i>Don't feel like talking today?</i>
Wanna play a game?
<i>It's a mind-reading game.</i>
Here's how it works.
I read your mind.

<i>Wanna play?</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
When your mother and father were first divorced, your mom went to see a doctor like me, and he didn't help her.
<i>So you think I'm not going to be able to help you.</i>
You're worried that she said she told him things... things she couldn't tell anyone else.
Secrets.
You have a secret, but you don't want to tell me.
Your dad gave you that watch as a present just before he went away.
He forgot it in a drawer.
Doesn't work.
You keep pretty quiet in school, but... you're a good student, you've never really been in any serious trouble.
<i>We were supposed to draw a picture.</i>
Anything we wanted.
I drew a man.
He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
You saw that on TV, Cole?
<i>[Footsteps]</i>
Everyone got upset.
They had a meeting.
Mom started crying.
<i>I don't draw like that anymore.</i>
How do you draw now?
I draw... people smiling, dogs running, rainbows.
They don't have meetings about rainbows.
No. I guess they don't.
What am I thinking now?
I don't know what you're thinking now.
<i>I was thinking...</i> you're nice, but you can't help me.
[Sighs]
I thought you meant the other Italian restaurant I asked you to marry me in.
[Sighs]
I'm so sorry, Anna.
I just can't seem to keep track of time.
And I didn't have a very good session today.
They're both so similar.
The same mannerisms, same expressions, same things hanging over their head.
I think it might be some kind of abuse.
Cole has... scratches on his arm.
I think they might be fingernail cuts.
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him, and it doesn't seem to fit.
Or I could just be wrong.
Maybe he's just a kid who likes to climb trees a lot.
<i>[Sighs]
Anna.</i>
I know that I've been a little distant, all right?
I know that it makes you mad.
I just... feel like I'm being given a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.
[Sighs]
Anna.
Happy anniversary.
[Sighs]
<i>[Cole] Stop looking at me.</i>
I don't like when people look at me like that.
[Malcolm] Okay.
[Children Chattering]
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Is he your best buddy?
He hates me.
Do you hate him?
No.
Did your mom set that up?
Yes.
Did you ever talk to your mom about how things are with Tommy?
I don't tell her things.
Why not?
'Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody else, and I don't want her to.
I don't want her to know.
Know what?
That I'm a freak.
Hey.
You are not a freak.
Okay?
Don't you believe anybody that tries to convince you of that. That's bullshit.
You don't have to go through your life believing that.
Okay?
Come on.
You said the "S" word.
Yeah, I know.
Sorry.

<i>[Malcolm] So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady...</i>
<i>that works in a toll booth?</i>
<i>[Cole] I wonder if she has to pee when she's working.</i>
<i>Think she just holds it?</i>
I don't know. I was just thinking about that myself.
You asked a lot of questions about Dad today.
<i>How come?</i>
Well, sometimes we do things to draw attention,
<i>to express our feelings about certain issues...</i> divorce, whatever.
For example, a person might leave something on the desk for someone else to find.
<i>Do you know what free association writing is, Cole?</i>
<i>[Cole] No.</i>
<i>[Malcolm] Free association writing is when you take a pencil in your hand,</i>
<i>and you put the pencil to a piece of paper and you start writing.</i>
<i>And you don't look at what you're writing or think about what you're writing.</i>
<i>You just keep your hand moving.</i>
<i>And after a while, if you keep your hand moving long enough,</i>
<i>words and thoughts start coming out that you didn't even know you had in you.</i>
<i>It could be something you heard somewhere else,</i>
<i>or feelings you had deep inside of you.</i>
<i>Have you ever done any free association writing, Cole?</i>
<i>[Cole] Yes.</i>
<i>[Malcolm] What did you write?</i>
Upset words.
<i>Did you ever write any upset words before your father left?</i>
I don't remember.
Can you do something for me?
I want you to think about what you wanna get out of our time together... what our goal should be.
Something I want?
If you could change something in your life, anything at all, what would it be?
Instead of something I want, can it be something I don't want?
Okay.
I don't want to be scared anymore.
<i>[Knocking On Door]</i>

<i>to the flea market in the Amish country.</i>
<i>I thought maybe you'd wanna come along...</i>
<i>and show me how to buy at one of these things.</i>
<i>I don't know if I can deal with the Amish today.</i>
<i>You can't curse or spit or anything around them.</i>
<i>I just figured maybe you'd just want to get out and get some air,</i>
<i>because you've seemed kind of down lately.</i>
<i>Um, I'm okay.</i>
<i>Do you think that maybe I should stop by on the way back, show you what I got?</i>
<i>Because that wouldn't be a problem.</i>
<i>No, I... You know,
I can see on Monday.</i>
<i>Sure, yeah, that's fine.
I'm just...</i>
<i>Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going then. I'll speak to you later.</i>
<i>- Don't step in the horse manure.
Thank you very much.</i>
<i>[Door Closes]</i>
Keep moving, cheese dick.
Can anybody guess what city was capital of the United States of America... from 1790 to 1800?
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.
[All Together] Philadelphia!
Right, right.
Philadelphia's one of the oldest cities in this country.
A lot of generations have lived here and died here.
<i>Almost anyplace you go in this city has a history and a story behind it.</i>
Even this school and the grounds it sits on.
Can anyone guess what this building was used for a hundred years ago... before you went to school here, before I went to this school even?
Yes, Cole.
They used to hang people here.
No, uh, that... Mm-mm. That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
They pulled the people in, crying and kissing their families bye.
People watching... spit at them.
Uh, Cole, this building was a legal courthouse.
Laws were passed here... some of the very first laws of this country.
This whole building was full of, uh, lawyers,
<i>- lawmakers.
They were the ones that hanged everybody.</i>
<i>[Children Whispering, Giggling]</i>
Uh...
I don't know which one of these guys told you that, but, uh, they were just trying to scare you.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Like what?
Stop it!
I, uh, I-I-I don't know how else to look.
You're Stuttering Stanley!
Excuse me?
You talked funny when you went to school here.
You talked funny all the way to high school.
<i>- What?
You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.</i>
<i>- How did you...
Stop looking at me!</i>
Who have you... [Stammering]
Been speaking to?

I don't wanna talk about anything right now.
<i>Okay.</i>
You like magic?
Hmm?
Observe:
The magic penny.
Looks like an ordinary penny.
But I do my little magic shake, and... now it's in my right hand.
But that's not the end of the magic trick.
I do another little shake, and... right there in the vest pocket.
But that's not the end of the magic trick.
I do another little shake... and... right back in the left hand where it started.
That isn't magic.
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.
<i>You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time.</i>
Think so?
I didn't know you were funny.
<i>## [Pop]</i>
<i>[Woman] Malcolm, sit your cute butt down and listen up.</i>
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.
<i>And you better make her happy.

<i>"Mmm, this taste like real butter kind of happy.</i>
I'm talkin' about...
What's up, girl?
"Julie Andrews twirling around like... a mental patient on a mountaintop" kind of happy.
<i>That's the kind of happy
I'm talkin about.</i>
<i>Shh. Come here.</i>
Don't tell her I told you, but she said she knew she love you... from the first time she met you on the street.

<i>I love you guys.</i>

<i>[Shower Water Running]</i>
<i>## [Rock]</i>

And then you do the magic shake.
The penny has moved from my pocket... all the way back to the hand it started in.
That's stupid.
It's supposed to be funny.
It's stupid.
I want my penny back.

You think I hurt my child?
You think I'm a bad mother?
Mrs. Sloan over there, she's a social worker with the hospital.
She's gonna ask you a couple procedural questions.
What happened to my child today?
<i>Something was happening to him, physically happening.
Something was very wrong!</i>
<i>Hey.</i>
Did your father used to tell you bedtime stories?
Once upon a time there was this young prince,
<i>and he decided that he wanted to go for a drive.</i>
<i>He got his driver, and they started driving.</i>
Driving, driving.
[Sighs]
Driving a lot.
And, uh, they drove so much that he fell asleep.
<i>And...</i>
Then he woke up, and he realized they were still driving.
<i>- This was a very long trip.
Dr. Crowe?</i>
You haven't told bedtime stories before.
Uh, not too many, no.
You have to add some twists and stuff.
Okay. Some twists.
<i>Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.</i>
<i>- Maybe they run out of gas.
They run out of gas?</i>
That's good, 'cause they're driving, right? Okay, so...
Tell me the story about why you're sad.
You think I'm sad?
What makes you think that?
Your eyes told me.
Not supposed to talk about stuff like that.
<i>Once upon a time, there was this person named Malcolm.</i>
He worked with children.
He loved it.
He loved it more than anything else.
And then one night, he found out that... he made a mistake with one of them.
<i>He couldn't help that one.</i>
<i>And he can't stop thinking about it.</i>
He can't forget.
Ever since then, things have been different.
<i>He's not the same person that he used to be.</i>
And his wife... doesn't like the person that he's become.
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.
<i>And then one day, Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy.</i>
<i>A really cool little boy.</i>
Reminds him a lot of the other one.
And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy...
'cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it will be like... helping that other one too.
[Whispering]
How does the story end?
I don't know.
[Whispering] I wanna tell you my secret now.
Okay.
I see dead people.
In your dreams?
While you're awake?
Dead people, like, in graves, in coffins?
Walking around like regular people.
<i>They don't see each other.</i>
<i>They only see what they wanna see.</i>
They don't know they're dead.
How often do you see them?
All the time.
<i>They're everywhere.</i>
<i>You won't tell anyone my secret, right?</i>
No. I promise.
Will you stay here until I fall asleep?
Of course.
<i>[Tape Recorder Clicks]</i>
<i>[Malcolm] Cole has pathologies more severe than initially assessed.</i>
He's suffering from visual hallucinations,

Some kind of... school-age schizophrenia.
Medication, hospitalization may be required.
And I'm not helping him.

<i>[Cole] Did you think the play sucked big time?</i>

What?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial.
He said everyone was self-conscious and unrealistic.
He said the play sucked big time.
This Tommy kid sounds like a real punk.
<i>I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats."</i>
"Cats"?
Never mind.
Cole, I was really interested in what you told me at the hospital.
I'd like to hear more about it.
Cole?
What?
Is something up there?
Cole,
I don't see anything.
Be real still.
Sometimes you feel it inside, like you're falling down real fast, but you're really just standing still.
You ever feel the prickly things on the back of your neck?
Yes.
And the tiny hairs on your arm, you know, when they stand up?
Yes.
That's them.
When they get mad, it gets cold.
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?
Cole?
Please make them leave.
I'm workin' on it.
Come on.
Aah!
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
Mommy, Daddy?
[Coughing]
My throat hurts.
Run! Run!
[Male Announcer] Pedia Ease cough suppressant.
Gentle, fast, effect...
Cole.
I don't care what they say, this thing is broken.
Take 'em off.
I don't want them on my table.
I saw what was in your bureau drawer when I was cleaning.
Got something you want to confess?
Hmm?
The bumblebee pendant?
Why do you keep taking it?
It was Grandma's.
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.
<i>You'd cry 'cause you miss Grandma so much.</i>
That's right.
Sometimes people think they lose things, and they really didn't lose them... it just gets moved.
So, did you move the bumblebee pendant?
Don't get mad.
So, who moved it this time?
Maybe someone came in our house, took the bumblebee pendant out of my closet... and placed it nicely in your drawer.
<i>- Maybe.
[Sighs] God, I am so tired, Cole.</i>
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,
I'm... tired in my heart.
I need some help.
You know, I don't know if you noticed, but our little family isn't doing so good.
I mean,
I've been praying, but I must not be praying right.
Looks like we're just gonna have to answer each other's prayers.
If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it.
Now, tell me, baby.
I-I-I won't get mad, honey.
Did you take the bumblebee pendant?
<i>- No.
[Silverware Clattering]</i>

Baby, why are you shaking?
Cole, what's wrong?
Oh, God, please tell me!
Oh, please.
[Sobbing]
Oh.
It's Edwardian, beautifully worked... with mine-cut diamonds and an actual color Burmese sapphire.
It's timeless.
<i>- Oh.
[Door Closes, Bells Jingling]</i>
You, uh...
[Clears Throat]
Got anything a little plainer?
Plainer? You want a plain ring to go with your plain fiancé?
Is that how it is?
No! Baby, don't get in a tissy.
Uh...
You're so beautiful.
You're like a Burmese sapphire all by yourself.
You don't need all that.
Uh-huh.
Why don't you try it on... and see how you both feel about it.
There. How does that feel?
I think this piece, um, communicates a longing.
I imagine that the woman who owned it... loved a man that she couldn't be with.
Did he have wavy hair and chestnut eyes?
Huh?
Um, I don't know, but... a lot of the pieces in this store communicate, and I think you should choose a piece that speaks to you.
I think maybe when people own things and then they pass away, a part of themselves gets printed on those things, like... like fingerprints.
I'll just wrap it up.
You don't need a guy with a Master's.
You need a wrestler with a neck larger than his head.
[Chuckles]
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.
What's this?
Happy birthday.
For me?
Mm-hmm.
It's a... first edition.
Wow.

Can't be your doctor anymore.
I haven't paid enough attention to my family.
Bad things happen when you do that.
Do you understand?
I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychologists.
Don't fail me.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me, I know it.
I can't help you.
[Sobbing]
You...
Someone else can help you.
You believe me, right?
Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret, right?
I don't know how to answer that, Cole.
How can you help me... if you don't believe me?
Some magic's real.
<i>[Vincent] Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone?</i>
I do.
I do.
<i>[Door Opening, Closing]</i>
<i>[Malcolm's Voice]
I'm sorry, Vincent. I hope I didn't leave you alone too long.</i>
Whew.
It's cold in here.
<i>[Vincent Sobbing Quietly]</i>
<i>Vincent, why are you crying?</i>
<i>[Vincent Sniffles] You won't believe.</i>
<i>[Malcolm] Sorry, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.</i>
<i>Whew.
It's cold in here.</i>
<i>- Vincent...
[Tape Machine Rewinding]</i>
<i>Whew.
It's cold in here.</i>
<i>- [Tape Machine Clicks]
Nah, you know what?
I never liked him either.</i>
<i>When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,</i>
<i>- and I threw up chili cheese fries all over this male nurse.
[Vincent Laughing]</i>
<i>[Woman] Excuse me.
Dr. Reed is on line two.</i>
<i>[Malcolm] Vincent, will you excuse me? I have to take this.</i>
<i>- Just give me a minute, okay?
[Vincent] Okay.</i>
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

<i>[Faint Voice Continues]</i>
<i>[Man Speaking In Spanish]</i>
<i>[Man Sobbing] No entiendes.</i>
Yo no quiero morir.
<i>[Continues Speaking In Spanish]</i>
Yo no quiero morir.
Oh, my God.
Yo no quiero morir!
<i>You been running around?</i>
Make you feel better?
<i>I like to run around.
It's good exercise.</i>
Do you want to ask me questions now?
Want to be a lance corporal in Company
"M," Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?
We're being dispatched into the Quang Nam province.
Maybe later.
Something happened, didn't it?
You wigging out?
Yes.
I think I am.
<i>Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?</i>
<i>It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die."</i>
What do you think these ghosts want when they talk to you?
I want you to think about it, Cole.
I want you to think about it really carefully.
What do you think they want?
Just help.
That's right. That's what I think too.
They just want help, even the scary ones.
I think I might know a way to make them go away.
How?
Listen to them.
What if they don't want help?
What if they're just angry and they just want to hurt somebody?
I don't think that's the way it works.
How do you know for sure?
I don't.
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>
[Engine Starts]
Hey!
[Tires Squealing]
Hey! Hey!
<i>[Lynn Sobbing] What's happening?</i>
<i>[Whispering]
What's happening?</i>
<i>Go!
[Sobbing]</i>
<i>[Quietly Sobbing]</i>
<i>[Breathing Heavily]</i>
What's happening to you?
Is someone hurting you?
I'll kick their ass.
Cole, if they're hurting you... [Sobbing]
[Moans]
Mama, you sleep now.
[Exhales Deeply]
[Panting]
<i>[Snapping]</i>
<i>[Whimpering]</i>
[Sobbing]
[Swallowing]
<i>[Gagging, Panting]</i>
[Sobbing]
I'm feeling much better now.
[Quivering] Do you want to tell me something?
<i>[Hydraulic Brakes Hissing]</i>
[Gasps]
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I guess she did.
[Sobbing]
Can you get some water?
That's her sister.
<i>You know, when I went through this with my father's cancer...</i>
I just can't imagine a child being in bed for two years.
<i>[Woman] How many...
How many doctors?</i>
<i>- I think it was six.
Six different doctors?</i>
<i>I think so, yes.</i>
<i>I just heard the, uh, little one is falling ill now.</i>
God help them.
Don't go home, okay?
I definitely won't.
Aah!
[Panting]
Mister?
Excuse me, mister.
Are you
Kyra's daddy?
It's for you.
Sh-She wanted to tell you something.
[Static]
[Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!
<i>Would you like to dance?</i>
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.
Oh, well, how about this?
We can dance for a little bit, and if you don't like the way I dance, you can kick me.
<i>Oh, okay then.</i>
<i>[Liquid Pouring]</i>
<i>[Woman] It's time for lunch, Kyra.</i>
<i>- [Kyra] I'm feeling much better now.
That's so great, honey.</i>
<i>[Kisses]
It's time for your food.</i>
Can I go outside if I eat this?
I don't know. You know how you get sick in the afternoons.
<i>We'll see.</i>
<i>Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.</i>
Tami's mom called.
You were keeping her sick.
You liked it, she said.
<i>She looked out for you.</i>
Is Kyra coming back?
<i>[Cole] Not anymore.</i>
<i>[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.</i>
<i>[Cole] Okay.</i>
They're calling for the stable boy.
We have to hurry!
Who, uh...
Who were you talking to?
Just practicing my lines.
<i>Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.</i>
You know, when I went to school here, there was a terrible fire in this section of the theater.
They rebuilt the whole thing.
Yeah, I know.
[Audience Sighing]
Only he who is pure of heart can take the sword from the stone.
Let the boy try.
<i>[Scattered Applause]</i>
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.
<i>- Silence, village idiot.
[Scattered Giggling]</i>
Let the boy step forward.
[Children Gasping]
<i>[Children Together]
Hail, King Arthur!</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>
<i>[Children] Yea!</i>
<i>- [Cheering]
[Applause Continues]</i>
<i>[Audience Laughing]</i>
[All Laughing]
<i>[Chattering]</i>
<i>[Malcolm] I thought you were really great in the play, Cole.</i>
<i>- Really?
Yeah.</i>
<i>- You know what else?
What?</i>
I thought Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time. [Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
<i>I got an idea how you can talk to your wife.</i>
Wait till she's asleep.
Then she'll listen to you and she won't even know it.
I'm not gonna see you anymore, am I?
I think we said everything we needed to say.
<i>Maybe it's time to say things to someone closer to you.</i>
Maybe we can pretend like we're gonna see each other tomorrow.
Just for pretend.
Okay.
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>
I'll see you tomorrow, Cole.
[Siren Blaring]
[Chattering, Indistinct]
I'm okay, Officer.
I-I'm okay.
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>
[Lynn] Hmm.
Geez, I hope nobody got hurt.
You're very quiet.
You're mad I missed the play, aren't you?
I have two jobs, baby.
You know how important they are for us.
[Sighs]
I'd give anything to have been there.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Communicate?
Tell you my secrets.
What is it?
You know the accident up there?
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady.
She died.
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?
Yes.
Where is she?
Standing next to my window.
Cole, you're scaring me.
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
Ghosts.
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
They...
They talk to you?
<i>They tell you to do things?</i>
<i>They're the ones that used to hurt me.</i>
<i>What are you thinking, Mama?</i>
You think I'm a freak?
Look at my face.
I would never think that about you. Ever.
<i>- Got it?
Got it.</i>
Just let me think for a minute.
Grandma says hi.
<i>She says she's sorry for taking the bumblebee pendant.</i>
<i>She just likes it a lot.</i>
What?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
Cole, that's very wrong.
<i>- Grandma's gone, you know that.
I know.</i>
She wanted me to tell you...
Cole, please stop.
She wanted me to tell you she saw you dance.
<i>She said when you were little,</i>
<i>you and her had a fight...</i> right before your dance recital.
<i>- [Sniffles]
You thought she didn't come to see you dance.</i>
She did.
<i>She hid in the back so you wouldn't see.</i>
<i>Sh-She said you were like an angel.</i>
<i>- [Sobbing]
She said...</i> you came to the place where they buried her, asked her a question.
She said the answer is... every day.
<i>What did you ask?</i>
[Sniffles]
[Voice Breaking]
Do...
Do I make her proud?
[Sobbing]
Mama.
[Sobbing]
<i>[Laughing, Chattering]</i>
<i>[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,</i>
<i>I'm not used to doing this,</i> and I promised Anna that I'd try not to embarrass her.
<i>I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]</i>
<i>But we do want to thank all of you for coming...</i>
<i>and for sharing this wonderful day with us.</i>
<i>It's bittersweet almost, for me,</i>
<i>'cause I hate giving her up.</i>
<i>[Malcolm] Anna?</i>
<i>[Applause On Television]</i>
I miss you.
I miss you too.
Why, Malcolm?
What?
What is it?
Why did you leave me?
I didn't leave you.
<i>[Object Clatters]</i>
<i>[Cole] I see people.</i>
They don't know they're dead.
<i>- [Malcolm] How often do you see them?
[Cole] All the time.</i>
<i>[Cole] They're everywhere.</i>
<i>They only see what they want to see.</i>
<i>[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.</i>
Come on.
Give me a minute.
<i>[Doorknob Turning]</i>
[Panting]
[Exhales Deeply]
[Shivering]
<i>[Gunshot]</i>
<i>[Anna Screams]</i>
<i>[Whimpering]</i>
Oh, God.
[Groaning]
<i>- [Mumbling] It doesn't even hurt.
Let me see.</i>
Let me see. Put your hand...
[Groaning]
Oh, God.
[Breathing Heavily]
Okay.
[Grunts]
[Sobbing]
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went... went in and out.
It doesn't even hurt anymore.
I think
I can go now.
I just needed to do a couple things.
I needed to help someone.
I think I did.
And I needed to tell you something.
You were never second.
Ever.
<i>I love you.</i>
You sleep now.
Everything will be different in the morning.
Good night,
Malcolm.
Good night, sweetheart.
