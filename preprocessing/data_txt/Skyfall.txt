Ronson's down.
He needs medical evac.
M (OVER EARPlECE):
Where is it? Is it there?
Hard drive's gone.
M: Are you sure? lt's gone. Give me a minute.
They must have it.
Get after them. l'm stabilizing Ronson.
We don't have the time. l have to stop the bleeding !
Leave him!
BOND: Have you got him?
He's in the black Audi.
What about Ronson?
He's been hit.
We're sending an emergency evacuation squad.
They'll be too bloody late!
He's seen us.
Medical evac for Ronson five minutes away.
That's all right.
You weren't using it. l wasn't using that one, either.
Keep your head down.
Just get clear!
Tanner, which way?
Keep going. l can direct you from here.
You both know what's at stake here.
We can't afford to lose that list.
Yes, ma'am.
EVE: Where are they now?
They appear to be on the rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.
Down, sir!
What happened?
They're on the train, ma'am.
What do you mean on the train? l mean, they're on top of a train.
Well, get after them, for God's sake!
She's going out of range.
We've lost tracking.
We're blind here.
What's going on?
I'm stiII with them.
Get me CCTV, satellite, anything !
M: What was that?
VW Beetles. l think.
Bond !
He's uncoupling the cars.
M: 007, are you all right?
Just changing carriages.
What's going on? Report! lt's rather hard to explain, ma'am.
007's still in pursuit.
Looks like there isn't much more road. l don't think l can go any further. l may have a shot. lt's not clean.
Repeat,
I do not have a cIean shot.
There's a tunnel ahead. l'm gonna lose them.
Can you get into a better position?
Negative. There's no time.
Take the shot.
I said take the shot. l can't! l may hit Bond.
Take the bloody shot!
Agent down.
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end l've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, l'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall
Where you go l go
What you see l see l know l'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall lt's like being summoned to the headmaster's study. lt's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.
Bloody waste of my time is what l call it. l'm sorry to have to deal with such a delicate subject at our first encounter.
But, um. . . l have to be frank with you. l think that would be a good idea.
The Prime Minister's concerned.
Well, you can tell him my operatives are pursuing every avenue.
Have you considered pulling out the agents? l've considered every option.
Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion.
Forgive me, but why am l here?
Three months ago, you lost the computer drive containing the identity of almost every
NATO agent embedded in terrorist organizations across the globe.
A list which, in the eyes of our allies, never existed.
So if you'll forgive me, l think you know why you're here.
Are we to call this
"civilian oversight"?
No, we're to call this "retirement planning."
Your country has only the highest respect for you and your many years of service.
When your current posting is completed, you'll be awarded
GCMG with full honors.
Congratulations.
You're firing me.
No, ma'am, l'm here to oversee the transition period leading to your voluntary retirement in two months' time.
Your successor has yet to be appointed, so we'll be asking you. . . l'm not an idiot, Mallory. l know l can't do this job forever but l'll be damned if l'm going to leave the department in worse shape than l found it.
M, you've had a great run.
You should leave with dignity.
Oh, to hell with dignity. l'll leave when the job's done.
Yes?
Now?
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch.
Someone's trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.
We're tracing the encryption signal.
Localizing now.
Centering in the UK.
London.
Get us back to base as soon as possible. lt's coming from Ml6.
What?
The data packet is linking to our network.
Correction.
This is behind our firewall.
We should shut down.
No, track it.
We have to know where it's coming from.
Strip the headers.
Trace the source.
How the hell did they get into our system?
Getting trace back now. lt appears. . . lt appears to be your computer, ma'am.
Shut it down.
What is this?
For God's sake!
Just get out of the way!
Don't you recognize the car?
Madam.

ANNOUNCER (OVER TV):
This is CNN Breaking News.
Emergency crews are still attempting to assess the damage as investigators hunt for leads in what now appears to be a major terrorist attack in the heart of London.
No-one has yet claimed responsibility for what sources are calling a possible
"cyber-terrorist assault" on the British Secret Service.
Early reports from the scene indicate at least six dead, many more injured, with victims being evacuated to local hospitals within minutes of the explosion. lt's time to go, ma'am. l'm going to find whoever did this.
Where the hell have you been?
Enjoying death.
007 reporting for duty.
Why didn't you call?
You didn't get the postcard?
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all. lt really lends perspective.
Ran out of drink where you were, did they?
What was it you said?
"Take the bloody shot." l made a judgment call.
You should have trusted me to finish the job. lt was the possibility of losing you or the certainty of losing all those other agents. l made the only decision l could and you know it. l think you lost your nerve.
What do you expect, a bloody apology?
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.
We both have.
Maybe too long.
Speak for yourself.
Ronson didn't make it, did he?
No.
So this is it.
We're both played out.
Well, if you believe that, why did you come back?
Good question.
Because we're under attack.
And you know we need you.
Well, l'm here.
You'll have to be debriefed and declared fit for active service.
You can only return to duty when you've passed the tests, so take them seriously.
And a shower might be in order. l'll go home and change.
Oh, we've sold your flat, put your things into storage.
Standard procedure on the death of an unmarried employee with no next of kin.
You should have called. l'll find a hotel.
Well, you're bloody well not sleeping here.
TANNER: The assailant hacked into the environmental control system, locked out the safety protocols and turned on the gas, all of which should have been impossible.
On top of that, they hacked into her files.
They knew her appointments, knew she'd be out of the building.
They weren't targeting her.
They wanted her to see it.
Where are we, Tanner?
New digs.
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".
That's putting it mildly.
He was able to breach the most secure computer system in Britain.
So we're on war footing now.
This was part of
Churchill's bunker.
We're still discovering tunnels dating back to the 1 8th Century.
Quite fascinating, if it wasn't for the rats.
When do l see M?
Tomorrow you'll see
M and Mallory, too, if you're lucky.
Who's Mallory?
The new Chairman of the lntelligence and Security Committee.
Charming man. l think you and he are really going to hit it off.
Welcome to the new Ml6.
We've attempted to trace the computer message, but it was sent by an asymmetrical security algorithm, which bounced the signal all over the globe through over a thousand different servers.
And now that they've accessed M's codes, it's only a matter of time before they're able to decrypt the list.
Q-Branch have been analyzing the picture but so far nothing.
The general feeling is it's probably someone from her past.
Perhaps when she was running things in Hong Kong.
She's no idea what it all means.
You believe that?
The truth is, we don't have a clue who took the list or what they plan to do with it.
We can always do this later.
You know what? Let's. l'd like to start with some simple word associations.
Just tell me the first word that pops into your head.
For example, l might say "Day" and you might say. . .
Wasted.
All right.
Gun.
Shot.
Agent.
Provocateur.
Woman.
Provocatrix.

Target.
Bird.

Well, this is going well.
Get these analyzed.
For her eyes only.
She's ready for you. l'm sorry, have we met before? l'm the one who should say "sorry". lt was only four ribs.
Some of the less vital organs.
Nothing major.
Not enough excitement in lstanbul? l've been reassigned.
Temporary suspension from field work.
Really?
Mmm.
Something to do with killing 007.
Well, you gave it your best shot.
That was hardly my best shot. l'm not sure l could survive your best. l doubt you'll get the chance.
Well, do me a favor, will you? lf they do ever let you back out there, warn me first. l'm assisting Gareth Mallory in the transition, and then l'll be back in the field.
That's what you want?
Yes, of course. lt's not for everyone.
Ah, 007. lt's this way. ln your defense, a moving target is much harder to hit.
Then you better keep moving.
The whole office goes up in smoke and that bloody thing survives.
Your interior decorating tips have always been appreciated,
007, Gareth Mallory. l hope l haven't missed anything.
The PM does prattle on in a crisis.
Bond.
Mallory. l've just been reviewing Bond's tests. lt seems you've passed. . . by the skin of your teeth.
You're back on active service.
Congratulations.
Thank you. l'll, um. . . l'll be outside. l only have one question.
Why not stay dead?
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.
Not many field agents get to leave this cleanly.
Do you get out in the field much?
You don't need to be an operative to see the obvious. lt's a young man's game.
Look, you've been seriously injured.
There's no shame in saying you've lost a step.
The only shame would be not admitting it until it's too late.
Hire me or fire me. lt's entirely up to you. lf he says he's ready, he's ready.
Perhaps you can't see it, or maybe you won't.
What exactly are you implying?
You're sentimental about him.
As long as l'm head of this department, l'll choose my own operatives.
Fair enough.
Good luck, 007.
Don't cock it up.
We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments.
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit or it would have cut you in half. lt's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.
Hard to get, extremely expensive, and only used by a select few.
Recognize anyone?
Him.
TANNER: Okay. Name's Patrice.
He's a ghost.
No known residence or country of origin.
So how do we find him?
Well, luckily, we still have one or two friends left in the ClA.
They're after him for the Yemeni ambassador's murder, and they're getting close. lntel is he's going to be in Shanghai in two days time, probably on a job.
You're to go there and await further instructions. lf he turns up, he's yours.
Find out who he works for and who has the list.
Then terminate him, for Ronson.
With pleasure. ls there anything else you want to tell me?
No.
Report to the new Quartermaster for your documentation.
He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner will put you two together.
Good luck.
Thank you.
You are ready for this?
Yes, ma'am. l didn't know Bond passed the tests.
He didn't.
Always makes me feel a little melancholy.
A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.
The inevitability of time, don't you think?
What do you see?
A bloody big ship.
Excuse me. l'm your new Quartermaster.
You must be joking.
Why, because l'm not wearing a lab coat?
Because you still have spots.
My complexion is hardly relevant.
Well, your competence is.
Age is no guarantee of efficiency.
And youth is no guarantee of innovation. l'll hazard l can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.
Oh, so why do you need me?
Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.
Or not pulled. lt's hard to know which in your pajamas.
Q.
Ticket to Shanghai.
Documentation and passport.
Thank you.
And this.

Who's got the list?
Tell me!
Who are you working for?
Tanner. . . He's posted the first five names.
Their cover's blown.
They're in danger.
Get them out now.
WOMAN: Room service. l didn't order anything.
Not even you. l've got some new information.
Aren't you a little overqualified to be delivering messages? lt's all part of the learning curve.
And Q's afraid of flying.
Of course he is.
So whoever stole the list has already decrypted it.
They posted the first five names on the web.
Well, it was only a matter of time.
Well, that's just the start.
They're posting five more next week, and the week after. lt's some kind of sadistic game.
Cut-throat razor.
How very traditional.
Well, l like to do some things the old-fashioned way.
Sometimes the old ways are the best.
Are you putting your life in my hands again?
M's. . .
. . .already briefed me on the list.
Raising the tantalizing question of what you're really doing here.
My official directive was to help. . .
"in any way l can."
Like spying for Mallory.
You know, Mallory's not as bad as you think.
He's a bureaucrat.
You should do your homework.
Gareth Mallory was a Lieutenant Colonel. . .
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern lreland,
Hereford Regiment.
Spent three months at the hands of the lRA.
So there's more to him than meets the eye.
We'll see.
Keep still.
This is the tricky part.
Now that's better.
You look the part now.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
And what part's that?
Old dog, new tricks.
Good evening.
EVE: Evening.
Don't touch your ear. l've got three exits, lots of blind spots.
EVE: l've got them covered.
You look beautiful in that dress.
You don't scrub up so bad yourself. lt's amazing what one can do with an extra pair of hands.
You're telling me.
Do you gamble? l like a little flutter now and then.
Who doesn't like to take chances?
Good evening, sir.
How may l help you? l'd like to cash this in, please.
One moment, sir.
Good fortune tonight, sir.
Let's hope so.
With compliments of the house.
Thank you.
Now you can afford to buy me a drink.
Maybe l'll even stretch to two. l'm guessing l've got four million euros in here.
Not bad. l like this game.
Why don't we play another? l don't gamble. l'm not very lucky.
A little like our friend in Shanghai. l've been waiting to see who would redeem the chip.
You made such a bold entrance into our little drama.
Did l over-complicate the plot?
Who doesn't appreciate the occasional twist, Mr. . .?
Bond.
James Bond.
Severine.
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your next performance over that drink? l'd like that.
Will your friends be joining us?
That, l'm afraid, is inevitable.
EVE: She's pretty.
Now, now. lf you like that sort of thing. l'll keep you posted.
Perfect.
Would you mind if l asked you a business question?
Depends on the question. lt has to do with death.
A subject in which you're well-versed.
And how would you know that?
Only a certain kind of woman wears a backless dress with a Beretta 70 strapped to her thigh.
One can never be too careful when handsome men in tuxedos carry Walthers. l am correct in assuming you killed Patrice?
Yes.
Might l ask why? l want to meet your employer.
Be careful what you wish for.
You're scared.
Thank you for the drink,
Mr. Bond.
You put on a good show.
But ever since we sat down, you haven't stopped looking at your bodyguards.
Now, three of them is a bit excessive.
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.
The tattoo on your wrist is Macau sex trade.
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 1 2? 1 3? l'm guessing he was your way out.
Perhaps you thought you were in love.
But that was a long time ago.
You know nothing about it. l know when a woman is afraid and pretending not to be.
How much do you know about fear?
All there is.
Not like this.
Not like him. l can help you. l don't think so.
Let me try.
How?
Bring me to him.
Can you kill him?
Yes.
Will you?
Someone usually dies.
Perhaps you can.
When l leave, they're going to kill you. lf you survive, l'm on the Chimera.
North harbor.
Berth seven.
We cast off in an hour.
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.
Good luck.

Put it all on red. lt's the circle of life.
Yes! lt's time to cast off.
All right. l like you better without your Beretta. l feel naked without it.
ANCHORMAN (OVER TV):
Good evening.
The controversy surrounding the Ministry of Defence has escalated today as images of the Husein assassination continue to circulate.
We should warn you, some viewers might find these images disturbing.
Captain Husein, an Ml6 operative embedded in the Middle East, was one of the five agents exposed in what is now being considered the greatest internal security breach in modern British history.
The Prime Minister continues to express public support for Ml6 while the opposition has taken the position...
Has taken the position we're a bunch of antiquated bloody idiots fighting a war we don't understand and can't possibly win.
Look, three of my agents are dead already.
Don't embroil me in politics now.
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy, accountable to the people we're trying to defend.
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.
You don't get this, do you?
Whoever's behind this, whoever's doing it, he knows us.
He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond.
The place you say doesn't exist.
The shadows. lt's not too late.
We could turn back now. l wouldn't be so sure.
They abandoned it almost overnight.
He made them think there was a leak at the chemical plant. lt's amazing the panic you can cause with a single computer.
He wanted the island, so he took it.
Does he always get what he wants?
More than you know. l'm sorry.
Hello, James. Welcome.
Do you like the island?
My grandmother had an island.
Nothing to boast of.
You could walk around it in an hour.
But still, it was, it was a paradise for us.
One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats!
They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut.
So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm?
My grandmother showed me.
We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid, then wired coconut to the lid as bait.
And the rats would come for the coconut and. . .
. . .they would fall into the drum.
And after a month, you have trapped all the rats.
But what do you do then?
Throw the drum into the ocean?
Burn it? No.
You just leave it.
And they begin to get hungry.
And one by one. . .
. . .they start eating each other until there are only two left.
The two survivors.
And then what?
Do you kill them? No.
You take them and release them into the trees.
But now they don't eat coconut anymore.
Now they only eat rat.
You have changed their nature.
The two survivors, this is what she made us. l made my own choices.
You think you did.
That's her genius.
Station H.
Am l right? Hong Kong.
Mm-hmm.
'86 to '97.
Back then, l was her favorite.
And you're not nearly the agent l was, l can tell you that.
Just look at you, barely held together by your pills and your drink.
Don't forget my pathetic love of country.
You're still clinging to your faith in that old woman.
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.
No?
No.
What did you score in your marksmanship evaluation?
Did she tell you the psychologist cleared you for duty?
Yes.
No. No.
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.
Psychological evaluation:
"Alcohol
"and substance addiction indicated."
"Pathological rejection of authority
"based on unresolved childhood trauma."
"Subject is not approved for field duty
"and immediate suspension from service advised."
What is this if not betrayal?
She sent you after me knowing you're not ready, knowing you'll likely die.
Mommy was very bad !
Hmm?
Ooh.
See what she's done to you?
Well, she never tied me to a chair.
Her loss.
Are you sure this is about M? lt's about her.
And you, and me.
You see, we are the last two rats.
We can either eat each other. . .
Hmm?
. . .or eat everyone else.
How you're trying to remember your training now.
What's the regulation to cover this?
Well, first time for everything. Yes?
What makes you think this is my first time?
Oh, Mr. Bond !
All that physical stuff. . .
So dull, so dull.
Chasing spies. . . so old-fashioned !
Your knees must be killing you.
England.
The Empire! Ml6!
You're living in a ruin as well, you just don't know it yet.
At least here there are no old ladies giving orders and no little. . .

Done.
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda. All to the highest bidder.
Or a gas explosion in London.
Just point and click.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
So what's yours?
Resurrection.
Let me show you something.

Tells a story, doesn't it?
They left the island so quickly, they couldn't decide what to take, what to leave, what was important.
And seeing this every day reminds me to focus on the essentials.
There's nothing. . .nothing superfluous in my life.
When a thing is redundant, it is eliminated.
50-year-old Macallan.
A particular favorite of yours, l understand.
So, what's the toast?
"To the women we love"?
Hmm.

Darling, your lovers are here.
No, no, no, no.
Stand up straight.
Keep still.
And whatever you do, don't lose your head.
Don't lose. . . your head.
Don't lose your head.
Time to redeem your marksmanship scores.
Let's see.
Who can be the first to knock the glass from her head?
And just to be sporting, l'll let you go first.
Let's see who ends up on top.
Oh, l can't believe it. l can't believe it!
Did you really die that day? ls there any, any of the old 007 left?
My turn. l win.
What do you say to that? lt's a waste of good Scotch.
What are you going to do now?
Take me back to her?
All on your own?
Who says l'm on my own? lt's the latest thing from Q-Branch. lt's called a radio.
All right, time to say hello.
You're smaller than l remember!
Whereas l barely remember you at all.
Strange. For me, it feels just like yesterday.
Are you surprised?
Not particularly.
But then you always were a slippery one.
Maybe that's why you liked me so much.
You flatter yourself.
No remorse.
Just as l had imagined.
Regret is unprofessional.
"Regret is unprofessional."
They kept me for five months in a room with no air. They tortured me.
And l protected your secrets. l protected you.
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.
And suffer.
Until l realized. . .
. . .it was you who betrayed me.
You betrayed me.
So, l had only one thing left.
My cyanide capsule in my back left molar.
You remember, right?
So l broke the tooth and. . .
. . .bit into the capsule.
And it. . . lt burned all my insides.
But l didn't die.
Life clung to me like a disease.
And then. . . l understood why l had survived. l needed to look in your eyes one last time.
Well, l hope it was worth it.
Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prison where you'll be remanded in custody until the Crown
Prosecution Service deem you fit to stand trial for. . .
Say my name. Say it.
My real name. l know you remember it.
Your name is on the memorial wall of the very building you attacked. l will have it struck off.
Soon your past will be as nonexistent as your future. l'll never see you again.
Do you know what it does to you?
Hydrogen cyanide?
Look upon your work,
Mother.
Let me know what you recover from his computer.
Has he transmitted the lists? lf so, to whom? l want this resolved.
Yes, ma'am.
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.
He was a brilliant agent.
But he started operating beyond his brief, hacking the Chinese.
The handover was coming up and they were onto him, so l gave him up. l got six agents in return and a peaceful transition.
We should go, ma'am.
Board of lnquiry begins in 30 minutes. l want to know what's on that computer.
Now, looking at
Silva's computer, it seems to me he's done a number of slightly unusual things.
He's established failsafe protocols to wipe the memory if there's any attempt to access certain files.
Only six people in the world could program safeguards like that.
Of course there are.
Can you get past them? l invented them.
Right, then.
Let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Silva.
We're in.
Sir, what do you make of this? lt's his Omega site.
Most encrypted level he has.
Looks like obfuscated code to conceal its true purpose.
Security through obscurity.
Ladies and gentlemen, if l might have order? l'd like to begin the proceedings.
We're gathered today to address important issues concerning the future of our national security.
Going somewhere?
So you believe your stewardship of Ml6 during the recent crisis has been up to scratch?
Well, l believe we have apprehended the responsible party and are taking all necessary steps to ensure that the sensitive information is contained.
Oh, so it's a job well done. l'm not saying it's gone perfectly, but. . .
You'll forgive me for not putting up the bunting. l find it rather difficult to overlook monumental security breaches and dead operatives for which you are almost single-handedly responsible.
He's using a polymorphic engine to mutate the code.
Whenever l try to gain access, it changes. lt's like solving a Rubik's cube that's fighting back.
Stop.
Go in on that.
Granborough.
Granborough Road. lt's an old Tube station on the Metropolitan Line.
Been closed for years.
Use that as a key.
Oh, look, it's a map! lt's London.
Subterranean London.
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?
Oh, no.
Can someone tell me how the hell he got into our system?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, shit, shit.
He hacked us.
Oh, no.
Q.
He's gone. l'm in a stairwell below isolation.
Do you read me, Q? l can hear you. l'm looking for you.
Got you.
Tracking your location.
Just keep moving forward.
Enter the next service door on your right. lf you're through that door, you should be in the Tube. l'm in the Tube.
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.
He wanted us to capture him, he wanted us to access his computer. lt was all planned.
Blowing up HQ.
Knowing the emergency protocols.
Knowing we'd retreat down here. l've got all that. lt's what he's got planned next that worries me.
District Line is the closest.
There's a service door on your left.
Got it. lt won't open. lt will.
Put your back into it.
Why don't you come down here and put your back into it?
No, it's stuck.
Oh, good.
There's a train coming.
Hmm. That's vexing. l'm through.
Told you.
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.
Where are you now?
Temple Tube station.
Along with half of London.
Oh, l see you. There you are. l know where l am, Q.
Where's he?
Give us a second. l'm looking for him.
ANNOUNCER: Mind the gap.
BOND: There's too many people. l can't see him.
Welcome to rush hour on the Tube.
Not something you'd know much about.
Mind the gap.
The train's leaving.
Do l get on the train?
Don't get on. l'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.
Do l get on the train?
Bond.
What?
Get on the train.
He's keen to get home.
Will you open the door, please?
Open the door.
Health and Safety.
Carry on.
Q: Where are you?
Take a wild guess, Q.
He's in disguise, dressed as a policeman.
Of course he is.
Where's he going?
Where's he going?
He's going for M.
Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.
You've overlooked, or chosen to ignore, hard evidence and consistently, almost obstinately. . .
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.
We need to get you to a secure location immediately. l'll be damned if l'm gonna show her my back.
Are we straining your attention?
No. Please, Minister, proceed.
Excuse me.
Move! Move! lt's as if you insist on pretending we still live in a golden age of espionage where human intelligence was the only resource available.
Well, l find this rather old-fashioned belief demonstrates a reckless disregard for. . .
Excuse me, Minister, l don't mean to interrupt, but just for the sake of variety, might we actually hear from the witness?
Of course.
Thank you.
Oh ! l won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.
Not bad. Not bad, James, for a physical wreck.
Oi. Thank you.
You caught me.
Now, here's your prize.
The latest thing from my local toy store. lt's called radio.
Whew! l do hope that wasn't for me.
No.
But that is.
M: Chairman, Ministers.
Today l've repeatedly heard how irrelevant my department has become.
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section? lsn't it all rather quaint?
Well, l suppose l see a different world than you do.
And the truth is that what l see frightens me. l'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us.
They do not exist on a map.
They're not nations.
They are individuals.
Look around you.
Who do you fear?
Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.
Our world is not more transparent now. lt's more opaque. lt's in the shadows.
That's where we must do battle.
So, before you declare us irrelevant, ask yourselves, how safe do you feel? l've just one more thing to say.
My late husband was a great lover of poetry.
And, um. . . l suppose some of it sunk in, despite my best intentions.
And here today l remember this, l think from Tennyson:
"We are not now that strength,
"which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;
"That which we are, we are;
"One equal temper of heroic hearts,
"Made weak by time
"and fate,
"but strong in will
"To strive, to seek,
"to find
"and not to yield."
Go, go, go, go!
Move!
Move! Go! Move! what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?
That would be one way of looking at it.
Too many people are dying because of me. lf he wants you, he'll have to come and get you.
We've been one step behind Silva from the start. lt's time to get out in front, change the game.
And l'm to be the bait?
All right.
But just us.
No one else.
Q? l need help. l'm tracking the car.
Where are you going? l've got M.
We're about to disappear.
What? l need you to lay a trail of breadcrumbs impossible to follow for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it? l'm guessing this isn't strictly official.
Not even remotely.
So much for my promising career in espionage. l'm not hiding in there, if that's your brilliant plan.
We're changing vehicles.
Trouble with company cars is they have trackers.
Oh, and l suppose that's completely inconspicuous.
Get in. lt's not very comfortable, is it?
Are you gonna complain the whole way?
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if l care.
Where are we going?
Back in time.
Somewhere we'll have the advantage. lt's a fine line.
Make the breadcrumb too small and he might miss it.
Too big and Silva will smell a rat.
But do you think even Silva will be able to spot that?
He's the only one who could.
Sir.
Oh.
What are you doing?
We're just. . .monitoring.
Creating a false tracking signal for Silva to follow.
Well, sir, um. . .
Well, no.
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.
Send him on the A9. lt's the direct route.
You can monitor his progress more accurately and confirm it with the traffic cameras.
But what if the PM finds out?
Then we're all buggered.
Carry on. ls this where you grew up?
Mm.
How old were you when they died?
You know the answer to that.
You know the whole story.
Orphans always make the best recruits.
Storm's coming.
Christ.
Mm-hmm.
No wonder you never came back.
James.
James Bond.
BOND: Good God.
Are you still alive? lt's nice to see you, too.
M, this is Kincade.
Gamekeeper here since l was a boy.
Pleased to meet you, Emma.
Mr. Kincade.
You're a tad late.
They've sold the place, when they thought you were dead. lt seems they were wrong.
What are you doing here?
Some men are coming to kill us.
But we're gonna kill them first.
Then we'd better get ready.
Do we still have a gun room?
Ah.
They sold the lot to a collector from ldaho or some such place.
They were shipped out weeks ago.
There's just. . . your father's old hunting rifle.
We couldn't let that go.
And this is what we've got.
There might be a couple of sticks of dynamite from the quarry.
But if all else fails, sometimes the old ways are the best.
So who is it we're supposed to be fighting?
No "we" in it, Kincade.
This is not your fight.
Try and stop me, you jumped-up little shit.
Now, remember what l taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left. l'll do my best.
What did you say you did for a living?
Emma! l brought you some things.
The nights get cold here.
Thank you, Mr. Kincade. lt's a beautiful old house.
She is.
And like all great ladies, she still has her secret ways.
Let me show you this.
Priest's hole?
Yeah, from Reformation times.
The tunnel leads under the moor. lf you get in danger, this is the place to come.
The night l told him his parents had died, he hid in here for two days.
When he did come out. . . he wasn't a boy anymore.
Eh. Must get on. l fucked this up, didn't l?
No.
You did your job. l read your obituary of me.
And?
Appalling.
Yeah, l knew you'd hate it. l did call you "an exemplar of British fortitude".
That bit was all right.
You ready? l was ready before you were born, son.
Welcome to Scotland.
You dropped something.
You hurt?
Only my pride. l never was a good shot.
He's not here.
Always got to make an entrance.
You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.
Get behind the arch !
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.
Everyone, listen to me!
Don't you dare touch her.
She's mine.
Can your friend come out and say hello?
Come on. This way. l always hated this place.
Are you getting warm?
Just make sure Bond's dead !
Now it's me and her.
You see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond?
All this jumping and fighting. lt's exhausting !
Relax.
You need to relax.
Ah, well. . .
Mother's calling. l'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.
Oh, my God.
Of course. lt had to be here. lt had to be this way.
Thank you. l can't find it no. . .
Don't.
Please. Don't.
You're hurt. You're hurt.
What have they done to you?
Free both of us.
Free both of us. . . with the same bullet.
Do it.
Only you can do it.
Do it.
Ah !
Last rat standing.
007. What took you so long?
Well, l got into some deep water.
Oh ! l suppose it's. . . too late to make a run for it?
Well, l'm game if you are. l did get one thing right.
Wow. l didn't even know you could come up here.
Hate to waste a view. l can see why. l thought you were going back out on active service. l declined.
You said it yourself, fieldwork's not for everyone. lf it helps, l feel a lot safer.
Her will was read today.
She left you this.
Maybe it was her way of telling you to take a desk job.
Just the opposite.
Thank you.
You know, we've never formally been introduced.
Well, my name's Eve.
Eve Moneypenny.
Well, l look forward to our time together,
Miss Moneypenny.
Me, too. l'm sure we'll have one or two close shaves.
Morning, 007.
Good morning, Tanner.
He'll see you now.
How's the arm, sir?
What? Oh, it's fine. lt'll get better.
All pretty shocking for someone unused to fieldwork.
So, 007. . .
Lots to be done.
Are you ready to get back to work?
With pleasure, M.
With pleasure.
