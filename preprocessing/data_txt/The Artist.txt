Get something nice for my wife. To make it up to her."
"With all your nonsense, they don't mention our movie until page 5!"
"Where are you going, Miss?
We have a picture to shot."

George. The world is talking now."

"Your movie doesn't come out until tomorrow and you're, already Hollywood's new sweetheart!
How do you explain that?"
"I don't know. Maybe because I talk and the audience can hear me."
"People are tired of old actors mugging at the camera to be understood."
"Out with the old, in with the new.
Make way for the young!"
"That's the life!"
"I've made way for you."

"No. I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean what I said..."
"But you were right.
Make way for the young..."
"It's an honor to meet you.
My father is a big fan."
"Ok. We're going now.
I'll call you soon."
"Take me home.
I want to be alone."
"How long has it been since I last paid you, Clifton?"
"One year, sir."
"You're fired."
"I'm not kidding, Clifton.
You're fired."
"Keep the car. And find yourself another job."
"I don't want another job."
