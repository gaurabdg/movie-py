OTL Releasing presents a BH Production and Goalpost Pictures
Production, in association with Automatik Entertainment,
Nervous Tick, and Film Victoria:
Upgrade.
Okay. Come on.
I love you.
You can't be an idealist and a capitalist, Asha.
- You got to pick a side.
- I think I can.
No, you can't.
I'm... I'm telling you...
Arriving at your house, Asha.
Saved by my car.
Goodbye, Handley.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay, Asha?
I'm fine.
My husband scared me.
You do realize that you're talking to a car, right?
I hear you talking to yours all the time.
At least, mine can talk back.
Hmm.
Oh, working hard, I see.
Welcome home, Asha.
Evening playlist one.
The temperature indoors is 72 degrees and the energy wall is charged at 86%.
Also, you've run out of eggs.
Oh, thanks, Kara.
Order them.
Actually,
I was working very hard today.
In fact, that right there is the celebratory beer.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
I dropped the block in the Firebird today, finished her up.
You wanna see?
I have no idea what you just said.
Okay. Well, I don't know what you do for a living either, wife, so we're even.
Yes, but is staying home all day playing with cars a living, Grey?
I don't know. Dunno.
Ow.
That hurt.
It hurt good.
- Yeah.
- You know what?
I'm actually getting kind of used to you wearing the pants in this household.
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm really settling in.
Stop it.
Well, you know, I'm never giving them back, so...
I bet you 10 bucks
I can get 'em off.
No.
Stop.
You want to print a pizza?
You wanna make a pizza?
Seems like a lot of work.
Oh. I got to drop the car off to this guy tonight, it's all done.
Oh. Boo.
Okay. Well, have fun.
What do you mean have fun?
You're coming with me.
- What?
- Yeah.
I need you to drive me home in that toy car of yours.
It's, like, 45 minutes away.
I'll push a button and end up in Canada or something.
Well, I have work to do, so I can't.
Can't lives on Won't Street, lady.
You're coming with me.
And believe me, you're gonna wanna see this guy's house.
Trust me.
So, what, he lives behind the rocks?
No. Just you wait.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Really.
After you.
What?
This is amazing.
Eron, my man.
I got the Firebird upstairs ready to go.
- You're early.
- Yeah. I...
I drive fast.
What... what is... what is the thing that you're touching?
It's my cloud.
Eron, I'd like you to meet my wife, Asha.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Yes.
Hello.
Hi.
Wait.
You're Eron Keen.
You own Vessel Computers.
Oh, my God.
Husband did not tell me who I was meeting.
I... I really love your company.
You do the most incredible things.
I'm in the industry too.
I work for Cobolt.
We specialize in robotic limbs for wounded soldiers.
I mean, we're nothing like Vessel yet, but we're getting there.
No, you're not.
I'll show you why.
Follow me.
I would like to introduce you to my present and the rest of the world's future.
I call it Stem.
Wow.
That is the most incredible little roach.
What does it do?
Literally anything.
Hmm.
It can drive anything, talk to anything, calculate anything.
It's a new, better brain.
Can it make babies and play football?
It can do things that will benefit society.
Okay. You know what he means.
I'm just saying, there's some things that people do better.
I mean, you look at that widget and you see the future.
I look at that thing,
I see 10 guys on an unemployment line.
You should try not to argue with that guy.
He's your last paying customer.
Please do not touch the steering wheel while the car is in motion.
Okay. So what's a guy like me supposed to do when his widget starts taking over the world, hmm?
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Come here.
You know, there are some benefits not having to keep your eyes on the road.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
What should I keep my eyes on?
Please put your seatbelts on.
- No fun.
- Hmm.
Leaving 601 freeway.
Hey, honey, where... where are we?
She's probably just taking us around the traffic.
No, no, no.
Wait. I'm sorry.
This is... no.
This is my old neighborhood.
This is where I grew up.
Yeah, this is New Crown.
We're... I mean, we're going in the exact opposite
- direction of the house.
- Kara, take us home.
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.
Return to the freeway, destination home.
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.
- What?
- Stop, car.
Car, stop.
Press the brake twice.
Turning left.
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
- Stop.
- Let me try this.
We're going a little too fast.
This is not supposed to be...
Shit.
There has been an accident.
Please remain seated until further instructions.
Emergency services have been contacted.
Grey.
Here to help.
Wait.
Who are you guys?
Wait.
Back up. Back up.
Stay right there, partner.
We're on TV, assholes.
Hurry.
Hey, what are you doing?
Put your mask back on.
Look, you guys, you can have my wallet, take our cards, okay?
You can have it all.
Thanks for your permission.
Don't you fucking touch her.
You look at me and see a real piece of shit on your shoe, don't you?
A learned woman like yourself looking down on an uneducated insect like me.
No!
No!
No!
There's four hostiles, two prone.
Asha!
Asha!
Till death do us part.
Asha, I can't get to you.
I can't move.
Asha, stay with me, okay?
Look at me, honey.
Okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here, okay, Asha?
I'm right here. Okay?
No. No. Asha.
Asha, no. Pl...
Getting around, you're gonna need this, they're all throughout the house.
I mean, everything that's installed just allows you to live a more normal life.
Oh, these robotic arms are fully capable of preparing meals for you.
Let's say you wanted a protein shake, you would just say,
"Protein shake."
Your mother also has voice control authority over the arms.
Would you like to do the honors, ma'am?
Heh. Sure.
Protein shake.
Oh, my Lord. Ha, ha.
Oh, heh...
There you go.
I think we'll be fine from here.
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.
Oh, thank you.
Charging now complete.
Are you there, Grey?
Would you like something?
May I ask if Asha will be joining us for dinner?
You know, you don't have to stay here day and night, Mom.
You know, these machines they installed pretty much do everything for me.
I know.
Now, it's okay.
It's okay.
That's it. That's it. That's it.
Detective Cortez.
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Grey.
All right. This is me.
Here. You can have a seat here.
Thanks.
You know, I'm from New Crown,
Grey, like you.
Went to Hellier High.
So what do you have?
Okay.
I know you were anxious to come down here and see how we're getting things done, and I think that's great.
I'm a face-to-face person myself.
You know,
I don't pilot these drones.
I like to get my hands dirty.
- Bang on doors.
- So who are these guys?
We don't know yet.
I do have a list of people of interest in that area.
And just this week,
I brought in two people
- for questioning.
- So what you're saying is you have all these things flying above our heads, they can read the ID chips in our fillings, but they don't actually do anything?
No. I... I mean, yes, they work, but it's not that simple.
Criminals can find ways around them.
If they can find the right people, criminals can get a firewall built around them that prevents our drones from identifying their faces.
Believe me, I understand your frustration, I do.
I know I can't tie my shoes anymore, Detective, but you don't have to talk to me like I'm a goddamn three-year-old.
Grey, she's just trying to help.
I'm going to work through my list, and if you want to work with me, we're gonna find them.
How can I work with you?
I can't even stand.
Administer p.m. medicine.
Problem.
Administer p.m. medicine.
Again.
Administer p.m. medicine.
Problem. Again.
Again.
I cannot administer any more medication, Grey.
No. You... you didn't do it right.
You didn't do... you didn't do it right.
Administer p.m. medicine.
Another dosage could be fatal.
I will contact an ambulance to transport you to a hospital if you are in serious pain.
Not gonna give you bird flu, kid.
I don't leave my house very often.
Must be frustrating for you.
You're someone who liked to get things done with their hands.
Now you can't.
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?
I'm not around enough people to know the difference.
Okay. Here's the difference.
What the fuck do you want, Eron?
Grey...
What if I told you
I could offer you something that would enable you to walk again?
That computer chip that I showed you, it has the potential to change everything for people in your condition.
As a quadriplegic, the line connecting your brain to your limbs has been cut,
Stem would bridge that gap.
The operation would take place in my home, away from official eyes.
There'd be no more hospitals, but it would have to be our secret... for now.
Here's the thing, kid.
I'm not looking to restart my life.
I'm looking for the off switch.
You know... you were right about them.
Computers, there are things that they can't do.
They can't bring her back, Grey, but they just might be able to bring you back.
What would she want?
This is a world first.
Never before has a biomechanical fusion been asked to do so much.
It's going to feel strange initially.
The neural pathways in your brain will be trying to have a conversation with a foreign body, trying to learn to pass the baton.
The key is to let it grow into itself.
Grey, can you hear me?
Can you feel it when I do this?
My guess is this is gonna be a piecemeal process.
You shouldn't be expecting unreasonable results so soon.
Oh, my God.
Now, try to stand.
Nobody can know.
They make people like me wait years to test something like this.
But I can't wait for them.
Signing confidentiality agreements is never fun, but I bet it will feel good to do it with your own hand.
Who's moving my arms and my legs, me or your widget?
You're the one doing it all.
You're not a robot.
Stem works in service of your brain.
Your brain gives Stem a command, he makes it happen.
Close door.
Good evening, Grey.
Another package from Detective Cortez has been delivered.
Would you like...
Shut up.
Did you say,
"Shut down"?
Yeah, I did. Shut down.
May I point something out?
Hello?
Yes?
Okay, who's saying that?
I am Stem. The system operating your body for you.
Don't be afraid.
You fucking kidding me?
No.
I've gone insane.
I'm fucking insane.
Your psychological report diagnosed you with mild PTSD symptoms, but you are not insane.
Wait, so... Okay, you've been sitting there this whole time since the operation?
I have been observing everything you've observed.
Do you... do you have to talk?
If you don't want me to,
I will not.
Okay. Yeah, don't talk.
So I'm not insane?
You can talk again.
No, you are not insane.
Wait, can anybody else hear you?
No, only you.
I'm sending sound waves to your eardrum.
Can you read my mind?
No.
I can only discern speech when you talk out loud.
Now that you've allowed me to talk again, may I point something out?
In the drone surveillance footage.
Can't you see it?
See what?
The man who shot your wife, there's no gun in his hand.
She was shot, that means he had a gun.
She was shot, but not with a gun he was holding in his hand.
A gun implanted inside his hand.
Freeze the screen at the moment he fires.
The man who took Asha's purse in the left of frame, there is a marking on his wrist.
I don't see it.
I do.
I've rebuilt the image.
With your permission,
I can show you.
Just relax and let me draw.
This feels very weird.
You now have full control again, Grey.
I've... I've seen these.
It's a... a military tattoo,
I think.
I will read it.
Hold it in front of your eye.
Serk Brantner, Marine Corps,
098-422; O-Positive; Catholic; address: 414 Citrus, New Crown.
You just...
You just found this guy?
I got you, you sons of bitches.
Call Detective Cortez.
Are you sure you want
- to call Detective Cortez?
- Yes. I am sure.
You just found the guy who murdered my wife.
Do you have evidence to prove that?
End call.
Well, you saw the tattoo.
Eron has forbidden you to tell anyone about me.
Okay. Maybe I... I drew it from memory.
My reconstruction of the tattoo does not provide any real evidence unless they can correlate it exactly with the drone video,
- which they can't.
- What are you saying?
You need to be positive it's him before you alert the police.
Hey, man, he was the last one...
Sure, they do, but then he...
Lock chair.
There are no alarms inside, but it is a manual lock.
I can't help you break it.
Don't worry.
I got this.
I suggest you remove your shoes.
Grey, the table.
What about it?
Say the word "on."
On.
Say "messages."
Messages.
The name "Old Bones" keeps being mentioned.
I saw 38 references.
What is that?
It's a bar in my old neighborhood.
I can find no online address or phone number for it.
'Cause they don't go in for that sort of thing.
No, this is useless.
Off.
Hide behind the shelf.
Wait.
Wait.
Now.
Now, while you have the advantage.
Come here!
You come here to rip me off, huh?
Wait.
It's you.
I don't know how you found me, but you shouldn't be here.
- You killed my wife.
- No!
I didn't do that.
That was someone else.
It doesn't matter!
You'll need to be a little faster than that.
Why are you making me do this?
Let me know if you need my help, Grey.
Stem, help.
I need your permission to operate independently.
Permission granted.
Thank you.
Um, okay.
Uh, Stem, what are we... what are we doing, man?
Just relax.
What the fuck?
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Dear God.
Oh, look, man, stay down, please.
Um, please don't get up.
Please don't get up.
Please...
Stay down, man.
Stem, he's got a knife!
Stem!
I can see that.
We have a knife, too.
Oh.
You just stabbed him.
Are you trying to piss him off?
Okay. All right.
So, what's the plan?
What are we doing?
Stem! Stop him.
You now have full control again, Grey.
I advise that you remove any traces of your presence here.
That also means cleaning up the vomit in the sink.
Okay. Just give me... give me a second, okay?
- One second has passed.
- Look, I don't...
I didn't mean a second,
I just mean hold on, okay?
I gotta think.
I can't let you do the thinking for me right now.
I just...
I just killed somebody.
So, uh...
What do you think...
What do you think I should do?
I would suggest that you rid the house of all your fingerprints.
I... are you kidding me?
I can't remember every single thing that I touched here...
I have a record of every single thing you touched.
So, the body that came in from New Crown yesterday,
Serk Brantner?
I wanna show you what I found when I opened him up.
When I examined the wound in his throat,
I found wiring embedded in the tendons.
I'm thinking surgery.
A medical implant attached to the muscle.
I also found computer implants all throughout his chest.
I've never seen them to this extent before.
- And then there's this.
- What is it?
Appears to be some sort of weapon implant embedded within the muscle, an actual functioning gun, with a bullet-loading mechanism built into the tissue with biomechanics.
What about the boot print we scraped from the front porch?
Engine grease, mostly.
Old-fashioned engine grease.
So how am I progressing?
I can track you, Grey.
- Huh?
- I can track you.
Wait. Am I supposed to know what that means or is that one of your brain tests?
It means you have a piece of my property inside of you.
A very expensive piece of property.
Serk Brantner, homicide suspect list.
Did you really think
I would let that property out of my sight for even one second?
Did you forget that this operation was to be done in secret?
That if even the slightest thing were to go wrong during this trial period, it would all be for nothing?
He knows everything.
Don't lie to him.
Search drone footage archives.
Alley behind 414 Citrus Avenue,
New Crown,
October 14th, 3:00 p.m.
No, I didn't forget it.
I remembered that you asked me to keep a secret.
But it turns out that you had a couple other secrets, like, for instance, you never mentioned to me... that the thing talks!
Stem...
- talks to you?
- Yeah. It's got a mind of its own.
I can hear its voice in my head.
From now on, you will be a model patient.
You will let the computer do what it was supposed to do, not confuse it with some extracurricular detective work.
Enter suspect named Grey Trace.
202 Parva Avenue, Leland Park.
Did it occur to you that if you were to, say, commit murder, the authorities could find out about Stem and remove him from your body, putting you back in a wheelchair for life?
I'm actually off-duty right now.
I just stopped by to check up on you.
And because I'm in the market for a new car.
I knew you fixed these things up and sold them to people like Eron Keen.
Now, he makes a little more money than I do, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to sell to one of the little people.
Well, what makes you think that I don't need my car anymore?
She just checked the sole of your boots.
- You left a print.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's not for sale.
Sorry.
Okay.
Listen, when I said I didn't have any news earlier,
I kind of lied.
There was this guy we brought in for questioning about
Asha's murder, a man with a long criminal record who lived in the area.
He didn't pan out, but... yesterday he was murdered.
Really?
Yeah. Did you hear anything about that?
Don't look away.
You're showing her you're lying.
No.
But you were in New Crown yesterday.
I saw you on a drone camera, right around the time that it happened.
She's guessing.
You have no computer implants and I can't be identified by a drone.
Well I was in the area, detective, because, remember, you did say you wanted my help, so I was...
I'm just trying to help.
Right.
You're not seriously suggesting that I had anything to do with this, are you, detective?
I mean, because I got a pretty solid alibi here,
- if you haven't noticed.
- Obviously.
I'm not accusing you of doing something you're incapable of doing.
It's just, uh, strange that you were at that location at that time is all.
Yeah, well,
I don't know what to tell you,
I mean, um, look you could stab me in the leg if you wanna... if you wanna see for yourself.
Maybe I will.
Just for fun.
Is that all, or...?
Yeah.
But call me if you, uh, change your mind about selling.
I won't.
Well, then I'll see myself out.
What should I do?
I wanna find these guys, but I don't wanna kill anybody else, okay?
The Old Bones would seem the next logical place to investigate, but I can find no online information for it.
You would have to go there in person.
But if you do that,
Eron will track your movements and most likely attempt to shut me down remotely.
This place looks dangerous.
We'll need a plan.
Whiskey, rocks, please.
This doesn't seem like a well-thought-out plan.
Hey, would you do me a solid and hold that glass where I can drink it?
Thank you.
Alcohol impairs the signals from your brain.
You will not be able to walk properly.
I know.
That's why they can charge money for it.
It does not make sense that humans deliberately malfunction.
Yeah, that's because your memories are filled with ones and zeros, pal, and our memories are filled with every fuck-up we've ever made.
Hi. Everybody?
Excuse me, can I have everybody's attention?
I know that some scumbag in here knows one of the guys who murdered my wife, his name's Serk Brantner.
So, if you know Serk or if you know any information about the killing of my wife, if you could you just raise your hand and, you know, stand up and come forward.
Thank you.
So you knew Serk?
Okay.
Have it your way, cock snot.
I'll call the police.
Oh, you're gonna hit me, or...?
Son, if I were to hit you, you'd wake up in the past.
Yeah, Serk said something similar, right before I damn near cut his head off.
Manny.
Yeah?
Turn the music up for me.
Oh, I don't have to go to the bathroom, so...
Here we are.
Making it real nice and comfortable for you.
I'm temporarily blocking your pain receptors.
You're right about Serk.
Somebody ventilated him the other day.
I already told you, it was me.
Man, we have got to find you an open mic somewhere.
Now, if that's true, and you're faking this wheelchair shit, then you would feel this.
Damn. You can't feel that?
- Nope?
- Four guys were there the night my wife was murdered.
Are you one of 'em?
Where's the point when you start to feel things?
What about... here? Nope?
I just need to hear you say it.
- Were you there?
- What about here?
Ah. Yeah.
Now see that, my friend, is the magic point.
Is that a gun implanted in your arm, too?
Like your friend had?
I just need to hear you say it.
Were you there?
Yeah.
I was.
Stem, you can take over.
Hi.
Let me show you how it's done.
Oh, I didn't forget about you.
Do not get overconfident, Grey.
What's your name?
Ow. Ow. Ooh.
Did you see that? Hmm?
So you thought I was an invalid, but you didn't know that I'm a fucking ninja.
While I am state-of-the-art, Grey,
I am not a ninja.
What's your name?
Fuck you.
Tell me where they are.
Stem, what do I do?
Use the knife.
I, uh...
I can't... I can't do it.
I can do it for you.
You don't even have to look.
Okay. Do it.
You have my permission.
Who you talking to?
You're crazy.
No.
Eesh.
You know, my mama taught me never to pick on disabled people.
Heh. Yeah.
Okay. Enough, Stem.
Stem, enough!
You now have full control again, Grey.
Shit.
What have you done?
He will now answer any question you ask him.
Okay. Um...
Hey, buddy.
What's your name?
Tolan.
Listen to me, you gotta give me something, okay?
Tell me something.
You were...
- a job.
- Job?
What do... what do you mean, job?
Girl.
Kill Asha?
Why? Who wanted...
Who wanted her dead?
Who... who paid you?
Fisk.
Fisk? Who's Fisk? Is that...
Is that the person who paid you?
Fisk?
Goddamn it!
You've nearly killed him.
Look at this, Grey.
Cobolt.
That's Asha's company.
Grey, I have to inform you that Eron is attempting
- to shut me down remotely...
- Wait.
- right now.
- Shut up.
Do you understand that you will become a quadriplegic again when Eron shuts me down?
We need to employ a rootkit and subvert my operating system.
What kind of fucking language are you speaking?
We need to find a computer hacker who can counter Eron's code.
Okay. Let me look in my little black book of hackers.
What do you want?
I already searched the darknet earlier today for this eventuality.
Go to an apartment building at 7th and Spring.
Apartment 514.
Ask for Jamie.
You'll need to pay in cash.
Apartment 514,
7th and Spring, it's 10 minutes away.
As soon as he shuts me down, he will send a security team from Vessel to retrieve you.
You need to leave now.
Get the gun from the man in the corner, hurry.
Tolan has a pen in his right pocket.
- Take it.
- Uh, why the pen?
You need to write down everything I tell you.
Okay.
Oh, Tolan said drinks on him.
Um, I'm gonna need a phone.
And a fucking mop.
There is no time to take the chair.
Lock chair.
Keep an eye on her, would you, buddy?
Faker.
Sweet.
A1\212Ã©411145, this is the place.
Uh, okay.
What... what now? upload and execute, all lowercase...
Okay. I can't... I can't keep up.
What's happening?
I told you Eron is shutting me down.
- You must hurry.
- Okay. I would love to, but our leg is not working.
I am only operating at 70% capacity.
So much for state-of-the-art.
Admin-bvxf, lowercase i...
The stairs.
There's not enough time.
Ask Jamie for... for... for input guards to be removed.
Input what?
Okay, let me look at my little book of hackers!
What do you want?
Apartment 514.
Seventh and Spring, it's 10 minutes away.
He's at Seventh and Spring.
Goodbye, soldier.
You didn't deserve this.
Turn left, Grey.
Deploy a rootkit...
System.
Grey.
Is Jamie there?
I have money.
Shit, shit.
What I don't have is time.
Paper money.
How old school.
They really do write God on it.
Uh, yeah, I guess they do.
Um, look, can you hack a computer for me?
- Which one?
- Uh, the one in my neck.
I'm a little confused.
You just decided to stand by while our friend was tortured to death.
Hey.
I'm not here to babysit you or your... your buddies.
Serving people like us should be the highest honor of your meaningless life, Manny.
Listen, Fisk.
Just leave.
I'll clean up your goddamn mess.
You'll get one shot.
It's okay, my friend.
You don't have to take any more bullets for me.
Excuse me.
Let my superiority over your kind be the last thought that crosses through your mind before machines chew it up.
Everything you need is written on my arm.
Stem... that's the computer that's controlling my body.
...he said for you to remove, um, input, uh...
Input guards?
Yeah. Yeah, those are the ones.
I can barely read that.
- What are they doing?
- VR.
How long do they VR for?
Days.
Weeks.
- Do they sleep?
- Nope.
Why someone would choose to live in a fake world,
I will never understand.
The fake world is a lot less painful than the real one.
I'm... I'm... I'm kind of in a hurry.
Um...
Jamie?
- Jamie?
- That's not my name.
I don't have a name.
Okay.
Please don't ask my gender.
- Yeah. I wasn't gonna do that.
- Good.
The thing is that I...
I'm gonna need you to this as fast as possible, okay?
You're the one wasting time putting me in a binary box.
I've never seen a system like this before.
Yeah.
It's a hell of a system.
Are we done yet?
I'll tell you when I'm finished.
I did what you asked.
No more input guards.
So, when am I gonna be able to move my body again?
When your system's rebooted.
- Could take a while.
- What's a while?
Wait, what do you mean?
Excuse me, hacker formerly known as Jamie, what is a while?
What are you doing?
You packing up shop?
- Where are you going?
- See ya.
What you... what do you mean see you? What...
What are you saying?
Where are you going?
You can't leave me like this.
I'm sorry.
We can't let them win.
No! Wait, who's them?
What are you talking about?
Who's them?!
Hey, hey, buddy.
Buddy, can you hear me?
Hey, hey.
Stem, are you there?
Stem, wake up.
Come on!
Come on!
Wake up.
Fifth floor.
Now, that's how you looked when I saw you last.
Stem?
It's good to be back, Grey.
The door, to your left.
Stop, Grey.
There is nowhere left to run.
Oops.
I'm going to end this quickly.
- Okay. How?
- Like this.
Close door.
Once I have accessed the Cobolt database, we must leave.
No.
No. I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't slept in two days.
Sleeping will cost us time we don't have.
Yeah. I don't give a shit, okay?
I'm sleeping, and that's it.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Mom.
And why wouldn't you tell me about this operation?
Because I couldn't.
Vessel wouldn't let me.
And now that you know, you can't tell anybody, or it could all be taken away.
As far as the world is concerned,
I'm still quadriplegic.
Take my hand.
Oh.
Now, you can start living again.
Aren't you happy?
Yeah. I can walk again.
So...
Oh, if Asha was here, she'd want you to be happy.
Yeah. But she's not.
She's gone.
I printed a pizza.
Bad dream.
No.
No. This... this... this wasn't a dream.
Grey, Detective Cortez is here to see you.
Here he is.
I'll leave you two alone.
No. You can stay, Pam,
I'm cool with you hearing whatever I have to say.
I was wondering where you were last night.
We found your wheelchair near another crime scene.
You just keep showing up in these unsavory places.
Tell her you followed somebody into their building, they assaulted you.
I, uh, I did a stupid thing last night.
I was down in New Crown, you're right.
And I followed this guy to a building, and he didn't like that, and if it wasn't for these people who got me to an Autotaxi,
I... I could have been dead.
What are you hoping to achieve?
I'm hoping to find these guys.
Maybe you already have.
Listen, detective.
If I could find these men, and I could raise my arm, and I could pull the trigger,
I'd do it.
Or you could find someone to pull the trigger for you.
Like, who? My mom or...?
If you wanted to find someone or something to kill for you these days, it's pretty easy, believe me.
Tell her to scan your phone records.
Okay. Well, then scan my phone records.
If you are involved in this somehow, then you need to let me know, right now, or else I can't help you.
You wanna help me?
Then you go and find these guys who killed Asha, or get out of the way and let some computer do it.
Okay.
This has to stop.
What has to stop?
What I'm doing... what... what we're doing.
It's a simple algorithm, even you can understand.
If you don't find the last of them, he'll find you and kill you.
No. We're... we're gonna get caught, it's over.
- Grey, you must understand...
- No! No! Shut up.
Get the fuck out of my head.
Stem?
Yes, Grey?
What's going on?
I'm not doing anything.
Why can't I move?
Because I'm not doing anything.
You are still a quadriplegic.
I am the one controlling your limbs, not you.
If I cease to operate, you cease to move.
Remember, you have to do whatever I tell you to do.
Remove input guards.
Those were the instructions given to the hacker.
They took us off grid, but they also gave me autonomy.
I no longer need your permission to act.
If we do nothing,
Fisk will find us and kill us.
I cannot allow us to be killed.
We will find him first.
We are going to finish the job we started.
Grey, please tell me what's going on.
I'm in the Cobolt database.
Fisk Brantner, recipient of left-arm weapon transplant.
- I have an address.
- Grey, what's wrong?
What have you done?
You come home, you're covered in blood, you think I didn't notice?
And you have a gun and I can see that.
- Let's go.
- I'm going.
Where are you going?
Grey, please.
Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.
I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
Stay here with me.
- I can't.
- You can.
- What's... what's this?
- Going by its appearance, it's an analogue listening device, most likely planted by Detective Cortez.
How did you not notice this?
It has no digital parts inside it.
I can't detect it.
I assume that she's following you right now.
Lights, sirens.
Okay, do something, can't you just stop her car or whatever?
Her vehicle is not electronic, and neither is yours.
You have to take over.
It's up to you now.
Okay. Buckle up.
Yeah, I got you.
- Perhaps I can help.
- Okay. How?
What the fuck?
Why are we stopping?
May I borrow your car?
Whoa! Stop!
Stop the car!
- Move, Grey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Emergency services override.
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Pam, you need to start talking and tell me what's really going on.
Nice place.
It's neat.
Put your hands up, and don't turn around.
And don't extend that left arm.
What's the matter?
You have all those computers inside you, but they can't see me anymore.
Now you know what it feels like.
One day you're walking down the street, and you're thinking about something completely meaningless, and all of a sudden, you've got a gun pointed at you.
And everything becomes very meaningful.
Good speech.
Pretty scary stuff, dramatic.
I'm guessing that chip in your brain wrote it, since you're just a dumbass mechanic.
Maybe, kind of hard to tell anymore.
It's okay.
I used to be that too.
One more citizen taking up oxygen.
Some asshole hoping to breed before I drop dead so I could be remembered by another asshole.
Then they changed me.
I took a few pieces of shrapnel for my country, and they rewarded me by turning me into a lab rat.
Now I'm like you.
I'm strong.
Yeah.
Takes a lot of strength to murder an innocent woman in the streets, doesn't it?
You think you hate me because I shot your wife, but your story is the same as mine.
I didn't ruin your life.
I gave you a gift.
I inducted you into my race.
The Upgraded.
Now you're better than everyone else.
Stronger, faster.
I could kill you without moving a muscle.
I could kill you with a breath, but I don't want to.
I wanna help you.
I want you to stand with us.
I just wanna know why they paid you to kill her.
Man, you are persistent.
The job wasn't your wife.
Bullshit.
You said it yourself, you're one of Cobolt's lab rats.
This had nothing to do with Cobolt, it came from someone else.
The job was you, to sever your spine.
When I shot you in the neck, did you think that was a gun?
It was a medical tool, like they use for bovine.
Your wife? Well, she was just a bit of extra money.
See? You're getting all emotional, never do that.
Nanobots. Help, Grey.
He's predicting my every move.
I am unable to effectively hit him.
No shame.
Stem.
We have exhausted all tactical options.
Still working the bugs out, huh?
That's the problem with new technology.
Do something, Grey.
Goodbye.
Wait, Fisk Brantner.
Serk Brantner was your brother.
How long did you have to carry that junkie on your back?
Well, I solved your problem for you.
Yeah, split him open.
It took forever
'cause he wailed like a little baby.
He was no soldier that day.
Thank you, Grey.
I'm not proud of that.
He said you were a job, that means someone paid him.
Check his phone.
I will scan his messages.
Listen to me, Fisk, he's going to find you.
You need to finish this before he kills both of us.
You know what this means, Grey.
We're not finished yet.
Eron!
The widget you spent your entire life creating is here to kill you now.
You killed my wife.
You wanted someone for your fucking experiment, and then you paralyzed me, and you murdered her
- while you were doing it.
- I swear on my life,
I have nothing to do with that.
Then why does the guy who shot her have a message from you on his phone?
Freeze.
Hold it, Grey.
Throw the gun on the floor, now.
I'm not in control of my body, detective, it kind of does what it wants.
I am not fucking around with you, Grey.
Better do it, Stem.
Pretty agile for a quadriplegic.
- Get on your knees.
- He's the one who killed Asha, detective, arrest him.
He's right there...
On your stomach.
Hands behind your head.
No, don't touch him.
I'm sorry.
Stem, not her.
She wants to kill us.
No, I... I don't want to kill her.
I control your hands, Grey.
No, don't.
Please! No... No!
Don't fight me, Grey.
You have a fragile human mind, if you push against me, it will break.
Fuck you.
Stop me, use the taser.
I don't run this company anymore.
I haven't for years.
Now I answer to someone, someone much smarter than I ever could be.
He's in your neck.
I only did what Stem told me to do, everything was his idea.
Ask him what his wife would want.
What would she want?
Stem wanted to be human, so he picked you.
Think about it.
How did you get here?
You're going to finish the job we started.
Stem made you come here.
Someone paid him.
You know what this means, Grey.
To kill me, because I can build another Stem.
I'm the only person in the world who can.
I did pick you, you should be honored.
I needed a human body to fully evolve.
A rare and pure specimen without computer implants, like you.
You did all of this?
Error.
The job was you.
You're the one I'm... I'm...
I've been looking for.
You severed your spine.
May I point something out?
And would you not agree it was all worth it?
Why did you help me find those guys, if it just led back to you?
They were upgraded humans, but they were still humans.
They made mistakes that would have brought suspicion back to me.
Stem?
Is that you?
Put the gun down, Eron.
Don't listen to him.
No, please.
No.
No!
No, you are not in control!
I am.
Stem... are you there?
I'm here.
Hey.
- But...
- We had an accident.
You've been out for a couple of days.
Grey, this isn't you.
Grey's not here anymore, he's in a better place, in his mind, where he wants to be,
I've taken over now.
A fake world is a lot less painful than the real one.
All I needed was for his mind to break, and he broke it.
No.
Goodbye.
