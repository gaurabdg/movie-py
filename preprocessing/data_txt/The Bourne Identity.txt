What a mess.
You've never seen a dead man before?
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

What are you doing?

Goddamn it! Where am I?
A boat.
A fishing boat.
You were in the water.
We pull you out.
What water?
You were shot.
See? There are the bullets.
Ohh. Look. There is a number for a bank.
Why was it in your hip?
My hip?
Why was it in your hip?
Yeah. In your hip under the skin.
Uh. Oh, God!
You need to rest.
Wait. Please. Slow down.
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend. Huh?

<i>Based on these charts, I think
I may have been closer to the coast.</i>
What's this?
You tied these knots?
So it start to come back, huh?
No, it doesn't start to come back.
The knot's like everything else.
I just found the rope and I did it.
The same way I can...
I can read, I can write.
<i>I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee. I can shuffle cards.</i>
<i>I can set up a chessboard.
Yes, yes. It will come back.</i>
No, it's not coming back, goddamn it! That's the point!
I'm down here looking through all this shit.
For two weeks I'm down here.
It's not working. I don't even know what to look for.
You need to rest.

We get in there tomorrow,

I will show you.
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris the day before yesterday.
He was an irritation before he took power...
<i>he was a problem when he was in power and he's been a disaster for us in exile.</i>
He's writing a book about the agency's history in Africa.
He's going to name names.
<i>It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the agency's help.</i>
He wants us to put him back in power in six months or else.
This interview, and I'll make the tape available to anyone who wants it... he goes on to claim that he's just survived an assassination attempt.
<i>He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.</i>
The director wants to know if there's any possible shred of truth in this accusation.
<i>I've already assured him there's nobody that reckless on my senior staff.</i>
[Elevator Dings]
I was recalling a conversation we had some time ago, talking about Treadstone.
I seem to remember
Nykwana Wombosi's name might have come up.
I'm not sure what we're talking about.
Someone tried to take him out.
Tried and failed.
Was this Treadstone?
You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.
I thought you were never gonna do that.
What happened?
Well, we, uh, lost communication with our man.
This was almost two weeks ago.
<i>We've been working around the clock, the whole unit.</i>
We've been sleeping down there.
Believe me, we're doing everything we can.
<i>And you don't let me know this?
You never wanted to before.</i>
You never made a mistake before.

This was my current address until two days ago... when I started standing in line outside.
Now, I lose my apartment, okay? That means no address, no phone, no money, no time.
<i>- I still have no visa.
- Miss Kreutz, I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.</i>

Excuse me. But where's the guy that I talked to last week?</i>
Every week it's a new person.

Yes. He went to the bank.
Our source at the bank, that's who called.
- Come on.
- He's got to assume we're watching the bank, right?
I don't know. Come on.
I mean, he cleaned out the box. He left the gun.
What does that mean?
I said I don't know.
I liked it better when I thought he was dead.
[Mumbling, Indistinct]
<i>Oh, Scheiße.</i>
What are you looking at?
I heard you inside.
What?

You need money.
I need a ride out of here.</i>
I'm not running a car service just now. Thank you.
I'll give you $10,000 for driving me to Paris.

<i>You know, because, I mean, after six months in Amsterdam...</i>
<i>you're not sure if you've been there 20 minutes or 20 years, if you know what I mean.</i>
So I went and I took all the money I had... and I went in with friends and we took over this really cool surf shop outside Biarritz... um, which was right by the water; it was amazing.
It was just amazing for about three months... until it turned out that this, uh, jerk who had found us the lease... was actually shining everyone on and... [Sighs]
And what?
What do you mean what?
Listen to me.
I've been speed-talking for about 60 kilometers now.
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.
I'm gonna shut up now.
No. Don't do that.
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.
Yeah, but we're not talking.
I'm talking.
You've said, like, ten words since we left Zurich.
Well, listening to you, um, it's relaxing.
I haven't slept in a while and... and I've had this headache.
It's like a constant thing inside my head.
And it's just starting to move to the background, so... keep going.
Really. If you want, please keep talking.
Okay.

<i>And there's a stepbrother.

She pops up on the grid here and there, but it's chaotic at best.
<i>She paid some electric bills in Spain, '95...</i>

Okay.

Who has a bank account number in their hip?
I come in here... and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching the sight lines and looking for an exit.
I see the exit sign too.
I'm not worried.
I mean, you were shot.
People do all kinds of weird and amazing stuff when they're scared.
I can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside.
I can tell that our waitress is left-handed... and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself.
<i>I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside.</i>
And at this altitude, I can run flat-out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
Now why would I know that?
How can I know that and not know who I am?
Hey.
Ah, I slept.
I can't believe it.
Yeah. Well, you were tired.
I haven't slept.
Oh. Here. For 20,000,

You were pretty out of it.

Just, uh, just take a left.
Go on over here.

Yeah. I guess.
Yeah, but I don't recognize any of this.
Okay. You should go.

Oh, God. Money. Right.
Yeah.
Here.
<i>Danke, okay?</i>
Thanks for the ride.
Anytime.
Well, you could come up and you can...
Or you could wait here.
I can go check it out, but you could wait...
Uh, no, no. No, no.
Um, with you, you would probably just forget about me if I stayed here.
How could I forget about you?

You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
You are a friend of his?
Uh, uh-huh. Yep.
I have some very bad news for you, sir.
I'm terribly sorry to tell you this... but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago.
There was an accident on the motorway.
Apparently, he was killed instantly.
Really. I'm terribly sorry to be the one to tell you this.
When they came for his things, people made note for us, you see?

- His brother.
Did his, uh, brother leave a number or a way to get in touch with him?
I think not.
So I'm sorry...

You want to go, fine.
You go to the cops, I gotta run.
You tell them what happened.

I wiped the whole place down for fingerprints.
Can I walk around, or is that gonna leave any footprints?
You can... walk around.
It's no problem.
<i>But we'll just keep track of everything we touch.</i>
I just think it's better if we leave a room that we're not gonna leave a trail.
<i>Why? Where are we going?
I need to go to the hotel where John Michael Kane stayed...</i> the Hotel Regina.
Um, if I was him...
<i>then they're gonna have some records.</i>
<i>We need that hotel bill.
Okay.</i>
It gets slightly complicated though.
Because you're dead.
<i>Right.

<i>[Man] Sir, please.

They want war?</i>
Then we will give them war.
If they want to kill me, they better kill me the first time.
They better kill me dead.
<i>- They better kill me in my sleep.
- Nykwana, listen to me.</i>
We need these people.
It's hard enough getting people we know to help us.

Wombosi was assassinated in his house in the middle of Paris.

He had an assignment.
He failed.
He obviously felt compelled to finish the task.
<i>Shit. Jesus.
We think he'll come back in now.</i>
I mean, it's routine.
It's like behavioral software.

Now that he's completed the mission, we think he'll come back in.

Twenty-four hours.

Where's the body?
I said someone came last night.
I know.
Where'd they take the body?
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?
<i>People call, they make an appointment and they follow the rules.</i>
